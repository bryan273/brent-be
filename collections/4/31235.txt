1 Basically, one cup of applesauce per box of cake mix acts as a fair substitute for the required amount of eggs and oil. 2  In a typical cake (if you were making this without the box), one cup of applesauce replaces the two eggs usually asked for.. Pour the cake mix into a mixing bowl. Get a medium sized mixing bowl and pour the contents of the cake mix into it. 3. Add the soda. Pour the can of cream soda into the cake mix until the batter is well blended and there are no lumps in the mixture. 1  Note: Do not add any water, just the cream soda.
