That is the only Bugs Bunny/Wile E. Coyote short in which the coyote does not speak, and to use the Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon formula. As usual Wile E. Coyote ends up falling down a canyon and fails to catch and eat Bugs Bunny, much like how the coyote fails to catch and eat the Road Runner.
