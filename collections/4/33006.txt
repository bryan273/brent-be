Fun Things to Do. In the Wildwoods – Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and North Wildwood - day or night, there’s always something to see and do. On our legendary boardwalk alone, there are three amusement piers featuring over 100 rides and attractions — including world-class roller coasters and three beachfront waterparks.
