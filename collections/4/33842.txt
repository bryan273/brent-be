Squash, like other fruits and vegetables, contains bacteria and enzymes that will break it down with time, destroying its flavor, color and texture and reducing its nutritional content. While you do not have to cook squash before freezing it, you should blanch it to stop the activity of these enzymes and bacteria. It is easier to freeze summer squash without cooking. Winter squash should be cooked first because you'll need to remove the squash from the skin before freezing.
