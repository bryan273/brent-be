The first machine patented in the United States that showed animated pictures or movies was a device called the wheel of life or zoopraxiscope.. Patented in 1867 by William Lincoln, moving drawings or photographs could be viewed through a slit in the zoopraxiscope. However, this was a far cry from motion pictures as we know them today.
