Best Answer: The thermosphere has a high temperature, because the smalll amount of oxygen present is heated up rapidly by solar radiation, causing the molecules to move about rapidly (temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules).emperatures climb sharply in the lower thermosphere (below 200 to 300 km altitude), then level off and hold fairly steady with increasing altitude above that height.
