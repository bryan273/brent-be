Thanks, as far as the door cost, what percentage more are we talking for Provia over Thermatru? I know quality comes at a price and most of my customers don't mind paying for quality. Homesealed, have you had problems with MDI on other doors as well?? Was going to use them for flush oak fire doors instead of Western.
