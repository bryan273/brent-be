Education and Training. The emergency medical technician (EMT) field has three levels with the third level being EMT-Paramedic. You must complete at least the first level, EMT-Basic, and the EMT-Paramedic level to become a paramedic. With field training hours and a semester of courses, it can take you up to one year to complete an EMT-Basic program. You can complete the second level, EMT-Intermediate, which takes an additional 350 hours of education and training, but it is not a necessary requirement to become a paramedic.
