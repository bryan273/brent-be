What is more important in trying to determine the cause and treatment of your child's runny nose is the clinical story and typical physical findings. With a common cold, the nasal discharge can be different colors, causing some confusion. It initially starts out clear for a few days (looking just like an allergy), before turning whitish or green and then back to clear again as it resolves over a week or two.
