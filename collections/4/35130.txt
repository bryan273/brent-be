Weighted Baseball Throwing Science. There are many case studies proving the significant increase of throwing velocity with weighted baseballs either using them for overloading the throw, underloading the throw or both (See Table 1) (1). When they say “significant velocity change,” they mean 2-4 mph post throwing or over a certain time period.
