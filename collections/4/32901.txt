About Lake Cleveland Campground. Description. With RV free rustic sites at the end of a dirt road, the West Side of Lake Cleveland Campground is the more primitive and private brother of the East Side. Youâ€™ll still get the total package of great lake access, close trailheads and gorgeous views, with more tent-friendly campers.
