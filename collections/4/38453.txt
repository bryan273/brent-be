My 90 year old mother lives in assisted living and is having chronic vertigo/dizziness with vomiting. She went to the hospital on Monday and was given every test known to man, all negative. Meds were reviewed and her Gabapentin dose was reduced. She is still dizzy and suddenly incontinent at night; wets the bed in spite of wearing briefs.
