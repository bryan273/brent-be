1 Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than a predetermined threshold, which is known as the significance level. 2  For example, if we use a significance level of 0.01 and obtain a p-value of 0.008, we reject the null hypothesis and say that the result is statistically significant.he null hypothesis is the default position that the effect you are looking for does not exist, and the alternative hypothesis is that your prediction is correct. The goal of hypothesis testing is to collect evidence and reject the null hypothesis if it appears unlikely to be true.
