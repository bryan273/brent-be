Today, the four original members of Abba, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, enjoy varying levels of success. Björn Ulvaeus got divorced from fellow ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog in June 1980. The next year, he married current wife Lena Källersjö with whom he has two children. Throughout the decade, he has been deeply involved with the staging and music for the musical Mamma Mia, based on ABBA's music. Benny Andersson divorced fellow ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad in 1981. Days later, he married current wife Mona Nörklit with whom he has one child. Andersson turned to Swedish folk music after ABBA split, forming a new band that released several albums.
