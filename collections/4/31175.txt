1 On many days the tuna bite is very early and not dependent on the change of tide (slack). 2  And there may not be another bite all day until the magic hour. 3  The magic hour is from sunset 'til after dark. 4  We all know that slack should be the best time with the bait rising in the water column. 5  But don't bet on it. Why? 2  If you know there are tuna in the area and you can't get a bite, keep changing until it happens. 3  Change rigs, size, color, spacing, speed, direction, but above all, don't quit. 4  It could be your offering, wrong time of day, wrong conditions or all of the above. 5  Some days peanuts and some days shells.
