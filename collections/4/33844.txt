Typically, you’ll want to cool the zucchini for the same amount of time as you blanch it, so set your timer for another three minutes. Step 5 – Drain zucchini well, mark a freezer bag, and fill. My zucchini pie recipe calls for four cups of sliced zucchini, so I used a gallon-sized bag. Try to lay the zucchini flat in the bag. No dumping here. Also, it helps to suck out all the excess air with a straw when sealing the bag. Step 6 – Freeze!
