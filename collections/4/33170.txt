Dirty eggs should be washed in water that is at least 20 degrees warmer than the eggs. A good water temperature is 90-120 degrees, or as hot as the hands can tolerate, for about 30 seconds or until the egg has been cleaned. This is so the contents of the egg will expand and 'push' out any invading microbes.
