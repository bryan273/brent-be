Mesonephros: 1  formed by corpuscles & tubules that develop caudal to pronephric region; form connections with existing pronephric duct (which is now called the mesonephric duct). 2  the embryonic kidney in reptiles, birds, & mammals. 3  the functional adult kidney in fish & amphibians (& sometimes called the opisthonephros). Glomeruli are masses of capillaries that (along with Bowman's capsule) 'filter' the blood-the first step in eliminating waste products from the blood. 2  Kidney tubules collect the glomerular filtrate & conduct it to a longitudinal duct.
