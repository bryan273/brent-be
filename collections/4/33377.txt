When bone marrow develops, it eventually assumes the task of forming most of the blood cells for the entire organism. However, maturation, activation, and some proliferation of lymphoid cells occurs in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes).In children, haematopoiesis occurs in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia.ll cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. In a healthy adult person, approximately 10 11 â€“10 12 new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.
