Some of the more recent examples of the use of pepper as a weapon can be dated back to the 14th and 15th century when slavery was rampant. Chili pepper was used not only as a weapon of self defense but also for treating wounds and during torture. As a matter of fact, pepper became a popular method for torturing people, criminals, and slaves. It was only in the 1980's that pepper began being used as pepper spray and became a legalized non-lethal weapon.
