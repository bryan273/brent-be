The difference between and p 0 divided by the standard error gives us the test statistic equation. The denominator of the test statistic, equation. is the value of the standard error given that the null hypothesis is true and p = p 0.If the null hypothesis is true, this test statistic has a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 1.The larger the absolute value of the test statistic, meaning the farther it is from 0, the stronger is the evidence that the null hypothesis is not true.he difference between and p 0 divided by the standard error gives us the test statistic equation. The denominator of the test statistic, equation. is the value of the standard error given that the null hypothesis is true and p = p 0.
