The disease arises when plaque (cholesterol, fat, and calcium) accumulates inside the arteries, restricting blood flow. Eventually the arteries can become blocked and cause serious problems like a heart attack or stroke. High cholesterol, especially high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol blood levels, is a major risk for atherosclerosis, notes the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
