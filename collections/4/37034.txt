The shape is particularly important. What could have created the point of the battleship? Did the point help develop the rest of the formation or did the point for as a result of the rest of the formation? Formation Battleship Rock looking up at the point from the base. Hint: Two rivers (The Jemez River and San Antonio Creek) are crucial to the formation of Battleship Rock. The 'A' labels Battleship Rock. The green arrow labels Battleship Rock's point. Locate the two rivers on the picture. What happens to the two rivers near the left edge of the photograph? The two rivers (dried up into rocky stream beds in this picture) join together. This is called 'confluence'. Why does this place look the way it does?
