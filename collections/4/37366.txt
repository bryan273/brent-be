However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length, the parsec.t stated that the astronomical unit of length is that length (A) for which the Gaussian gravitational constant (k) takes the value 6998172020989500000â™ 0.01720209895 when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.
