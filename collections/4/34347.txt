The use of rats in laboratories has roots deep in history, stretching back several hundred years. Rats are a natural choice for laboratory testing for several reasons: Rats have also co-evolved with humans for millions of years. They eat most of the same foods as we do and live in all of the same places. They can get many of the same diseases as we do. Biologically, they're very similar to us, which makes results from their tests transfer so nearly to us. As for why the rats are white, that's mostly coincidental. Rats used in experiments are specifically bred for that purpose. The rats used in labs have been carefully in-bred over many, many generations to become essentially genetically identical -- so much so that they're practically clones of each other.
