1 The ID tag of each AIFF track on the Audio CD is stored on your computer, not in the AIFF file. 2  However, a MP3 carries its ID data with it. 3  And a data CD disc of MP3s, not an audio one, will store the ID tag info carried by each MP3 file. The alternative is to simply burn all your protected songs to a CD and then rip them back onto the computer in the format of your choice. 2  That only works if you have extra CD-R's, though. 3  Of course if you use a CD-RW you can keep it specifically to convert protected audio and rip to MP3.
