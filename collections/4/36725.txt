We call it a derivative. Here is the official definition of the derivative. Definition. The derivative of with respect to x is the function and is defined as, (2). Note that we replaced all the a ’s in (1) with x ’s to acknowledge the fact that the derivative is really a function as well.We often “read” as “ f prime of x ”. Let’s compute a couple of derivatives using the definition.Example 1 Find the derivative of the following function using the definition of the derivative. Solution. So, all we really need to do is to plug this function into the definition of the derivative, (1) , and do some algebra.xample 1 Find the derivative of the following function using the definition of the derivative.
