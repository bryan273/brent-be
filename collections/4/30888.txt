HAMAP is a system, based on manual protein annotation, that identifies and semi-automatically annotates proteins that are part of well-conserved families or subfamilies: the HAMAP families. HAMAP is based on manually created family rules and is applied to bacterial, archaeal and plastid-encoded proteins.ANTHER version 7.0 contains 6594 protein families, each with a phylogenetic tree relating modern-day genes in 48 organisms. Expert biologists have divided each family into subfamilies, which are generally orthologous groups but may also contain recently duplicated paralogs.
