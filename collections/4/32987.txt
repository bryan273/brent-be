The young street rapper has long looked the part, and lived it. Born Shayaa Joseph, he was expelled from all DeKalb County schools for getting caught with a gun in the 7th grade. Since then, 21 says, he’s been busy with “wild shit, robbing.” In 2013, he was shot six times, and his best friend was killed.
