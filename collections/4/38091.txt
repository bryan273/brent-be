Jonah Hex was inspired to become a bounty hunter after murdering his first criminal, the outlaw Lucas Mad Dog McGill. He gunned down Mad Dog while the man was beating his wife outside of a saloon; in his inebriated stupor, Hex believed him to be his own father, Woodson Hex, abusing his mother, Virginia Hex.
