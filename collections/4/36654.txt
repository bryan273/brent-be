1 DAP ALEX Utra 230 previously called DYNAFLEX 230 and before that Formula '230' is the best latex.Note1 It's an elastomeric latex sealant. 2  It's more expensive but, it's better than all silicone-latex caulks and better than some pure silicones.3  I use this caulk where silicone isn't appropriate. 4  It shrinks a lot. It lasts longest and holds up best, but is harder to apply (can make a real mess) and silicone isn't paintable. 2  Silicone Tub and Tile caulk has a mildewcide -- use in areas that get wet, but don't use it in an area where it will contact food or drinking water.
