The first is a sensory pathway, which gives us the facts about touch -- like vibration, pressure, location and fine texture. Linden explained that part of the sensory pathway is a brain region called the primary somatosensory cortex, which is the first region to be hit by the experience of touch. It basically analyzes information through a series of processing stages that extract more and more complicated information, said Linden.
