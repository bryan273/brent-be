Varying between 0 to 100mm per year, the movement of a plate is driven by convection in the underlying hot and viscous mantle. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries in zones that may be anything from a few kilometres to a few hundred kilometres wide.
