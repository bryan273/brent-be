principle of progression. Definition. A real estate valuation theory which states that a property of lesser value is enhanced through proximity with higher value properties. The principle may be evident during the appraisal process whereby two or more buildings with similar amenities are compared; the less marketable property may be valued slightly higher due to its location.
