Why is the sea water salty, and not the water of the big lakes? Is the salt concentration changing over time? It is thought that the salt in the oceans stems from erosion of bedrock on continents, where the minerals from these rocks are eventually carried out by rivers to the oceans. Over time, the oceans, which act as the final sink for almost all rivers, become more salty. Rivers that don't make it to the ocean are trapped in basins known as endoheric basins, instead ending in a lake (like in the case of the Dead Sea) that also gets saltier over time.
