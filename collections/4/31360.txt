PAHs in the exhaust gas are split between gas and particulate phase. A fraction of the light, mostly 2-ring compounds is present in the gas. The most harmful compounds of four or more rings are found almost exclusively in the organic fraction (SOF) of diesel particulate matter. PAHs are present in diesel fuels, with their concentrations typically varying between 1.5 and 2.5%.
