An abdominal wall hernia is a protrusion of the intestine through an opening or area of weakness in the abdominal wall. An abdominal wall hernia causes a noticeable bulging but little discomfort. The diagnosis is made by physical examination and sometimes ultrasonography or a computed tomography scan. Treatment involves surgery to repair the hernia.
