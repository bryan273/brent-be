The intertidal is home to many species of animals and plants. Many of the animals are invertebrates (animals without a spine), which comprise a wide group of organisms. Some examples of invertebrates found in tide pools are crabs, urchins, sea stars, sea anemones, barnacles, snails, mussels and limpets.
