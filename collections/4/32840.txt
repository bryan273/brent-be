Loss of Earnings (LOE) benefits are paid based on 85% of pre-injury net average earnings. In other words, you will be entitled to 85% of your take-home pay, subject to the maximum and the minimum insurable rate for the year of your injury. When possible, have recommended medical treatment pre-approved to ensure that you do not have to pay for the treatment out of your own pocket and then have to request reimbursement by the WSIB. 2  Ensure that you forward all original receipts that you are entitled to be reimbursed for as soon as possible.
