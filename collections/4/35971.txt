Wendy's. Wendy's ditched their old French fry recipe to hop on the naturally cut bandwagon and, in our opinion, adding sea salt was an upgrade. The only problem with Wendy's new fries is the same problem they had with their old fries: They're often too crispy. That said, dipping fries into a Frosty is heaven.
