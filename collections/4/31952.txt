Over the years I've published a bunch of information (1500+ articles to date) on becoming an Indoor Cycling / Spinning Instructor. When you're ready - we have a jobs board just for us @ https://indoorcyclinginstructorjobs. Being an instructor is not about teaching but about coaching and facilitating. Don't ever be intimidated because there will always be someone fitter than you or better than you but they are in your class to have a great workout - not measure their fitness against yours.
