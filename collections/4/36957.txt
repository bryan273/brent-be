1 Because D4 is found in many different products, it may be released to the environment via wastewater systems that receive inputs from different sources including industrial effluents and personal care products. Silicone polymers are also used in industrial processes (for example, as surfactants in certain pesticide products and as defoamers), in lubricants, cleaning products, sealants, adhesives, waxes, polishes and coatings. 2  D4 is not currently manufactured in Canada; however, it is imported into Canada.
