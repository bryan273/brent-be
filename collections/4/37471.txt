Started about 4 years ago. anything over 1/2 glass of wine and an hour later nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy teary eyes. Interesting, on holiday in the Caribbean no adverse reaction..woo hoo! allergy pills sometimes help but I limit my intake of drink due to the fear of a negative health reaction.
