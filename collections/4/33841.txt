Bring the water to a full boil while you prepare the squash. Fill a large bowl with ice cubes and cold water. Set aside. Wash the yellow squash in lukewarm, running water, using a soft vegetable brush. Cut 1/4-inch from each end. Cut the squash into 1/2-inch slices. Place the sliced squash in the boiling water. Set the timer for three minutes as soon as the squash is in the water. Place a lid on the pan.
