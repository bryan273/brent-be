Being overweight affects your whole life, it affects what you do, how you do them, what you think, and who you are. You lose self esteem and confidence, you are unhealthy, and it puts a lot of limits on what you can do in your life. Being fat makes a huge impact on your life, a completely negative one. There is nothing good in being overweight, so if you are not overweight, make sure you do your best to not be, because you won't want to be fat. And those of us who are overweight, seriously try to lose the weight, I'm sure life is so much better when you are just normal weight.
