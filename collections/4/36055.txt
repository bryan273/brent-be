12/5/2015. So pretty here! Came here the end of October, and the foliage was beautiful! Its a nice place to go for a walk or run or to bring your dog or your kids. There is a path that goes all around the reservoir, and theres benches too. You can get some nice phot opps too. Good place to stop at if you are in the area!
