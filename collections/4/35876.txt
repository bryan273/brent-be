The 34 hr rule is a good thing the 1/2 hr break is a joke this break on electronic logs could keep some drivers from making a del on time you canâ€™t run a human body on a computer everybody is different no 2 drivers drive the same. I agree this has to be the most goofy thing they have done besides the 1/2 hr. break.
