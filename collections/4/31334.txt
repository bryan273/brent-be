When Prince takes the stage, he introduces Purple Rain as being written by Wendy and Lisa, then tears down the house with it. Wendy and Lisa were real members of Prince's band until 1987 when they left to record as a duo.rince was amazed at how crowds connected with Seger's songs like  Night Moves  and  Mainstreet , which were slow songs that told stories people could relate to. Prince decided to write a song in that style, and Purple Rain was the result. The album was actually the soundtrack to the first movie Prince made.
