That way works in Windows 8.1 but not in Windows 10. I have since solved the problem by disconnecting myself from the network by doing the following. Go to PC settings and click manage networks then click forget network. Then set up the network again.Where it says do you want to share files-Select YES for Private network and NO for Public network. That's the only way I have been able to do it. have installed Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9879 but find there is no way to change the network from Public To Private. As you can see from my screenshots when I clock on the WiFi Icon it does not do anything. Also there is no way to change it in the network and sharing center.
