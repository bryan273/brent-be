The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that carries messages between the brain and the rest of the body. Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is due to a traumatic injury that can either result in a bruise (also called a contusion), a partial tear, or a complete tear (called a transection) in the spinal cord.SCI is more common in men and young adults. There are about 12,000 new cases of SCI each year.omplete injury means that there is no function below the level of the injury--either sensation and movement--and both sides of the body are equally affected. Complete injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord.
