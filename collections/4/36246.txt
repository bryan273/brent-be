(with Examples) 1  An abstract noun is a word which names something that you cannot see, hear, touch, smell, or taste. It is the opposite of a concrete noun. 2  It is not always easy to spot an abstract noun, and it is common for grammarians to argue over whether the thing represented by a noun is perceivable or not.
