b is the slope of the line. Slope means that a unit change in x, the independent variable will result in a change in y by the amount of b. slope = change in y/change in x = rise/run. Slope shows both steepness and direction. With positive slope the line moves upward when going from left to right. With negative slope the line moves down when going from left to right. If two linear functions have the same slope they are parallel.
