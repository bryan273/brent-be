The Urogenital System. The urogenital system of the frog consists of organs that function in reproduction and excretion. You will need to locate all of the structures regardless of whether your frog is a male or a female. You will need to look at other groups’ frogs in order to complete the dissection.he urinary system consists of the frog’s kidneys, ureters, bladder, and cloaca. The kidneys are organs that excrete urine. Connected to each kidney is a ureter, a tube through which urine passes into the urinary bladder, a sac that stores urine until it passes out of the body through the cloaca.
