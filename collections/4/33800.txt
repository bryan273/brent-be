Public adjusters work for a percentage cut of your total settlement. Once a statement of loss has been written by your insurance adjuster, you usually have a set number of days (usually 60) to return the statement of loss to the insurer if you want to file a claim. Your damaged items' ACV will be be replaced only up to the amount of your property insurance coverage, minus your deductible.
