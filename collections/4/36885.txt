Climate is what we expect, and weather is what we get. Weather is what we get because it's how the atmosphere is behaving now, or will behave in the short-term (in the hours and days ahead). On the other hand, climate tells us how the atmosphere tends to behave over longer periods of time (months, seasons, and years).It does this based on weather's day-to-day behavior over a standard period of 30 years. This is why climate is described as what we expect in the above quote.eather is about events and observations. Weather includes sunshine, cloudiness, rain, snow, temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, winds, severe weather, the approach of a cold or warm front, heat waves, lightning strikes, and a whole lot more.
