There are four types of T cells, each with a special purpose. Helper T cells detect infection and get the other cells of the immune system ready for battle. Helper T cells also tell B cells to produce antibodies, highly specialized proteins that help defend the body against infection. Cytotoxic, or killer, T cells destroy infected cells. Regulatory T cells tell the immune system when the battle with the pathogens is over and to stop fighting. Memory T cells remember how to defeat an infection and can respond rapidly if the same infection reoccurs.
