Another technique for catching halibut is dropping down while others are fishing barracuda. The key with this technique is to know how deep the water that you are in is. If over 120 feet your odds for halibut diminish quite a bit. From 40-80 feet and your in prime halibut habitat. Similar to fishing white sea bass getting your bait under the barracuda is key and right on the bottom usually the most effective.
