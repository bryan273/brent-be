A chromosome is a DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material (genome) of an organism. Prokaryotes usually have one single circular chromosome, whereas most eukaryotes are diploid, like humans. Chromosomes in eukaryotes are composed of chromatin fiber. Chromatin fiber is made of nucleosomes. A nucleosome is a histone octamer with part of a longer DNA strand attached to and wrapped around it.
