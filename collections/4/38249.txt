Torosaurus is a large ceratopsid found in the same formation as Triceratops. It is larger, and the frill is distinctly different, being longer, with large holes near the top. In 2010 Scannella and Horner published a paper demonstrating that Torosaurus was actually a late, rapid, growth stage of Triceratops.
