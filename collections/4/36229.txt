But as the hot air rises, it cools, the water vapour condenses and falls as rain. This creates high rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the tropics. As the air mass cools, it increases in density and falls back towards the surface in the subtropics (30oN and S), creating high pressure.he Real Importance of the Amazon Rain Forest. Rain forests power atmospheric circulation that bring rain to continental land masses from the oceans; new theory explains why losing forests will cause catastrophic desertification Peter Bunyard.
