High-fat foods have long been believed to cause indigestion because they stay in the stomach longer than other foods before passing into the intestine. This might lead to dyspepsia symptoms, such as fullness and bloating. The effects of high-fat foods on heartburn are less clear. Spicy foods, such as onions, peppers and garlic, are also often blamed for indigestion and heartburn. As summarized in a March 2015 review in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease, some studies have found an association with spicy foods -- specifically onions and curry -- while other studies have not.
