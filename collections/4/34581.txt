DACA beneficiaries had to show they had clean criminal records. DACA applicants also had to be enrolled in high school or college, or serve in the military. Every two years, DACA is (or was) renewable. Why is DACA important? The Obama administration felt that minors brought into the U.S. illegally should not be at fault for literally existing and wanting to pursue a better life in their current surroundings. Unable to find a legislative remedy to protect them, the administration created DACA through executive action in June 2012.
