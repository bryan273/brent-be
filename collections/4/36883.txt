That’s the weather. Climate is the average of that weather. For example, you can expect snow in the Northeast in January or for it to be hot and humid in the Southeast in July. This is climate. The climate record also includes extreme values such as record high temperatures or record amounts of rainfall.nd climate change is certainly a “hot” topic in the news. There is, however, still a lot of confusion over the difference between the two. Think about it this way: Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get. Weather is what you see outside on any particular day.
