Strongly dependant on the tide and weather, the night of 4-5 June 1944 was chosen as the attack date. As bad weather moved in at the last minute, the invasion was postponed for 24 hours and tens of thousands of soldiers, many of whom had already embarked, held their breath. The invasion had to happen between the 5th and 7th of June in order to benefit from the right conditions of the moon and tide. Darkness was needed when airborne troops went in, but moonlight once they were on the ground. If this narrow time slot was missed, there would have been a further delay of at least two weeks.
