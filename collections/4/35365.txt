A: Rust is oxidized iron. It can originate anywhere from a water main to your own plumbing. Tap water can turn reddish brown due to iron particles that break free from sediment inside corroded iron or steel pipes. Corroded pipes are common in North American cities, where some water systems are more than 100 years old. Iron also occurs naturally in some drinking water sources. If the water is exposed to air before coming out of the tap, it, too, may be rusty or turn rusty after standing.
