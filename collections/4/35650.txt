This time the number calling was 813-201-0456. Heavy Indian accent asking if I have smaoke detectors. Told him to put me on Do Not Call list and guy promptly hung up. Reporting these scammers to National Do Not Call List is a complete waste of time. They keep calling and calling to both home and cell.
