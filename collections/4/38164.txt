The Continental Army was established by the Second Continental Congress a few days before the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775.he states had their own militias, which they would from time to time provide to support the regular army, but which they might also prefer to support as the militias were dedicated to local defense. Throughout the war, the continental soldiers were poorly armed, poorly clothed, poorly fed, and poorly paid.
