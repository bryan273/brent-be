Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Make sure to thoroughly wash the squash halves, if you haven't done so already. Take a baking sheet or pan and place a layer of aluminum foil on the bottom. Spray the foil with Pam or another non-stick cooking spray. Place the squash halves on the baking sheet, side-by-side.
