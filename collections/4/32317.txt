While the GMP contract is popular in the construction industry, it isn't the only type of legal arrangement used in building projects. A cost plus contract is similar to a GMP agreement in that compensation is based on costs incurred and a set fee. The only difference is that a cost plus contract may not include a ceiling or maximum price. A fixed-price contract (also called a stipulated price or lump-sum contract), on the other hand, sets the contractor's compensation at the outset of the project.
