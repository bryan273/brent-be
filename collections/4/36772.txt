The monthly rate I was going to pay was $14.99/month, so this 10 minute phone call was definitely well worth it. Over the span of the next 5 months, I will save approximately $50. I will definitely set a reminder to call Sirius XM again before my subscription expires to retain this deal or hopefully get a better one!
