Monocytes will usually be in the 4 - 10 % range. Absolute counts are calculated based on the relative number times the total white blood cell. (E.g. 50% neutrophil x 6.0 total WBC would mean an absolute neutrophil count of 3.0.) So to reiterate, there is only one type of monocyte typically listed on a CBC blood test. One is a percentage (relative) and one is the number of cells listed in thousands per microliter (absolute).
