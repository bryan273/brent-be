Sunday: 5-7PM. Country Haven Kennels is nestled away next to Smithville Park in Eastampton, NJ. We were honored to be voted THE BEST PET KENNEL IN BURLINGTON COUNTY by the readers of the Burlington County Times in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014! Our primary goal is to provide the highest quality of care around.
