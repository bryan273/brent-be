Leeds Castle may look like an ancient castle but in reality parts of the building are only 200 years old. It's a classic example of the Victorians tinkering with history and making it look like Tudor architecture. The castle stands on the site of the Royal Manor built in 857 and it is featured in the Domesday Book. The royal ownership of castle started in 1278 when King Edward I made extensive improvements.
