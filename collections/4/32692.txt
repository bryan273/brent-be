The expedition also discovered the ocean's deepest point. South of Japan, there is a crescent-shaped canyon called the Mariana Trench, and at its southern end the sea bed seemingly falls away. In 1875 Thomson and his team recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 m). Now we know it goes at least 10,916m down.f he's right, there are no fish at the bottom of the Challenger Deep. But there's plenty more than fish in the sea. Despite the lethal conditions, James Cameron's dive revealed a plethora of animals at the bottom of the ocean.
