Add the garlic and tomato paste. Stir until the paste is evenly spread. Pour in the chicken stock, and then add your partially cooked rice. Leave it simmering ~15 minutes, or until the rice is mostly cooked. If the jambalaya is starting to look dry, just add water (I added ~1 cup of water during that 15 minutes).
