If I'm logged into Origin already when I disconnect from the internet, then it goes into offline mode. As soon as I log off or exit Origin however, I can't log in again without it saying Online login is currently unavailable and Could not connect to the server, please try again in a few minutes.. The same thing happens if I disconnect from the internet, and then start Origin.
