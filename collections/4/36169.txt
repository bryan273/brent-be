Sometimes you might not even agree with what an aphorism says. It depends on who you are and what type of personality you have. The first aphorism which I would like to discuss is, 'Stay' is a very common word in a friend's vocabulary, by Bronson Allcott. This aphorism is one that I definitely agree with.
