Further testing for the cause of neutropenia may be necessary, depending on the diagnoses suspected. In patients at risk of nutritional deficiencies, levels of copper, folate, and vitamin B12 are determined. Testing for the presence of antineutrophil antibodies is done if immune neutropenia is suspected.
