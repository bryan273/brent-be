Princess Leia Organa 's slave costume was created partially in response to complaints by Carrie Fisher about the lack of interesting costumes her character wore in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.uring a Halloween party at the end of the episode, Sarah appears wearing her own slave Leia costume, much to the delight of Chuck and the other male guests. Chuck and Sarah take another, genuine photo of each other together in the costumes.
