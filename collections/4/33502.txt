I saw this topic mentioned a few months back - but no real resolution. I have about 3000 miles on my LEAFVisit the LEAF Forum. I've recently started experiencing a grabbing of the brakes/regen, especially when I'm going down a long hill or coming to a rolling stop. It's really inconsistent and makes it impossible to come to a smooth stop.
