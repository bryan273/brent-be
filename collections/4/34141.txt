Here the word translated maturity is the word teleios, which is the same word translated perfect in Matthew 5:48: 5:48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. John Wesley used the term perfect frequently and argued that it was a biblical term. But, the term is only biblical in English. That is what creates problems when we try to use the English word in theology, since the word has a different range of meaning in English than the biblical words it translates.
