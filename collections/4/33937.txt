1. About protected WMA files. Protected WMA is a WMA audio file that is protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management). Many online music stores like Rhapsody, Spotify, Amazon, Nokia, Zune, etc. sells protected WMA songs (In recent years, there are fewer and fewer stores selling DRM-protected WMA songs).When converting protected WMA files, you need to install Windows Media Player and make sure your files play well in Windows Media Player. Otherwise, the conversion may fail.
