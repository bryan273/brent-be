So, I know one of the symptoms for panic attacks is the tingling or numbness in the hands. I have had that tingling and then numbness to not only hands but it goes to face and other areas of my body. ended up losing a bit of weight, due to the Vyvanse I'm taking for ADHD, and I know being overweight can cause problems like PCOS so I crossed my fingers that it would help, but it hasn't. When I started having aches and pains a couple months later, I went to see him about it.
