It was full of gay subtext. Victor Bueno guest-starred as some queeny benefactor of a bunch of really cute juvenile delinquents. The characters were supposed to be 17/18, but the actors looked like they were pushing 35. There were a couple of scenes where Bueno, obviously having fun playinh his predatory best, lasciviously intructed a boy that he wanted to talk to him privately, and then the scene would abruptly end and fade to the next one. Also, Perry took one of these juveniles under his wing and attempted to mentor: him.
