In painting and sculpture, the term representational art usually refers to images that are clearly recognizable for what they purport to be, such as a human figure, a banana, a tree, and so on.Such images need not be true to life.f course, they do 'interpret' what they see-hence no two painters will paint a scene in identical fashion-but their primary aim is to observe and reproduce the object(s) in front of them. Thus, for example, plein-air painting-an approach popularized by 19th century Impressionists-is almost always representational.
