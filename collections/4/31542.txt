My brother is shopping for a gaming PC and due to budget constraints these are his current options he's got between processors: 1) AMD FX 3.6Ghz Quad Core CPU 2) AMD A8-5600K 3.8Ghz Quad Core APU. So if you can please explain the difference between an APU and a CPU cleary, it would be of great help. Thanks Reddit!
