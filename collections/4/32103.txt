: the null hypothesis. : the alternative hypothesis. (4) Test statistic. The test statistic is a statistic that can be computed from the data of the sample. Examples are z and t which may be computed in several ways depending on the data and the hypotheses to be tested.t only indicates whether the hypothesis is supported by the data or not. Example of test statistic. Testing the mean using z, = relevant statistic--sample mean. = hypothesized parameter--population mean. = standard error of which is the relevant statistic. This all depends on the assumptions being correct.
