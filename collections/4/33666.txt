Puppy teeth are particularly sharp and erupt from the gums in the jaw in a predictable timeline, referred to as puppy teething. Almost without exception, puppies are born without teeth. Deciduous teeth, or milk teeth begin to appear at about three weeks of age. By six to eight weeks of age, the puppy will have a full set of 28 baby teeth.
