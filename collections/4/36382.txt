An object with a density of 85 kg/m 3 has a specific gravity of 0.085, and will float high on the surface of a body of water. An object with a density of 85 g/cm 3 has a specific gravity of 85, and will sink rapidly. To find the specific gravity of a gas, you must know its density in kilograms per meter cubed (kg/m 3). Then, divide this density by the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure.
