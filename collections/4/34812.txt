With modern Doppler devices, a fetal heartbeat can be heard from 10-12 weeks, although not hearing them up to 12 weeks is not particularly worrisome. With only a stethoscope youâ€™d have to wait until about 18-20 weeks. Also, the fetal heart rate is much faster in early pregnancy than in later pregnancy. In the first trimester, the fetal heart rate (FHR) is usually above 140/minute, and sometimes as high as 180. By the end of the pregnancy, it usually is around the 120 range.
