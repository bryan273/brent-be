Electric trains are sold by size. The size is a matter of scale and gauge.. Scale is the relationship in size of the train to the real world. For instance, an O scale train is 1/48 the size of a real one; and HO scale train is 1/87 the size. Gauge is the distance between the rails. The gauge of O track is 1 1/4, while the gauge of G track (also called #1 gauge) is 1 3/4.
