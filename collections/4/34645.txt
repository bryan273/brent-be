And now Warner Bros. is coming in with its own rival, Lego Worlds, which debuts today on the Steam digital game store’s Early Access for PCs. The sandbox-style game is a virtual world where you can create anything, including messing around with the actual landscape. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment’s TT Games studio, in collaboration with the Lego Group, is in charge of development. It’s currently a single-player game.
