Windshields with special features cost extra to replace. For example, if the windshield wipers are mounted on the windshield rather than on the hood of the car, these will need to be replaced, usually at a cost of $10 to $20. Some cars also require rubber moldings around the windshield that typically cost $5 to $21. And of course, getting the back windshield replaced as well costs approximately double what it would be to replace just the front windshield.
