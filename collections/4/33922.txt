Once that program is successfully completed, students may then apply to the Paramedic program. In general, it can typically take a student anywhere from 6 months to two years to become a properly trained and educated paramedic. And this is dependent upon the school and program to which you’re enrolled. At Indiana State Health, for example, the paramedic program lasts ten months. Other schools, like California’s City College of San Francisco, offer students an 18-month paramedic program.
