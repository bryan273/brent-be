It will evolve into a Nuzleaf. However, it will evolve sonner than level 25; it's true evolving level is 14. If your seedot is already level 25 you can just level up once and â€¦then he'll evolve because it would evolve at 14 and then u can evolve it with a leaf stone once it's a nuzleaf i hope this helps(: 30 people found this useful.
