1 Golurk and its pre-evolution are the first Pokémon that have a Ground/Ghost-type combination. 2  Golurk is one of few Pokémon with higher attack than HP.  Golurk, despite being a Ground type Pokémon with no visible wings or form of flight, can learn Fly. It can fly because it uses its lower body and hands as propulsors.
