Ingredients: 1  1 cup brown rice. 2  1/2 lb. shrimp (I used frozen, cooked cocktail shrimp that I had on hand, and I thawed them before using. You could easily use uncooked shrimp.) 3  1/2 lb. chicken breast, cut in strips (uncooked)  2 tbsp. 1  salt. 2 tbsp. garlic powder.  1 tbsp. fresh ground black 1  pepper. 1 tbsp. onion powder.
