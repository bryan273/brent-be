Reducing iron uptake can be done by avoiding vitamin-C and highly acidic foods consumed at the same time as foods rich in iron.If the blood iron levels are too high the body will try to dispose of the excess iron by dumping the iron into the tissues. If you have saturated your body with excess iron for years I think that the ferritin levels are unreliable for determining if you need to give blood.
