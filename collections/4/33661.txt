Weeks 2 to 4: Your puppy will still be with his mother and breeder when his baby teeth start coming in. At this point, his eyes will have opened and he’ll still be nursing. Weeks 5 to 6: By now all of your puppy’s baby teeth should have come in. Dogs usually have about 28 baby teeth total. Around this time, the breeder will likely have already or will be in the process of weaning the puppies in the litter as they learn to eat moist, soft puppy food.
