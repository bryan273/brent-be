Implantation Cramping. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, implantation cramping, oftentimes accompanied by implantation bleeding, occurs when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterus. Some women might feel implantation cramping as soon as seven days after they ovulate, while others might not feel cramping at all. Cramping may continue throughout pregnancy as the uterus prepares to carry a baby for nine months. Your uterus is a big organ and as it grows in early pregnancy cramping is not uncommon.
