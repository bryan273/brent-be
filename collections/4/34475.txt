Too much time on my hands, too much time on my hands. Too much time on my hands. Too much time on my hands, too much time on my hands. Too much time on my hands. Now, I'm a jet fuel genius I can solve the world's problems. Without even trying. I have dozens of friends and the fun never ends. That is, as long as I'm buying. Is it any wonder I'm not the president.
