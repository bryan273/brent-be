There are six elements in Group VIIA, the next-to-last column of the periodic table. As expected, these elements have certain properties in common. They all form diatomic molecules (H 2, F 2, Cl 2, Br 2, I 2, and At 2), for example, and they all form negatively charged ions (H - , F - , Cl - , Br - , I - , and At -).
