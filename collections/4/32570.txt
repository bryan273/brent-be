Women love Game of Thrones at least as much as teenage boys do. Now Breaking Bad is over, it’s the most stressfully gripping drama on TV. OPINION: Game of Thrones: nowhere else on TV do you get women this good. It’s often said this is because no character is safe, however major: anyone can die. Actually this isn’t quite true. At least two characters can’t die, or not till the end.
