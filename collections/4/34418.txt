Papagano was played by Emanuel Schikaneder, the principal of the theater, who requested Mozart to compose this opera. Mozart died on the 5th of December that year. He instructed those closest to him to play gThe Magic Flute h for him when he is on his deathbed. I assume that Mozart really loved this opera.
