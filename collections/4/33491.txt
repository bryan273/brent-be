A reactor is where a nuclear reaction is controlled, making it possible to create energy or any number of artificial elements. Reactor these days almost always refers to a nuclear reactor, where atomic fission of uranium or plutonium creates the heat used to make steam to generate electricity. Originally, though, reactor meant a vessel in which chemical processes were made to generate useful products such as nylon and artificial sweetener.
