Using a spinal block will involve injecting the local anesthetic directly into the subarachnoid space which holds the cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid transports waste and nutrients and acts as a cushion. You can use a small amount of local anesthetic for a spinal block because it spreads easily in the spinal fluid. It is injected using a small needle which is then removed and takes 5 to 20 minutes to complete this process. The epidural begins differently as the patient has to lie down so the area can be cleaned.
