Bottlenecks, i.e. local reductions of capacity, are one of the most relevant scenarios of traffic systems. The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with a defect is a minimal model for such a bottleneck scenario. One crucial question is “What is the critical strength of the defect that is required to create global effects, i.e. traffic jams localised at the defect position”.
