Even though pro wrestling dates back to the 1920's as the Detroit Territory, it was The Original Sheik who brought Big Time Wrestling to Detroit and Cobo Hall. Cobo Hall was known as The House The Sheik Built. The Sheik and Big Time Wrestling also became a genre of pro wrestling that would change the business. Violence became commercialized by being the main attraction at Cobo Hall. Professionally wrestling changed in the 80's.
