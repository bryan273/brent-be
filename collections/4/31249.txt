Clogged arteries, technically called atherosclerosis or hardening. of the arteries, occurs when plaque builds up inside the walls of. your arteries, causing them to narrow. Artery plaque is made up. of cholesterol, inflammatory cells, fat and other waste materials. When it hardens, artery plaque prevents blood circulating. efficiently and puts strain on the heart muscle, eventually. causing high blood pressure and heart disease.
