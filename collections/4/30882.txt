As a subfamily of Argonaute proteins, Piwi is poorly understood compared with Ago subfamily until recent discovery of Piwi protein interacting with piRNA. We did a large scale screening of insect genomes to identify piwi-like genes.Full or partial cDNA sequences were obtained by EST elongation and GENSCAN.IWI domain is of 300 aa in the C-terminal region and structurally similar to RNaseH catalytic domain, which performs a crucial role in slicer activity [6] , [7] and [8] . In animals, Argonaute protein family can be divided into two classes: Ago subfamily and Piwi subfamily.
