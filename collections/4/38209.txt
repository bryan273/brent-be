Excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle relies on sarcolemma depolarization & subsequent Ca 2+ entry to trigger Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When an action potential depolarizes the cell membrane, voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (e.g., L-type calcium channels) are activated. CICR occurs when the resulting Ca 2+ influx activates ryanodine receptors on the SR membrane, which causes more Ca 2+ to be released into the cytosol.
