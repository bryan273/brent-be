Trauma or injury is a common cause of foot pain. Even everyday situations, such as overuse or poorly fitting shoes can lead to temporary, acute pain in the feet. Foot pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, dull or throbbing. It can also feel like a tingling or burning sensation (paresthesia), which is common in conditions such as diabetes that can damage the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy).
