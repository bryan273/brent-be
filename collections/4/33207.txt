If you want your best chance of seeing a river crossing, I'd go to the Masai Mara (Kenya) in September. You can also see river crossings in Tanzania, but chances are a bit slimmer. The upside is that there tend to be fewer other vehicles at these crossings. In Tanzania I would aim for the Grumeti area of the Serengeti in June, or the far north of the Serengeti in July/Aug/October.
