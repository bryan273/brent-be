object changes position compared to a reference point. Not all reference points have to be standing still. An example of a reference point that is moving is when you look out the window of a car and notice that you are moving faster than the car next to you. The car next to you is moving, it is just moving slower than your car. You use that other car as a reference point to determine that your car is moving. Almost everything can be used as a reference point. The Earth, classrooms hallways, football fields, and dinner tables are full of things that you can use compare motion. Your milk cup is a reference point when determining that the bread that you threw at your little brother is in fact, MOVING. Your chair is a reference point as you run to your room because you know your mother is going to ground you for throwing the bread….tough break ☺ 1. What is Motion? 2. What is reference point? 3. Give an example of something that has motion.
