The breakdown of NOx gases gives rise to increased OH abundance and so helps to reduce the lifetimes of greenhouse gases like methane. Sources of NOx include fossil fuel burning, biomass burning and emission from soils. NOx is also emitted directly into the troposphere by lightning, ammonia oxidation and aircraft.
