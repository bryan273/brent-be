The Miniature Labradoodle is a cross between a purebred Labrador Retriever and a purebred Poodle (miniatura Poodle). They are called hybrid dogs due to their origination from two different pure breeds. They are small to medium size dogs with an average height of 15 to 22 inches and weight anywhere between 20-40 pounds.
