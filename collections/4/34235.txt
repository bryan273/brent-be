1 Fees can also be based on 5 to 15 percent of a project's construction expenses. 2  Designing a 25x25-foot room addition that costs $165,000-$200,000 to build could generate an architect's bill of $8,250-$30,000; using this pricing method, the fee for a $750,000 custom-built new home could be $37,500-$112,500. Hourly charges may start at $50-$150 but can go up depending on the type of work (from creating drawings to inspecting a construction site), location, and the architect's training, experience and reputation.
