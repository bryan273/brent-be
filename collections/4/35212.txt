I hate homework, we waste 7 hours a day to learn stuff and then we have to do homework! Why should we have to do homework isn't school work enough and when we get home from school we don't want to be stuck doing school work at home we should be relaxing after 7 hours of work! I swear we should start a riot or something about homework.
