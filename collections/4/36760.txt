Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: I was recently prescribed Lexapro and was told to take it in the morning unless I notice that its making me drowsy. I have alittle trouble with the drowsiness middle of the day so am thinking that I will start taking it at night. Other than that everything else is fine.
