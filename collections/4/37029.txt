Van Hise Rock was named for the preeminent geologist of the 19th century, Charles Richard VanHise, who was also president of the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1903-1918. VanHise used this rock to show the major structural features of metamorphic* Precambrian* rock and also to demonstrate the kinds of changes that occur in rocks through mountain building periods.
