Several things determine time on market. Start by looking at data in your area, price, condition, location, and economy. Homes sell in any market. Yours need to be more attractive to the buyer than the others. Remember. Average time on market is simply that. Some houses sell in a day, others take a long time. Price it right to begin with and your odds of selling it sooner go up dramatically.
