A: The genetic code is called a universal code because all known organisms use the same four nucleotide bases; organism differ according to the arrangement of the nucleotide bases. The four nucleotide bases are adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. Three bases form an amino acid, also known as a codon.
