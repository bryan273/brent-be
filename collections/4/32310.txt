Businesses often use cost-plus pricing to determine selling prices for their products or services. At its most simple level, it operates by adding up the costs that go into producing the item and then adding an additional markup. For instance, if a company takes a 55 percent markup on an item that costs it $175, its price would be $271.25. However, beneath the initial simplicity of a cost-plus system is a deeper complexity. The simplest cost basis that companies can use in cost-plus accounting is to add a markup to variable costs.
