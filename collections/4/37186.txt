The bald eagle was adopted as the symbol of the United States because of its independence and strength. One of the largest birds of prey (raptors) found in North America, bald eagles stand about 30 inches (76 cm) high, sport a wingspan of 72-84 inches (1.8-2.1 m), and weigh between 8 and 14 pounds (3.6-6.4 kg).
