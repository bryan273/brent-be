The Definition of the Derivative [edit]. You may have noticed that the two operations we've discussed — computing the slope of the tangent to the graph of a function and computing the instantaneous rate of change of the function — involved exactly the same limit. That is, the slope of the tangent to the graph of is.Of course, can, and generally will, depend on, so we should really think of it as a function of. We call this process (of computing) differentiation. Differentiation results in another function whose value for any value is the slope of the original function at.hat is, the slope of the tangent to the graph of is.
