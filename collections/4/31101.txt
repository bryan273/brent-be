There are two methods used to brine fish. One is using salt to draw out the fishâ€™s own moisture to create brine. A crock works well for this. First, put a layer of salt covering the bottom of the crock, and then place a layer of fish on top of it. Next, place another layer of salt, then fish again. Continue until you are out of fish or your crock is getting full. Put in a layer of salt on top and cover with a plate that fits inside the crock.
