What is a 'Recourse' A recourse is a legal agreement which gives the lender the right to pledged collateral in the event that the borrower is unable to satisfy the debt obligation. Recourse refers to the legal right to collect. Recourse lending provides protection to lenders, as they are assured to have some sort of repayment, either in cash or liquid assets.
