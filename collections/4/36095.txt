Back To top The pen style Liquid Accent highlighters actually contain the same amount of ink as the Pocket Accent highlighters. In fact you actually get a longer write out because every bit of ink is used due to the Liquid Accent having a free ink system. The ink in traditional highlighters is contained by a fiber reservoir. The absorbency of the writing surface also affects the amount of ink that is drawn out of the highlighter.
