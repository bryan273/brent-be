Although Mandarin (or putonghua) is the standard and official language in mainland China, it has only been around for about 700 or 800 years, compared to the 2000-year history of Cantonese.Cantonese, not Mandarin, is the dominant language in overseas Chinese communities.This comes from the fact that, around the world, the largest flow of Chinese immigrants originates from Hong Kong. Cantonese is mainly an oral language.ue to the migration of Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong and the Guangdong area, Cantonese is the dominant form of Chinese spoken in the Chinatowns of many major cities in the United States, Canada, Australia and elsewhere.
