Located in the Cloud Forest outside of San Jose, the La Paz Waterfall Gardens are the most visited privately-owned ecological attraction in Costa Rica â€” and for good reason! The area is a combination of nature walk, waterfall garden, and rescued wildlife preserve with over 100 species of animals.
