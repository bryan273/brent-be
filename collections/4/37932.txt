In, Greek mythology the Erinyes (/ɪˈrɪniˌiːz/ ; sing. Erinys /ɪˈrɪnɪs/ ; Greek: ἐρῑνύες [ῠ] , pl. of ἐρῑνύς [ῡ] , Erinys), also known as Furies, were female chthonic deities of vengeance; they were sometimes referred to as infernal goddesses (χθόνιαι θεαί). In the Castlevania series, an enemy called Erinys is based on Erinyes. 2  In the games, she appears as red-hued winged woman wearing Norse armor, wielding a lance and shield (a palette swap of the blue-hued Valkyrie).
