March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, and we want to raise your awareness on this cancer that can be prevented. Cancer that forms in the colon is called colon cancer. Cancer that forms in the rectum is called rectal cancer. These cancers are also called colorectal cancer. Most cases of colon cancer begin as small, noncancerous or benign clumps of cells called polyps. Over time some of these polyps become colon cancers.
