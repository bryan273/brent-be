Because the virus is still seen by the body, cells of the immune system that protect against disease are generated. There are two benefits to this approach: 1  The vaccine cannot cause even a mild form of the disease that it prevents. 2  The vaccine can be given to people with weakened immune systems.y inactivating the toxin, it no longer causes disease. The diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines are made this way. Another strategy to make a bacterial vaccine is to use part of the sugar coating (or polysaccharide) of the bacteria.
