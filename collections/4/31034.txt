Differential Association. Differential association is the view in sociology that people learn deviant behavior through their interactions with other people. First developed by Edwin Sutherland in the early to mid-20th century, differential association helps explain deviant behavior. Different groups have different beliefs, values, and practices; sometimes a group's beliefs, values, and practices clash with mainstream social norms. According to differential association, when a person associates more with such groups than with others, that person learns deviant behavior.
