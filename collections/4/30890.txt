However, the spacing of amino acids between cysteine residues is generally such that the apparent knot in the structures is much looser than in the cyclotides. In addition, there is a fundamental topological difference between the cyclic and acyclic cystine knot proteins.t is clear that these molecules form a consensus structure, which we refer to as the cyclic cystine knot (CCK). The main elements of this new protein motif are shown in Figure 3(c) . Two of the Î²-strands form a hairpin which is essentially at the core of the knot, containing three of the six Cys residues.
