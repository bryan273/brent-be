This type of question is an extremely hard one to answer in a market so full of variables. There are properties out there that sell within a few weeks and there are ones that sit on the market for years. In truth, there is sometimes no logical reason for the length of time it takes to sell a house. It could be a matter of sheer luck. A person could be just selling the right place at the right time.
