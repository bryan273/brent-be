Cells require oxygen gas to make energy, and the byproduct of making energy is another gas, carbon dioxide. Oxygen is needed to sustain cells in organs, but carbon dioxide is toxic. These gases enter and exit the body through the lungs by diffusion. The lung is a network of branching and narrow tubes that starts at the trachea, or windpipe. At the tip of the narrowest tubes are grape-like clusters called alveoli.
