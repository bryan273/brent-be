Can't find A Saved Notepad Document. I wrote and saved a document using Notepad. I saved it to my desktop. I went to use it again and it was not there. I thought I had not saved it and re-wrote it. When I clicked the save to desktop option,, it told me, since I named it the same as the first one, the document was already saved. I need to know what happened that the document does not show on my desktop. Thank you. More about : find saved notepad document.
