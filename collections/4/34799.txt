Variance vs Standard Deviation. Variation is the common phenomenon in the study of statistics because had there been no variation in a data, we probably would not need statistics in the first place. Variation is described as variance in statistics which is a measure of the distance of the values from their mean. Variance is little or small if the values are grouped closer to the mean. Standard deviation is another measure to describe the difference between expected results and their actual values.
