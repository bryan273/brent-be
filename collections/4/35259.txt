VERA & VSIP Overview. Agencies often offer Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) to employees without a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP). In this case you can retire early and receive benefits however no incentive payment is offered for you to do so. My agency, the FAA, received VERA authority in the mid 1990s during a major reorganization and I applied for the option and was denied. My position was not included in the initial offer.
