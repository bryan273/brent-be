Beau’s lines: Lines that run side-to-side across the nail. Skin thickening/nail loosening: Thickening of skin under the nail, which can dislodge the nail (onycholysis) from the nail bed. This generally starts at the tip and works their way toward the cuticle. White areas: Distinct white spots on the nails, also called leukonychia.
