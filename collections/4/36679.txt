Neutropenia means a low neutrophil count. The normal range for neutrophils is 2.5-7.5 x 109/L. Moderate neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil count of 0.5-1.0 x 109/L. Severe neutropenia is a count of <0.5 x 109/L. As the neutrophil count falls, especially once neutrophils are <1 x 109/L, a patient becomes immunocompromised and at risk of serious infections which may be fatal.
