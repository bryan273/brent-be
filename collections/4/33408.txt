[edit on Wikidata] Pulseless electrical activity (PEA), also known by as electromechanical dissociation, refers to cardiac arrest in which a heart rhythm is observed on the electrocardiogram that should be producing a pulse, but is not. Pulseless electrical activity is found initially in about 55% of people in cardiac arrest.
