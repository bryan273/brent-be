Perhaps they will start another for Breach of Contract by the WSIB to the workers of Ontario. As injured workers we are suppose to have; security of payment, no fault insurance coverage paid for through employer premiums and administered by WSIB.Who can I call if WSIB is refusing to pay me for time lost due to an injury that occurred at work‚Äù. What I have learned is that millions of people want to know the same thing. The corruption in this supposed safety net for workers is shocking.
