SUMMARY: In a study of 200 dogs with separation anxiety and 200 control dogs with other behavior problems, it was found that neutering and living in a home with a single adult human were risk factors for separation anxiety, whereas sex, early separation from the dam, and the presence of other pets in the home were not.
