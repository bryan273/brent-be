Both Marburg and Ebola are hemorrhagic fevers, which means they cause bleeding from multiple organs within the body. In the grisly later stages of the illness, the victim may start to ooze blood from orifices or the sites of injections.hough we don't know very much about how these viruses work, history suggests that between a quarter and half of all people who get Marburg die from it; there is a 90 percent mortality rate among those who contract Ebola. These numbers may be revised in light of the Marburg outbreak in Angola, however.
