39 Mouseketeers. There were actually 39 Mouseketeers from the first incarnation of the show, from 1955-58. The host was bit actor Jimmie Dodd, who wrote many of the songs, including the show's theme song. He was assisted by the show's Mooseketeer, a burly animator named Roy Williams, who came up with the idea of hats for the kids fitted with Mickey Mouse ears.
