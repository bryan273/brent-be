And sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all” (Mark 9:35). “And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all” (Mark 10:44). [Act] as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but [use it] as bondslaves of God (1 Peter 2:16; see also Romans 1:1; 6:12-23). Fifth, Peter is instructing the Christian about submission to authority in the context of suffering for the sake of godly conduct.
