Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine is a retelling of the Cinderella story complete with wicked stepmother and stepsisters, a fairy godmother, and a lost glass slipper. The twist that makes it not like the Cinderella story we are used to is that at birth Ella was given the “gift” of obedience from a fairy.
