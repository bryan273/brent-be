Rainforest water and nutrient cycles. Rainforest ecosystems are characterised by heavy convectional rainfall [convectional rainfall: Occurs in warm or tropical climates when heated air rises and cools. ] , high humidity [humidity: The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere measured as a percentage.he roots of plants take up water from the ground and the rain is intercepted as it falls-much of it at the canopy level. As the rainforest heats up, the water evaporates into the atmosphere and forms clouds to make the next day's rain.
