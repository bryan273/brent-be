The probability value of the test is the probability of observing a difference as big as or bigger than the absolute value of r âˆ’ s, given that H 0 is true. Because the probability value of this test is large (Figure 3; P =0.78), we fail to reject the null hypothesis; the data are compatible with the null hypothesis.he difference between and p 0 divided by the standard error gives us the test statistic equation. The denominator of the test statistic, equation. is the value of the standard error given that the null hypothesis is true and p = p 0.
