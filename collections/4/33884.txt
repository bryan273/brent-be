Why did D-Day happen? Quick Answer. D-Day was the first step of a massive military campaign to free Europe from Nazi control, creating a second front in Europe and trapping Germany between the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom. By forcing Hitler's armies back, the Allies reduced the pressure Germany was putting on the Soviet Union.
