When installing a carbon monoxide alarm, choose a location where the alarm will stay clean, and out of the way of children or pets. 3. Place smoke detectors in the best places around the house. It is important to install detectors near sleeping areas and on every level of your home. Also place a detector in hallways and a carbon monoxide detector near heating, such as gas furnaces. Avoid installing a smoke detector in the kitchen.
