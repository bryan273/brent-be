I also sex the birds prior to capture by listening to their calls-- the fluting calls of males is almost a scream, females is pitched much lower. Life Cycle Q. How many eggs does an average bald eagle lay in a lifetime? A. The average bald eagle clutch size is just under 2 eggs/clutch (1.9). If we assume that a female eagle begins nesting at age 5, and lives until she is 25, she will have 20 years of egg-laying. There is no evidence that a healthy eagle reduces egg-laying as she gets older.
