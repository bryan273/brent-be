This Friday, March 20, marks this year's first and only total eclipse of the sun, when the moon passes directly between Earth and the sun. Not only that, this is an extremely rare type of solar eclipse because it takes place on the first day of spring and when the moon is at its closest distance to Earth, known as a supermoon.
