In normal, healthy dogs, the lens of the eye is clear, with a greenish shine that comes out when the eye is illuminated for examination. If cataracts or nuclear sclerosis are present, the eye will appear cloudy. Cataracts appear as whitish chunks of crushed ice on the lens surface, and may affect one or both eyes. With nuclear sclerosis, however, the lens will have an even, pearly/cloudy appearance, with a grayish or bluish tinge.
