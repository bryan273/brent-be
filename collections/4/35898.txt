The reason why stethoscopes feel cold is because the chestpiece is made of steel and steel gets very cold. Sprague stethoscopes are one the coldest stethoscopes. I just went to the doctor and she had a sprague stethoscope and when she saw the look on my face when she touched it to my chest, she laughed and said i know, it's really cold.
