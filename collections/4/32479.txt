Six years after he began looking for a way to make a thin blade, he met William Emery Nickerson, who was MIT-trained but understood what Gillette wanted to do. In 1901 they formed the American Safety Razor Company, and by 1903 production began to produce thin blades that were sold in a package. The company also made and sold safety razors. By the second year the company sold 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades and business grew.
