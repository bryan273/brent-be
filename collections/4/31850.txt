Street food is the best food! Part of what makes street food in Southeast Asia such a great value for your money is that it’s really, really good. When I’m abroad, I do my best to eat the local food as much as possible, and I’ve found that street food tends to beat sit-down restaurants when it comes to local cuisine.
