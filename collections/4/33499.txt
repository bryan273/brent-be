Except in some instances that doesn't work. The specific one I'm thinking of....you're sitting stopped in stop-and-go traffic when the cars in front of you start to inch forward. So you let up off the brake pedal, allowing your car to creep forward. But then the traffic ahead stops again, so you need to reapply your brakes.
