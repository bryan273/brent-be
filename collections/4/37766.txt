Italians (and, it seems, Italian officials) make up their own laws and choose those they wish to obey ‘a la carte’ (all EU directives are totally ignored). If it wasn’t for the large fines for often minor offences, Italians would happily ignore most laws. Most Italians rely on instinct rather than morals or laws!
