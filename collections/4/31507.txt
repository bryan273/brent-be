Heredity of phenotypic traits: Father and son with prominent ears and crowns. DNA structure. Bases are in the centre, surrounded by phosphateâ€“sugar chains in a double helix. In humans, eye color is an example of an inherited characteristic: an individual might inherit the brown-eye trait from one of the parents.Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype.hese traits arise from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's phenotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children.
