Lack of Consideration. 1  Past consideration is not valid. Something that is already done is done, and it does not change the legal position of the promisor. 2  Preexisting duty does not count as consideration. 3  An illusory promise, or one which the promisor actually has no obligation to keep, does not count as consideration. The promise must be real and unconditional. This doctrine rarely invalidates contracts; it is a fundamental doctrine in contract law that courts should try to enforce contracts whenever possible.
