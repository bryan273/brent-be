Hyperuricosuria is a condition in which there are high levels of uric acid in urine. It occurs in 15 - 20% of people (mostly men) with calcium oxalate stones. Urate, the salt formed from uric acid, creates the center of a crystal (nidus), around which calcium oxalate crystals form and grow. Such stones tend to be severe and recurrent. They appear to be strongly related to a high intake of protein.
