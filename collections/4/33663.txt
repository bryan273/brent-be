Molars and Pre-molars. Cows have a total of 12 pre-molars and 12 molars. The molars are the rearmost three teeth in both sides of the upper and lower jaws. These are the strong teeth used to grind up grass and any other feed. The first two permanent molars erupt from around 12 to 18 months while the furthest back molar erupts at 24 to 30 months.
