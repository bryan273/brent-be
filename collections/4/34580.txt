Douthat’s very long argument calling this a “power grab” seems to rely on two ideas. One is that the potential scale of people affected by a DACA expansion is so very large that it dwarfs any precedent. But that scale is dictated by the scale of the undocumented immigrant problem. Even a very large expansion would leave many millions of the undocumented subject to prosecution and deportation far beyond the resources of the federal government.
