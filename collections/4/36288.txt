1. I'd like to know the etymology of the word ginger in reference to red-headed people. In particular, if ginger in this context is related to the plant root used in cooking, I'd like to know how the color red became associated with it. I am only familiar with ginger roots that do not possess any red coloring. A quick google search yields vague and somewhat conflicting results.
