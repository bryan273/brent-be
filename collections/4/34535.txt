Einstein’s Mistress: Albert Einstein’s Affair With A Russian Spy Started On The East End. It’s pretty well known by locals here that Albert Einstein enjoyed a summer on the East End. The year was 1939, he was 60 years old and well past his most creative period where his thinking turned some of Newton’s Laws of Physics upside down. He had come out from Princeton that year when the school year ended.
