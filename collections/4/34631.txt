The experience requirements were at least one year in paid probation work or at least three years in paid systematic and organized social work with an established agency. The age requirement was 21 through 54 and retirement was age 70. Enactment of the 1925 law did not bring probation officers into immediate existence. First, competitive examinations had to be held, which were not announced until August of 1926. A list of eligibles first became available in January of 1927, and the first salaried probation officer was appointed in April of 1927.
