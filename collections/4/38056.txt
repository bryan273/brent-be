More than 13,000 homes were destroyed, along with 89 churches and 52 guild halls. All told, around 430 acres were razed, almost 80 percent of the city proper, leaving around 70,000 of the City of Londonâ€™s 80,000 residents homeless. The fire erupted on the night of September 2, 1666, in the bakeshop of Thomas Faynor, a baker for King Charles II.
