Williams again was too strong and too fast for Sharapova, who famously beat her on this court in the 2004 as a 17-year-old to win her first Grand Slam title. Sharapova beat her one more time in 2004, but since then hasn't won a single match against Williams. Serena is 18-2 overall in their head-to-head.
