The Panther Motorcycle. Artist, cat lover and custom chopper designer Byron Hemmes has made an awesome black panther bike. Yep, he put a giant fiberglass puma on top of a motorcycle frame, painted it black and wants just $567,000 for it. Who wouldn't jump at a deal like that? Hemmes is in talks with Jaguar about cross-branding the motorcycle.
