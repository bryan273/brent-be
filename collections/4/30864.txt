The first computer that could store a program (software) was the Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed the Baby. This was in 1948 at the University of Manchesâ€¦ter in England. Tom Kilburn wrote the first program to be executed on the Baby. So it could be argued that: Tom Kilburn invented the software.
