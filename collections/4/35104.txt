The Colorado Plateau province can be divided into six sections. The highest of these is the High Plateaus of Utah, featuring great rock cliffs and terraces ascending to 11,000 feet (3,353 m) in central Utah. The northernmost section is the Uinta Basin, a dissected plateau abutting the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah and northwestern Colorado. South of it is the Canyon Lands, so named because it is a plateau dissected by many deep canyons. It has an indefinite border with the Navajo section, a region with fewer, less deep canyons in Arizona, New Mexico, and small parts of Utah and Colorado.
