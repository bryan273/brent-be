Three ways to jointly own property are: 1  Tenants in common - when one dies, one's portion of the partnership is transferred to one's heirs. 2  Joint tenancy - right of survivorship - when one dies, the entire interest goes to the other person. 3  Tenancy by entirety - for example, a husband and wife.
