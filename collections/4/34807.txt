Throughout a woman's pregnancy, her doctor will typically begin a prenatal exam with listening to the baby's heartbeat. Although a Doppler instrument is most frequently used, a fetoscope, a type of stethoscope, can be used after 20 weeks to hear a baby's heartbeat. A baby's heartbeat is checked often to monitor how the baby is developing and coping with the stress of the pregnancy and labor.
