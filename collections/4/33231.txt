Metallica’s first three studio albums, “Kill ‘Em All”, “Ride the Lightning” and “Master of Puppets” all did increasingly well on the US album charts, and eventually each of these albums would be certified platinum. The band toured frequently in the US and Europe, playing to tens of thousands of fans at a time.
