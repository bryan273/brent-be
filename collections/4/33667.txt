- Board feet is a unit of wood volume measuring 144 cubic inches. - Hardwood lumber thickness is measured rough sawn. If you purchase 4/4 boards surfaced on both sides expect to see actual measurements closer to 13/16 rather than a full inch. -If your lumber is already surfaced, calculate board feet on the rough thickness.
