A baby cannot survive an ectopic pregnancy. During an ectopic pregnancy, a woman will experience mild cramping on one side of her pelvis, followed by nausea, lower back pain, and abnormal vaginal bleeding. If you are experiencing 6 weeks pregnant cramping accompanied by these symptoms, see you doctor immediately.
