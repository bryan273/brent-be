In previous versions of Windows it was easy to change the WiFi profile. For example, in Windows 7, I would go to Network Sharing and click on the profile name, and it would allow me to change it. Now, in Windows 8, the profile name is static text, and no longer provides a link that allows me to change the profile.ry this: - Bring up the charms bar. - Select Settings. - Select the network icon. - Right click (using a mouse) or press and hold (with your finger) on the name of the network connection you care about. - A menu comes up to let you control sharing, so to switch between private and public profile.
