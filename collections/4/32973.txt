Flower tattoos can vary simply from the type of flower one chooses to get. But one does not have to resort to one flower, different flowers mean different things and a combination or a bouquet of meanings could be the perfect tattoo! These tattoos can be a simple flower or a chain of petals across a sexy lower back.
