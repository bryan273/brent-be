Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips. Add the marinade in the order given, adding the cornstarch last. Marinate the chicken for about 15 minutes. While the chicken is marinating, prepare the vegetables. Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp cloth and cut into thin slices. Rinse the canned bamboo shoots and water chestnuts to remove any tinny taste and drain thoroughly.
