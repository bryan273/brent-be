Scoop out the innards and seeds. Coat the flesh with olive oil and sprinkle salt and pepper over each half. Place both halves cut-side down on a baking sheet. Roast for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the flesh is very tender when poked with a fork. Using a fork, gently scrape the flesh, releasing strings of squash. Serve spaghetti squash with your favorite sauce and parmesan cheese.
