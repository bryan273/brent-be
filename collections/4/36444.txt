Lidocaine injection is a local anesthetic (numbing medication). It works by blocking nerve signals in your body. Lidocaine injection is used to numb an area of your body to help reduce pain or discomfort caused by invasive medical procedures such as surgery, needle punctures, or insertion of a catheter or breathing tube.
