How Cake Mixes Work. The ingredients in a cake mix can be divided into two categories. The first is ingredients necessary to make a cake; the second is the various additives needed to keep the ingredients fresh, and to ensure that the cake has the desired light, soft crumb.f you wish, you can also make a boxed cake mix entirely without eggs. You can compensate for the loss of flavor by using milk instead of water, but it's not usually necessary. You can make an acceptable cake just by pouring a standard 12 ounces soda into the mix.
