In the romanized spelling Hassan, it is not possible to distinguish which of the two names is intended. The ambiguity can be removed by romanizing the former name as Hassan with a single a, and reserving the spelling with doubled a for the latter name, or romanizing the former as Hasan and the latter as Hassan.
