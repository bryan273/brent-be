On these pages you will find statutory rape law information as it is listed on each state website. We do not post what we believe the age of consent to be but rather the laws so you are more informed. Statutory rape law varies from state to state so each state page includes a link to the state website where the information was pulled from. These pages are provided to you as a helpful resource only.
