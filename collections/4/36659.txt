Here's what their tests showed then: 1  You can't judge anything by brand. 2  The best silicone caulks were GE Silicone II and Ace 50 Year Silicone, with Red Devil 100% Silicone next. 3  DAP ALEX Utra 230 previously called DYNAFLEX 230 and before that Formula '230' is the best latex.Note1 It's an elastomeric latex sealant. It lasts longest and holds up best, but is harder to apply (can make a real mess) and silicone isn't paintable. 2  Silicone Tub and Tile caulk has a mildewcide -- use in areas that get wet, but don't use it in an area where it will contact food or drinking water.
