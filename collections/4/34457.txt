Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen passes into the atmosphere and the hydrogen joins with carbon dioxide to produce biomass. When living things need energy they take in oxygen for respiration. The oxygen returns to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.
