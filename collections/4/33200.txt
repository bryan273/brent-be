Tanzania is our home; we have always believed it is Africa’s greatest Safari country. It’s one of the only wildlife havens where ‘The Big 5’ can be spotted on safari alongside The Great Wildebeest Migration. Mt. Kilimanjaro majestically overlooks all of Africa in northern Tanzania; & eastwards, lie the peaceful & culture-rich beaches of Zanzibar. We have crafted & specialized our Safaris for over 25 years to share the wonders of Tanzania’s landscapes, wildlife & people.
