A Chinese “white sauce” simply means there is no soy sauce used in the dish. Instead, the dish uses chicken stock, fresh ginger, garlic, and scallions to produce an aromatic and flavorful sauce that is very easy to make at home. I hope you enjoy this healthy Moo Goo Gai Pan. Remember, you can add pretty much any vegetable combination to this dish, using the recipe for the sauce as your foundation! Place the chicken and 3 tablespoons of water in a medium bowl. Massage the chicken with your hands until the water is absorbed by the chicken.
