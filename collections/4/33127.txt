If you have several smaller pieces of chicken, the weight of each piece determines how long it should soak for. So, a 2lb chicken would soak for 2 hours. 4 2lb chickens would also soak for two hours, but a 4lb chicken should soak for 4 hours. Keep the chicken cold while you brine it! It should be in the fridge or in a cooler, or at the very least in a tub of cold water.
