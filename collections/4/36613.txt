The results indicate the number and/or the percentage of each type of white blood cell that is present in a person's sample of blood. Results of a differential are usually reported as absolute values of the five types of WBCs and/or may be reported as a percent of the total number of WBCs. Absolute values are calculated by multiplying the total number of WBCs by the percentage of each type of white cell.
