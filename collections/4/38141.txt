If a month goes by and you haven’t heard anything, visit the Where’s My Refund? page for more information. If your refund has been lost, you can request a replacement check if it has been more than 28 days from when your refund was mailed. And keep in mind there's always the possibility that a minor error is holding things up. “It’s not always 'the sky’s falling' if you didn’t get your refund,” Ashcraft says.
