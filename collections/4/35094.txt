Still today only half of all voters take part in voting day. Many people are angry with the government and don’t care to vote. Others despise the candidates or don’t believe their vote counts, and don’t have interest in the issues that are up for vote. No matter what their reasons are they need to vote. You can’t bicker about the government when you don’t go out and vote and try and change what you are angry about.
