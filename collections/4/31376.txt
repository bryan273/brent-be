Spacing of potato plants influences the yield per square foot and can have an effect upon the yield per plant. Potato rows 30 to 39 inches apart with seed potato pieces planted 6 to 12 inches apart yield a harvest of medium potatoes, with each plant producing 3 to 5 pounds of potato tubers.Larger tubers are produced with wider spacing. However, certain potato varieties produce hollow tubers when spacing exceeds 12 inches.oisture. Potato tubers need a steady supply of moisture for best development and greatest yield. When a potato patch is allowed to dry out, tubers stop growing. If water is introduced to the patch again, potatoes resume growing, putting knobs on existing tubers.
