Representational systems (also known as sensory modalities and abbreviated to VAKOG or known as the 4-tuple) is a postulated model from neuro-linguistic programming regarding how the human mind supposedly processes and stores information.he central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses. According to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems.
