The Roman civil and religious day began at midnight from a very early time. Modern opinions of this, by ones such as Unger (1892) and Ramsay (1896) maintain that the hours of the day and the night were always counted from dusk, or dawn, hence that the sixth hour represented midnight or midday respectively.
