Those lines are sung by country music singer, Charlie Daniels. Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool is the first line of Daniels' country song Drinkin' My Baby Goodbye. An almost identical lyric is found in another country music singer's song titled Honey, I Do, performed by Danni Leigh. Leigh's version goes like this: Just sittin' on a barstool actin' like a sad fool.
