Keep in the refrigerator for 3 weeks or in the freezer for up to a year (Weâ€™ve left ours in the refrigerator longer and it was still fantastic, but those are the specifications given on the pectin container). Also, do not exceed 6 8oz mason jars (3x recipe) per batch or it may have trouble setting. No cooking!
