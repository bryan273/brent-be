Vinyl requires a smooth surface for adhesive purposes. Many vinyl floor applications are self-adhesive, but if the installation is to be over an existing floor or another surface that is not smooth, an underlayment will be required. This is usually about one layer of 1/4-inch plywood. The vinyl is installed over that.
