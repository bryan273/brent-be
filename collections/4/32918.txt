Stradlin's exit from the group in 1991 also signaled the beginning of the end for G N' R, as they became more of the Axl Rose Show and less of a full-fledged band.t wasn't long before Stradlin had picked up the guitar himself and began penning his own Stones-and punk-inflected songs, which led to his relocation in Los Angeles, in search of his rock & roll dreams. Playing in several glam metal bands on the Sunset Strip, Stradlin fell on hard times, but continued to persevere.
