The most common stalagmites are speleothems, which usually form in limestone caves. This stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the underground cavern. They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions.his stalagmite formation occurs only under certain pH conditions within the underground cavern.
