the process by which gases diffuse through a biological membrane Gas exchange is the biological process by which gases move passively by diffusion across a surface. Typically, this surface is - or contains - a biological membrane that forms the boundary between an organism and its extracellular environment. Gases are constantly consumed and produced by cellular and metabolic reactions in most living things, so an efficient system for gas exchange between, ultimately, the interior of the cell and
