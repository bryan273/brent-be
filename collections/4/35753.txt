Tencha (literally translates as ground tea, 碾茶) is a type of Japanese green tea that is mostly used to make matcha. It’s a high quality green tea, since the cultivation process is the same as for gyokuro. Tencha’s main characteristic is that it comes in small, dark green flakes. Why then, does tencha mean ground tea in Japanese? Because tencha must be ground to make matcha.
