What Types of Flowers Do Monarch Butterflies Eat? Adult monarchs don't eat flowers but drink liquid nectar, a sugary substance made by flowers. The monarch butterfly--like other butterflies--is built to drink liquids. Its mouth, called a proboscis, is a straw-like pipe, which is kept coiled until the butterfly is ready to eat. The proboscis allows monarch butterflies to reach liquid nectar kept deep in a flower's center.
