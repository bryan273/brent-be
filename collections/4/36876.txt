A new HQ for BBQ: Weber moving but staying in Palatine. Weber-Stephen Products, maker of the Weber grill, is moving to new corporate headquarters in Palatine, about 4 miles from its current location, the company announced Wednesday. The new office, on 38 acres on Roselle Road in Palatine, is the former headquarters of Schneider Electric, which moved to Massachusetts last year.
