Anna Maria, Fl. A must to visit when you are on Anna Maria Island! Best place for sunsets as Bean Point becomes in site to the North! A favorite with locals located at the northern tip of the island, the Sandbar also enjoys a perfect position for watching sunsets over dinner, and plays host to over 150 weddings per year.
