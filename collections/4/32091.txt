A: The cloudiness commonly seen in the eyes of older dogs is usually not a cataract, even though many pet owners assume it is. It's called nuclear sclerosis, and it generally doesn't affect vision. That doesn't mean your dog does not have cataracts, however, and it's also very possible there's another problem, as well, given your observations. First, let's start with a little information about cataracts. In the eye, the lens helps focus light on the retina. A cataract is any alteration in the lens that causes a loss of transparency and the scattering of light. The loss of transparency can range from hardly noticeable to completely opaque.
