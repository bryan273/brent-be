Seeds can be patted dry, but roast much better when they are completely dry. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. Toss dry squash seeds with salt and butter and place in a single layer onto cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. Place in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until seeds are golden brown. For a variety, other seasoned salts, such as garlic salt, can be used in place of regular salt.
