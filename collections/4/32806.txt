Your filing status. Every taxpayer who does not itemize their deductions is eligible to claim a standard deduction. Federal law determines the amount of these deductions each year and bases the amount you can claim on your filing status. In 2014, if you file single or married filing separately, your standard deduction is $6,200; if head of household the amount increases to $9,100.
