In the male, locate the two large testes on the dorsal body wall, which look like small lobes of the liver. They lead by a series of small ducts called vasa efferentia (which are undeveloped kidney tubules) into the opisthonephric (mesonephric) or Wolffian duct, which is convoluted and on top of the kidney.n the male, locate the two large testes on the dorsal body wall, which look like small lobes of the liver.
