During this lunar phase, you're encouraged to reflect, recharge, and reassess where you are in life. The full moon of January, known as the Wolf Moon, the Hunger Moon, and the Cold Moon, is a particularly advantageous opportunity to reset. This isn't just a chance to prepare for a new month â€” this is your chance to reflect upon the new year. The full moon will crest this Thursday, January 12, at 6:34 a.m. EST.
