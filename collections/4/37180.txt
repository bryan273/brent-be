Egg Laying: Eggs take 3 or 4 days to move from the ovary through the oviduct where they collect the surrounding protein and membranes and finally the shell. One to three eggs are laid by bald eagles though there is at least a record of four eggs appearing in a Montana nest. Other instances of 4 eggs were known to result from two females laying in the same nest during the same season. Each egg is laid about 3 days apart. Incubation starts with the laying of the first egg.
