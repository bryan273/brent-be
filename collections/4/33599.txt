To kill the maggots with vinegar, pour white vinegar directly over maggots living in garbage cans. Alternatively, fill a bucket with pure white vinegar and place any maggots found inside the bucket. Let the maggots sit in the vinegar for 20 to 30 minutes before discarding the dead bodies and vinegar.
