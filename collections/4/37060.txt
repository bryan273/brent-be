From the Author. I used to live in a little coastal town called Pacifica, about 10 miles North of the Moss Beach Distillary, formerly known as the speakeasy, Frank's Place. This is the setting for The First Full Moon. The area is just on the other side of a mountain range that separates it from San Francisco and the Bay.
