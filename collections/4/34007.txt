What is Theatre? In the theatre we see men and women in action-what they do and why they do it-and we discover insight about our world by seeing through others' eyes. Theatre is a major form of human expression, taking place in the present, but connecting us to other times and places. Through characterization, design, and technology, theatre artists provide a window into the human condition. Theatre is both visual and aural, a shared experience between audience and performers.
