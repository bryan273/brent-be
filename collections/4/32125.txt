this is the mirror and the light over it. this is what I want to replace it with - the globes will be a bit different tho. they'll be part frosted and part clear. Thank you for reporting this comment. Steph we have a 42 inch tall mirror on the bathroom wall. there is no way I am going to try to take it down. So I am stuck with the light that is already there. It is similar to your light only we have the open part of the globes facing upwards.
