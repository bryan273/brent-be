The thermosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere above the mesosphere. The thermosphere extends from 50 to 55 miles (80-90 km) above sea level, with the upper limit undefined â€¦ .The temperature in the thermosphere initially rises rapidly with heights up to about 120 miles (200 km) and thereafter increases more slowly.espite the air molecules present, the thermosphere is essentially a vacuum. The International Space Station orbits within the thermosphere, at an altitude of 280 to 460 kilometers (175 to 285 miles). The range of the thermosphere is from about 100 to 600 kilometers (60 to 360 miles) above the Earth's surface.
