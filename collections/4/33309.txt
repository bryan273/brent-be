Lowes Flooring Installation Estimates. After purchasing $135 of inlaid flooring I asked how much they would get to install it. I was told $1.50 a Square Ft. and if it needed underlayment it would be an additional $1.75 a SF. I paid them the $35 refundable estimate they had a man come out and he would contact the store with my estimate.
