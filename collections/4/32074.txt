A speaker produces sound because the electricity moving through the voice coil generates a magnetic field (it becomes an electromagnet), which pushes or pulls against the magnetic field generated across the pole pieces by the permanent magnet structure (the neodymium magnet in our speakers), and as the voice coil is connected directly to the woofer cone the movement of the voice coil thus moves the woofer cone.
