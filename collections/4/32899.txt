COMMENTS: Located on the old Cleveland road off of Idaho State Route 34. REMAINS: Parts of the swimming pool and a few manufactured homes. Cleveland once boasted a post office, store, school, community swimming pool, and an LDS church. Its population dwindled in the 1950's. Today a few manufactured homes are still there along with some of the structures for the swimming pool.
