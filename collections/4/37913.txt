According to a May study by U.S. researchers on mice, eating late at night can make you gain a few extra pounds, according to The Daily Mail. But Remmer says contrary to this popular belief, foods that you eat right before bed aren't directly stored as fat. This is a myth.What matters when it comes to weight, is the total calories consumed in any given day, not the timing of these calories.oods that are high in fat, fibre or protein are slower to digest. If someone were to eat eggs and bacon right before bed, they'll likely feel uncomfortable and won't be able to sleep. They may also feel full and bloated in the morning, she tells The Huffington Post Canada.
