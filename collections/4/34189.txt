People of the Netherlands. That’s the first time I’ve heard anyone say that the Dutch adore the Belgians, and that the Belgians don’t like the Dutch. It’s not a stupid question, but the assumptions are dubious. In any case, I think the difference between the Dutch and Belgians is the difference in attitude.
