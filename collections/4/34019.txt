There is also a faculty of theology at the university of Strasbourg-the only French state university to have one. When in 1882 Jules Ferry took religion out of the school curriculum in France, Alsace and the Moselle were at the time attached to Germany. These areas became French again in 1918, but kept some of their own laws, including the concordat between the state and the church, dating back to the early nineteenth century.
