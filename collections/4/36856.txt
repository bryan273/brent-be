Q: What is a Qualified Personal Residence Trust? A Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT) is a way you can give your home away and live in it too. It involves transferring your home to another party (usually children) at a reduced transfer tax cost. The idea is that the value today of the right to receive $100 in 5 years, is less than the value of the right to receive it now.
