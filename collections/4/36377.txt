The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density, no matter how small or large the fraction is. For example, beryllium has a specific gravity (sg) of 1.84 (1840 kg/mÂ³). As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units.
