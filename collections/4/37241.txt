Transient acantholytic dermatosis causes a truncal rash characterised by acantholysis on histopathology. It can be transient, as the name suggests, in contrast to the rare and persistent inherited acantholytic dermatoses, Darier disease and Hailey-Hailey disease. Transient acantholytic dermatosis is also known as Grover disease.
