Clad with bright white marble and surrounded by statuesque palm trees, the Kona Hawaii Temple is a handsome landmark along Queen Ka'ahumanu Highway. The temple is located in the coastal community of Kailua-Kona on the Big Island, just 8 miles south of the Kona International Airport. Built on a hillside above the stake center for the Kona Hawaii Stake, the temple features a pair of staircases flanking a beautiful garden area with palm trees and a terraced water feature.
