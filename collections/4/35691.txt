Several methods have been developed to facilitate this transformation at high frequency in the lab. 1  Yeast cells may be treated with enzymes to degrade their cell walls, yielding spheroplasts. 2  Exposing intact yeast cells to alkali cations such as those of cesium or lithium allows the cells to take up plasmid DNA.
