Insurance Claims. Hail, wind and storm damage are considered an insurance loss on your homeownerâ€™s policy. Most insurance companies will pay the entire cost, less your deductible, for replacing the roof if it is damaged. The claim is also considered a natural disaster and does not count against you for future rate increases.
