A real estate broker is a person licensed to negotiate and arrange real estate transactions. It would include writing contracts for listing and purchasing homes, land, and commercial properties. The broker is a higher level license than a real estate agent and would be authorized to hire real estate agents to work under the broker's supervision. In some states, every licensed professional is licensed as a broker, such as in Colorado and New Mexico.
