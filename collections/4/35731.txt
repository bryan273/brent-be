My daughter Sima was born on Jly 27th 1992. So we will be celebrating Sima's birth day Wednesday July 28th 2010. 6:00 PM at the ITKA Headquarters 5945 Irving Park Road in Chicago. Losing mother and sister for Sophia and Mike and wife and child for me has been one of the most devestating experiences. We lost Sima and zahra (my wife) on December 2003 in a tragic earthquake in Bam while they were visiting.
