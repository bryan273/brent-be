The Duprees. Biography by Richie Unterberger. Perhaps the most pop-sounding of the Italian-American rock ‘n’ roll vocal groups from the 1950s and early '60s. Artist Biography by Richie Unterberger. One of the final Italian doo wop groups to make a wave in the early '60s, the Duprees were in some senses not a rock & roll act at all. They relied on updates of pre-rock pop standards for most of their material, dressed up in classy big band arrangements.
