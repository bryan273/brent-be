However, the process varies with the kind of cell. Somatic, or body cells, such as those that make up skin, hair, and muscle, are duplicated by mitosis. The sex cells, sperm and ova, are produced by meiosis in special tissues of male testes and female ovaries. Since the vast majority of our cells are somatic, mitosis is the most common form of cell replication.
