1 Fischer Esterification is the name given to the acid-catalysed reaction between an alkanoic acid (carboxylic acid) and an alkanol (alcohol).  Esters of the low molar mass alkanoic acids and alkanols have fragrant, fruity odours, and are used in perfumes and artificial flavourings. Esters are also used as solvents.
