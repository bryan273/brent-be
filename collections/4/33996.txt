These relationships are called symbiotic relationships. The symbiont always benefits, but the host can be affected in one of three different ways: Mutualism: both the symbiontâ€¦ and the host benefit Commensalism: the symbiont benefits and the host is unharmed Parasitism: the symbiont benefits and the host is harmed.
