Put your tools into the steamer, close the lid on the pot, and put the pot on a flame to boil. After sterilizing tools, let them dry. Do not touch them, or they will not be sterile anymore! Use sterilized tongs, chopsticks, or spoons to pick the tools out of the pot. Move them directly to a sterilized container.
