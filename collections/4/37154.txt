What It Is Edit. The Crafting Dead is a series that Pat and Jen made. In this series, they must survive countless attacks from Jen and also protect an army base which seems to be the target of Herobrine's anger. They must use the provided resources (they are not supposed to craft anything) to blow stuff up, lava bomb things, and shoot everything and anything. Oh, and try not to fall into holes. That is Herobrine's (a.k.a. Jen's) favorite spot and base of operations. And maybe along the way they will become heroes.
