Whilst the Erinyes were usually described as three maiden goddesses, the Erinys Telphousia was usually a by-name for the wrathful goddess Demeter, who was worshipped under the title of Erinys in the Arkadian town of Thelpousa. In the Castlevania series, an enemy called Erinys is based on Erinyes. 2  In the games, she appears as red-hued winged woman wearing Norse armor, wielding a lance and shield (a palette swap of the blue-hued Valkyrie).
