April - Pink Moon. The first Full Moon in April is sometimes called the Paschal Moon in the ecclesiastical calendar because it is used to calcualate the date for Easter - the first Sunday after the Paschal Moon is Easter. The name Pink Moon comes from the pink flowers – phlox – that grow in many places at the beginning of spring.
