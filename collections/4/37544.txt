While fishing for halibut this way, you may also catch a surprise white sea bass or a deep running barracuda. If the barracuda are in too great of numbers using larger bait such as a mackerel may keep them away just make sure to increase your hook size accordingly. Another technique is dragging the front edge of a reef.
