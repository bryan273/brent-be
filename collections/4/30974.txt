Date: This returns only the date component of the DateTime. It has the time value set to 12 midnight (00:00:00).. Day, Month, Year: These return a component of the time. Note that this is not the interval since any other date.he year from Today will be used. Tip: This method is ideal for when you want to count days, as for a database range query for a certain year. Tip 2: It is better to use the DateTime constructor, rather than DateTime.Parse. This is faster and has clearer syntax.
