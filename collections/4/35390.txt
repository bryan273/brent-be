By graphing this data, one obtains the supply curve as shown below: Supply Curve As with the demand curve, the convention of the supply curve is to display quantity supplied on the x-axis as the independent variable and price on the y-axis as the dependent variable. The law of supply states that the higher the price, the larger the quantity supplied, all other things constant. The law of supply is demonstrated by the upward slope of the supply curve. As with the demand curve, the supply curve often is approximated as a straight line to simplify analysis. A straight-line supply function would have the following structure: Quantity = a + (b x Price) where a and b are constant for each supply curve. A change in price results in a change in quantity supplied and represents movement along the supply curve. Shifts in the Supply Curve
