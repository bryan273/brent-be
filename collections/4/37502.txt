It's been longer than 21 days since the IRS received my return and I havenâ€™t gotten my refund. Why? Some tax returns take longer to process than others for many reasons, including when a return: Includes errors; Is incomplete; Is affected by identity theft or fraud; Includes a claim filed for an Earned Income Tax Credit or an Additional Child Tax Credit.
