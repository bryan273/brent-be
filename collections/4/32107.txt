Using a right tail test and alpha = 0.05 the critical t is: 2.13. Since the test statistic (1.98) lies to the left of the critical t (2.13), we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the difference between pre-test score and post-test score is zero.he critical region is the set of z scores that will cause us to reject the null hypothesis. For example if we were doing a two tail test with alpha set at 0.05 the critical region would be determined as shown below.
