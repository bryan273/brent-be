Cover the pebbles with a thin layer of loose charcoal, which will help keep the water in your garden from stagnating. 3. Cover the charcoal with an inch layer of sphagnum moss. Look in the aquarium/terrarium section of a pet store for the pebbles, charcoal, and moss. 4. Now, add enough potting soil so that the total contents occupy about 1/4 of the container. There will be some settling of the layers. Mine settled about 3/4â€³ over about 6 months, so add extra soil to account for this.
