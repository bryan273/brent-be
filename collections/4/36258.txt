The grapefruit diet has outlasted most fad diets. People were even trying it back in the 1930s. Its fans claim that grapefruit contains certain enzymes that, when eaten before other foods, help burn off fat. The diet, which has several variations, lasts 10-12 days and claims to help you lose as much as 10 pounds.
