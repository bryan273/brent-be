Selling Back Extra Leave Time. Surplus leave can be sold back at the time of reenlistment and separation or retirement. Each day of leave saved can be sold back for one day's base pay. A military member can only sell back a maximum of 60 days of leave during his entire military career. S/he can spread those 60 days out over different periods, for example, s/he may sell back 10 days of leave during his first re-enlistment, then 10 days during his next re-enlistment, and so on.
