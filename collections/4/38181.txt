What's on it and how long is it? The ISEE has five sections: one vocabulary, one reading comprehension, two math, and one essay writing. It is about two-and-a-half hours long. When should kids take the test? You will probably get your best score if you take it in December, because you'll have covered more material in school. You could also take it in January, but most kids want to get it over with before winter break.
