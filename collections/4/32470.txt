Vernacular is the term given to indigenous forms of building construction. Some refer to vernacular buildings built after mill-sawn lumber was available as National Style. Buildings continued to be built according to the earlier traditional folk forms, but with widely available lumber some new shape innovations occurred. Some may have details taken from high styles such as Greek Revival or Colonial Revival. Others may have later high style modifications.
