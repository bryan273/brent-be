Hemoglobin carries oxygen from your lungs to nourish all the tissues in your body. The Red Cross checks your hemoglobin level before every blood donation to protect your health. You must have a hemoglobin level of at least 12.5 gm/dl to donate blood for another person.If your hemoglobin is too low, you may not be able to donate blood that day.he amount of iron you need will depend on your age, gender, body type, genetics – and how often you donate blood. You can boost your iron level by eating foods rich in iron, eating foods that increase your body’s ability to absorb iron and avoiding substances that block iron absorption.
