Scientists working for Groupe Danone, makers of Dannon yogurt, found that when cattle were on pasture in the spring, they were healthier. When they added omega-3-rich grasses to their feed year-round, the cows not only released less methane, but also produced about 10 percent more milk. Now U.S. dairy producer Stonyfield Farm is piloting a program in Vermont, adjusting grain feed to include alfalfa, flax, and other plants high in omega-3s.
