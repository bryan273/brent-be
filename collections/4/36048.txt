It's the perfect path for me as it is around 1.5 miles around and I live about a mile away, so if I run around it once and go home it's about a 3.5 mile run, twice and its a 5 mile run. The path sand is pretty soft and its really nice in the winter because even if there is a little ice you probably won't slip.
