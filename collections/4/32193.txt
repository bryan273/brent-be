If feeding a crowd, we understand going for a bargain. But if grilling burgers for you and a select few, go for the good stuff. Get nice, preferably freshly ground beef, with at least 20 percent fat. Because remember, you can taste the difference between grass-fed beef and the conventional, grain-fed stuff.
