Atlas Gorge (Bonus Map). The Atlas Gorge bonus map is included in the Season Pass and the Atlas Limited, Pro and Digital Pro editions. The map is a re-envisioned remake of the COD4 Pipeline MP map. Like with Atlas Gorge, the NUK3TOWN bonus map is available for Black Ops 3 pre-orders. Each copy of the game comes with the black ops 3 nuketown dlc bonus map, but it's only available for current-generation consoles.
