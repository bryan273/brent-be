Both refluxing and distillation involve boiling of a solution. Stirring makes the solution boil more smoothly without becoming superheated. Without stirring, a liquid heated in a container can become superheated and release vapour suddenly, sometimes violently. This sudden bubble of gas can cause the solution and reagents to be thrown through the condensor, which is potentially dangerous, and can ruin the distillation.
