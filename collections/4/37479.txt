It originates on the scapula, runs the length of your upper arm and attaches to the bones of the forearm, the ulna and radius.esides elbow flexion, the biceps muscle is also involved in forearm supination -- turning your forearm so your palm faces up. It's more active in elbow flexion when your forearm is supinated and less active when your forearm is pronated -- your palm faces down.
