Photosynthesis. Plants and photosynthetic algae and bacteria use energy from sunlight to combine carbon dioxide (C0 2) from the atmosphere with water (H 2 O) to form carbohydrates. These carbohydrates store energy. Oxygen (O 2) is a byproduct that is released into the atmosphere. This process is known as photosynthesis.
