From that point on, Redford had to struggle, like any actor, but not too hard.. His first movie role was in WAR HUNT, in which Sydney Pollack, the man who would become a friend and frequently his director, played a bit part. He reprised the role of newlywed Paul Bratter in the film version of BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, opposite Jane Fonda, for which he received praise from critics and audiences.
