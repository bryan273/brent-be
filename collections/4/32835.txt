The WSIB assigns a claim number to each individual claim for benefits. This will be communicated to you and you should keep it available for reference every time you telephone or write the WSIB. Every piece of correspondence that you send to the WSIB should have your name and claim number on it. When possible, have recommended medical treatment pre-approved to ensure that you do not have to pay for the treatment out of your own pocket and then have to request reimbursement by the WSIB. 2  Ensure that you forward all original receipts that you are entitled to be reimbursed for as soon as possible.
