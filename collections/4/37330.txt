Various studies have investigated the price elasticity of fuel, that is, how prices affect fuel consumption (“Transport Elasticities,” VTPI 2006). 3 These studies indicate that over the long-run a 10% fuel price increase typically causes: 4 • A 4-6% reduction in total long-term vehicle fuel consumption.arious studies have investigated the price elasticity of fuel, that is, how prices affect fuel consumption (“Transport Elasticities,” VTPI 2006). 3 These studies indicate that over the long-run a 10% fuel price increase typically causes: 4 • A 4-6% reduction in total long-term vehicle fuel consumption.
