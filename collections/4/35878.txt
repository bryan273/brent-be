1. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by dissolving in water and forming carbonic acid. 2. Carbonic acid is used to weather rocks, yielding bicarbonate ions, other ions, and clays. 3. Calcium carbonate is precipitated from calcium and bicarbonate ions in seawater by marine organisms like coral.
