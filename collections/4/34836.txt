I believe we are witnessing another major change in transportation, one that will match the energy and enthusiasm of the early days of aviation barnstorming. These advances require the close cooperation and oversight of FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, or AST. AST’s mission is to protect the public, property, and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States during commercial launch or reentry activities, and to encourage, facilitate, and promote U.S. commercial space transportation.
