Psychophysical: sharing the physical and psychological qualities. In the 19th century, German physicist, philosopher and mystic Gustav Theodor Fechner was revolutionary in terming psychophysics. In its simplest form, it is a mathematical relationship between one's internal (psychic) and external (physical) worlds on the basis of experimental data.
