A real estate agent, working on behalf of a licensed real estate broker, is a licensed professional who works on behalf of the buyer and seller of real estate during a sales transaction. How It Works A real estate agent, working on behalf of a real estate broker, acts as an intermediary between sellers and buyers. A real estate agent attempts to find sellers who wish to buy and sellers who wish to sell specific locations. In addition, an agent will help negotiate a transaction between the buyer and seller, documenting the exchange of terms and conditions, and representing either or both parties at the settlement (the closing of the transaction where the real estate is transferred and money is paid).
