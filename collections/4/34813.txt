A heartbeat can be seen as early as 5 weeks, how ever if the baby is in a funny position it may appear as if there is no heartbeat. That is why most doctors won't do your first ultrasound until 9 or 10 weeks, by 9 or 10 weeks a heartbeat will be visable on ultrasound. posted 10/26/2010 by a BabyCenter Member.
