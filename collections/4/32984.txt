A well respected rapper can earn around $200,000 for an average concert. If the rapper performs 30 times over the course of a year they can earn between $1 and $2 million after expenses, according to Doolid.com. As of 2013, a rapper's record deal will generally earn him 6.6 percent of an album sale. If a rapper sells 300,000 albums at $10 per album, the rapper will make around $198,000. A rapper's manager can demand up to 20 percent in commission. Artists who have contracts end up giving a large percentage of what they earn to the record label, distributor, manufacturer and retailer. They also have to pay studio and production costs.
