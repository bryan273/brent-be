The Easter Funny Bunny's job is to keep his floppy ears listening while watching your behavior as we approach Easter. It is his job to report to the Easter Bunny exactly what he hears and sees. The best part is finding where he may be hiding or whether he has left you a note, reminding you of some things that children like yourself could do to help.
