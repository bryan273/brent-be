cgxy96 | Dec 31, 2014. I am making tomato sauce for pasta and using this recipe: http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/19376/..., substituting bay leave and basil with a mix herb that I have on hand. I am using fresh tomatoe by the way, how long can this last in the freezer and fridge and how best to store it? Thank you.
