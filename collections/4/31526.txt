What is the function of the anode? The positive electrode (terminal) in the x-ray tube. Tungsten block, normally set at a 20-degree angle facing the cathode, imbedded in the copper portion on the terminal the purpose to provide the target to stop or significantly slow the high-velocity electrons, converting their kinetic energy into x-rays.
