Question: How long do we need to keep medical charts? Answer: Federal and state statutes and regulations as well as risk-management and ethical concerns determine the amount of time to retain patient records. Patient records are the written proof of your medical care and, thus, the best defense in any malpractice or other legal or administrative actions filed against you or your practice.
