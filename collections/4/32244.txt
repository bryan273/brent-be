Fall temperatures in Georgia average in the low 80s early on, to the mid-60s late in the season. Water temperatures usually stay comfortable -- into the lower 70s until early to mid-October. Once the first few fronts drop south of the Georgia coast, water temperatures will fall rapidly through the 60s.urthermore, the one thing Georgia does have going for it is a 6- to 10-foot difference between tides. Since the coast here is sort of tucked back west of the Carolinas and Florida, the tide pushes into the Georgia Bight with more force than anywhere south of Maine.
