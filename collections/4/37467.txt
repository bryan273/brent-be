I am a Caucasian female, and always drank casually since I was 21. Never had any kind of allergy problem in my life. I have been feeling itchy/stuffy this Fall season, and I've read you can develop allergies later in your life. Two weeks ago at my own birthday dinner, I had 1 glass of wine and some oysters. I started sneezing uncontrollably within 10 mins.
