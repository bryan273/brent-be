The easier of the two words to tackle is predestination. This word occurs four times in scripture and is always a translation of the Greek word 'proorizo'. The same Greek word occurs two other times; once in Ac 4:28 where it is rendered 'determined before' and again in 1Co 2:7 where it is rendered 'ordained'.
