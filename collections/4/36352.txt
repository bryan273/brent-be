Rurouni Kenshin is a manga and anime series created by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It is set during the early Meiji period in Japan. In other countries, the TV series itself is known as Samurai X. The movie Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal tells the beginning life of Kenshin but instead of being an anime series like Rurouni Kenshin it is more of an movie then a show.
