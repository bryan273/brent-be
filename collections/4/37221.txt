structure of the hard palate consists of the horizontal portions of the palatine bones and the palatine processes of the maxillae. These paired midline bones completely separate the oral cavity from the nasal cavity superiorly. The bony structure is covered with periosteum tightly adherent to the overlying mucosa. Minor salivary glands, towards the posterior aspect of the hard palate, drain directly through the overlying mucosa into the oral cavity.
