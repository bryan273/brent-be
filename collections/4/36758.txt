The medication is taken once a day, most commonly in the morning, but some prefer to take it in the evening or at noontime. For all patients, 10 mg/day is the recommended starting dose of LEXAPRO. 10 mg/day is also the maintenance dose for many patients. If the dose is increased to 20 mg/day, this should occur after a minimum of 1 week. LEXAPRO can be taken morning or evening once daily, with or without food. Your doctor may suggest a decrease in dosage if you experience side effects that do not go away after approximately 2 weeks.
