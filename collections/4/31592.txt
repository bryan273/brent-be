Stimulus and sensation are two interdependent factors that affect perception. The analysis of the relationship between stimulus and sensation is called psychophysics. Psychophysics serves as a fusion of psychology and physics in which the physical stimuli and its properties relate to one's sensory processes. Because of this, psychophysics may also refer to a category of classical methods that are used to analyze an organism's perception.
