Recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the greater of an asset's fair value less costs to sell, or its value in use. Value in use refers to the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset. Thus, the concept essentially focuses on the greatest value that can be obtained from an asset, either by selling or using it. The recoverable amount concept is used in the international financial reporting standards framework. Related Courses
