Ras is a family of related proteins which is ubiquitously expressed in all cell lineages and organs. All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small GTPase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction).Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in 3D structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.When Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival.he two switch motifs, G2 and G3 are the main parts of the protein that move upon activation by GTP. This change in the conformation of the two switch motifs is what mediates the basic functionality as a molecular switch protein. This GTP bound state of Ras is On-state and GDP bound state is the Off-state.
