Phospholipids. Phospholipids are abundant in membranes and form the framework in which the other components of the membrane are embedded. Refer to the figure to the right.At the center of a phospholipid lies glycerol, which is a small three carbon molecule. A fatty acid is bonded to each of two carbons of the glycerol molecule.holesterol. Cholesterol is a lipid molecule comprised almost entirely of carbons and hydrogens. At one end is a single oxygen molecule, which is part of a hydroxyl group. Cholesterol is most abundant in plasma membranes, and influences the physical properties of the membrane.
