4. Place a plant heating pad, also known as a seedling heat mat, in a spot where it won't be disturbed, near an electrical outlet. Place a drip tray on top of the heating pad and set the planted seed cells onto the tray. Plug the heating pad into the outlet.ost heating mats do not have variable heat settings; simply plug them in to get the correct temperature. If your mat has a temperature dial, set it for 70 degrees unless your seed packet specifies a warmer or cooler temperature.
