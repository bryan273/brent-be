Pronephros - 1st embryonic tubules in all vertebrates; called pronephric tubules because they are the 1st to develop & are anteriorly located. 1  Number-never very many (e.g., 3 in frogs, 7 in human embryos, & 12 in chicken embryos). 2  The duct that drains the pronephros is called the pronephric duct. Glomeruli are masses of capillaries that (along with Bowman's capsule) 'filter' the blood-the first step in eliminating waste products from the blood. 2  Kidney tubules collect the glomerular filtrate & conduct it to a longitudinal duct.
