34-Hour Restart Rule Limited To Once A Week: The rules still allow you to ‘reset’ your hours of service by taking a 34 hour break, however, you can only do this once every 168 hours (7 days). 34-Hour Restart Period Must Include Two Periods Of Off Duty Time Between 1 AM And 5 AM.: This was a concession to both carriers and safety advocates.
