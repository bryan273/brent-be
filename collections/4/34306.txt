It was through her painting that she began writing for children. She wrote and illustrated an art appreciation book. Although it was never published, she discovered her love for writing children's books. Ella Enchanted was her first children's book published and it received the Newbery Honor in 1998. She began writing the book in a writing class, but she could not think of a good plot. She finally decided to write a Cinderella story because it already had a plot.
