What is shibari? In Japanese, “shibari” simply means “to tie”. The origin of shibari lie in the Edo period of Japan during which the Samurai would use rope for capture and restraint of criminals (a martial art called Hojo-jutsu). It isn’t until the the early 1900’s however, after the end of the Edo period, that rope bondage becomes a source of erotic imagery in drawings and paintings.
