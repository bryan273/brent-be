This means that NH4+-N does not move downward in soils. Nitrogen in the NH4+-N form that is not taken up by plants is subject to other changes in the soil system. Nitrification is the conversion of NH4+-N to NO3--N . Nitrification is a biological process and proceeds rapidly in warm, moist, well-aerated soils.
