This should keep the fish for several weeks. The second method is preparing a solution of salt and water or vinegar (or even wine) and using it to cover the fish. This brine should be at least Â½ cup of salt to the gallon of water; one cup per gallon would be better. You can even use more, depending on your recipe.
