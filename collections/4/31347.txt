Use the search bar above to look up by city and not by time zone. During the summer months, certain U.S. States within the Central Standard Time zone switch to a different time zone called Central Daylight Time as a part of Daylight Saving Time. This alternate time zone is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is used exclusively in North America. In the winter, the clocks go back to CST time which is six hour behind UTC. Join us as we examine which states and locations follow this time zone during the summer and switch back during the winter.
