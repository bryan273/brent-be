Serum Iron. A serum iron test determines the amount of iron in the liquid portion of the blood. Because the amount of iron in the blood varies throughout the day, experts at Lab Tests Online recommend performing iron testing the first thing in the morning. A normal range for iron in the blood, as reported by MedlinePlus, is 60mcg/dL to 170 mcg/dL.
