Notice, though, the angles of the hoof wall being the same angle as the coronary and the pastern. The toe is nice and short and the hoof has no irregularities. This hoof does not show much arch to the quarters as it is a horse that is kept on soft ground. A horse that is kept on hard ground would exhibit more arching.
