GB Basketball's official basketball supplier, Molten talks about why the size of a ball really does matter when it comes to playing basketball. Not only do basketballs vary in size but also in weight, the bigger the ball the heavier it is, so it is very important that coaches, teachers and parents make sure they select the right size of ball for their players or children.
