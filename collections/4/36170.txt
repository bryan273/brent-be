Definition of Aphorism. An aphorism is a short saying that expresses a truth in a memorable way. Aphorisms can sometimes be humorous, but are not necessarily so. They often have some parallelism or juxtaposition to make the point, such as in the example of Lord Acton’s famous quote “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”. Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician, coined the term aphorism.
