You need to re-enter your WiFi or wireless network key. Then you select either yes or no. No is Public network-Yes Is Private. But it was a lot easier in Windows Vista and 7 where you could simply change it in the Network and sharing center. But you cannot do that on Windows 8 or Windows 10. have installed Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9879 but find there is no way to change the network from Public To Private. As you can see from my screenshots when I clock on the WiFi Icon it does not do anything. Also there is no way to change it in the network and sharing center.
