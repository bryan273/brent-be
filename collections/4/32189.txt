1 When you see the first wisp of smoke, you're ready to cook the burgers.  Cook the burgers for 3 to 5 minutes: Transfer the burger patties to the hot pan, leaving a little space between each one. Work in batches if necessary. The burgers should sizzle on contact â€” if they don't, nudge the heat up a little. Sprinkle the tops generously with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
