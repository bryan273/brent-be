Country-western two-step. The country/western two-step, often called the Texas two-step or simply the two-step, is a country/western dance usually danced to country music in common time. Tradtitional [Texas] two-step developed, my theory goes, because it is suited to fiddle and guitar music played two-four time with a firm beat [found in country music].
