Get a pot of water boiling and stick the thermo probe in. The thermometer should read close whatever the boiling point of water is at your altitude. Some dial thermos have a screw that can be used to adjust the pointer to correct the error if there is any. Most digital thermos can't be adjusted. Here is a web site that will calculate the boiling point at different altitudes. http://www.csgnetwork.com/h2oboilcalc.html. Some people also make an ice slurry (crushed ice in water) and check to see how close it reads to 32Â°.
