Motor fuel is used in licensed motor vehicles and equipment; some motor fuel use is taxable and some isn't. Consumers using untaxed fuel in a licensed motor vehicle may owe fuels tax. Consumers who put taxable fuel to a nontaxable use can claim a refund of the motor fuel tax, but may owe sales or use tax.
