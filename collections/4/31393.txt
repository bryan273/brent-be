Black Codes were a series of laws passed after the completion of the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s. They were passed by the governments of several states in the southern United States as a means of keeping freed slaves from gaining rights equal to those of white men. These laws had their origins in the Slave Codes that existed before the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ended slavery in the U.S.
