Ew! Similar to the disgusting comments he made about women on a 2005 hot mic tape 'Access Hollywood' tape, Donald Trump admitted to Howard Stern in 2006 that he'd 'have no problem' sleeping with 24-year-olds. The problem? He was married to Melania at the time! In a 2006 interview, radio shock jock Howard Stern, 62, asked then business tycoon Donald Trump, 70, “Do you think you could now be banging 24-year-olds?” How did the now Republican presidential nominee respond?
