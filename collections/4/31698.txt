In almost all estuaries the salinity of the water changes constantly over the tidal cycle. To survive in these conditions, plants and animals living in estuaries must be able to respond quickly to drastic changes in salinity. Plants and animals that can tolerate only slight changes in salinity are called stenohaline (Sumich, 1996). These organisms usually live in either freshwater or saltwater environments.
