What are embryonic stem cells? Stem cells are the body's master cells, the source of all cells and tissue, including brain, blood, heart, bones and muscles. Embryonic stem cells come from embryos that are days old. They are normally harvested from embryos left over from in vitro fertilisation attempts at fertility clinics. Why are they so important?
