The parent siloxanes include the oligomeric and polymeric hydrides with the formulae H(OSiH 2) n OH and (OSiH 2) n. Siloxanes also include branched compounds, the defining feature of which is that each pair of silicon centres is separated by one oxygen atom.The siloxane functional group forms the backbone of silicones, the premier example of which is polydimethylsiloxane. The functional group (RO) 3 Si is called siloxy.he siloxane functional group forms the backbone of silicones, the premier example of which is polydimethylsiloxane.
