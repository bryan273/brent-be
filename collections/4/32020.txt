CH 7 Membranes Cellular Membranes Phospholipids are the most abundant lipid in the plasma membrane. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules, containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions.The fluid mosaic model states that a membrane is a fluid structure with a “mosaic” of various proteins embedded in it.Made of Proteins & Lipids Fluidity of Membranes Phospholipids in the plasma membrane can move within the bilayer.Most of the lipids, and some proteins, drift laterally.he fluid mosaic model states that a membrane is a fluid structure with a “mosaic” of various proteins embedded in it.
