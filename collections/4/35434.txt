Understanding the progression of a pregnancy â€“ The first sign of a pregnancy that one should see on a trans-abdominal pelvic scan is a gestational sac. However, a pseudo-gestational sac may be seen in the uterus in an ectopic pregnancy. In order to definitively state that there is an early intra-uterine pregnancy, you must visualize a yolk sac and/or fetal pole in the uterus, which is first evident on trans-vaginal imaging.
