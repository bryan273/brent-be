Use a food thermometer. to make sure that the food is cooked to a safe, mini-. mum internal temperature. • Red meats: Cook all raw beef, pork, lamb and. veal steaks, chops, and roasts to a minimum in-. ternal temperature of 145 °F as measured with a. food thermometer before removing meat from the. heat source.
