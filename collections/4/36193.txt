For example, a researcher doing an observational study on the pro-social characteristics of toddlers might code the common behaviors in order to record them more quickly in a busy play setting. So they might use 1 for toy sharing, 2 for cooperation, 3 for helping behaviors, 4 for hugs/physical contact, etc.
