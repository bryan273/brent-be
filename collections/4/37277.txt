FLAVORED LQIUID STEVIA’S. The liquid form of stevia is and has been my number one way to sweeten a recipe. Often because the flavors are fabulous, especially in a no bake recipe. When you only need a 1/4 cup or less of “sugar” these would be what I would use. All these liquid flavored stevia’s as well as the clear stevia by Sweetleaf do not contain alcohol. In their flavors they add vanilla extract, hazelnut extract, coconut or cocoa extract etc. to enhance the flavor.
