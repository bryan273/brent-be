Best Answer: When I first started taking Lexapro (10 mg), they had me take it in the morning. I felt very drowsy and kind of in a fog. They switched to taking it at night, and that made a huge improvement-and it helped me sleep better, too. Since then, they've added Wellbutrin SR (150 mg), and I take that in the morning. I've been taking them for over a year and a half, and they're working very well for me. The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active-and wanting to do things-while the Lexapro makes me more mellow.
