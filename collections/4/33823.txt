Himself. My word is the word of Christ; my mouth is the mouth of Christ (O'Hare PF. The Facts About Luther, 1916--1987 reprint ed., pp. 203-204). The Bible, in Romans 3:28, states, Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.922, pp. 101-102; see also Luther M. Amic. Discussion, 1, 127). This passage strongly suggests that Martin Luther viewed his opinions, and not the actual Bible as the primary authority.
