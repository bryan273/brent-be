If you're worried that having sex might hurt your baby, you might be tensing up during lovemaking -- this can also cause cramping. Talk with your doctor about your fears, and try to relax. If you have a low-risk pregnancy, sex and orgasms won't hurt your baby. Cramps during sex usually go away pretty quickly. If they don't, ask your partner to give you a low back rub to help you relax and ease the cramping.
