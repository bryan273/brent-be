A series of earthquakes were registered under Iceland's Katla volcano over the past couple of days. Judging by the depth of some of the earthquakes, fresh magma is making its way upward. There were more than 10 earthquakes in total, including M3.6 at 18:36 UTC on June 20, 2017, the strongest so far.
