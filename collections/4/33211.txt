New Google Doodle Honors Wilbur Scoville, Inventor of the Pepper-Heat Scale. Jan. 22 would be the 151st birthday of Wilbur Scoville, the American pharmacist who devised the standard measurement of a pepper's spiciness. Google is honoring him with an interactive Google Doodle game that lets users tackle heat in a different way â€” by throwing balls of ice cream at anthropomorphic peppers.
