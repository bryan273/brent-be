However, the optimum soil pH for high yields of quality sweet potatoes is 5.8 to 6.0. Apply lime if soil pH is too low. A crop of sweet potatoes utilizes about 110 pounds of nitrogen, 15 pounds of phosphorus, and 150 pounds of potassium per acre from the soil.Based on OSU soil test results, the following amounts of P 2 O 5 (phosphorus) and K 2 O (potassium) are recommended (Table 2).pply lime if soil pH is too low.
