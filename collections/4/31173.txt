When trolling for tuna from 3 to 5 rods may be used. Usually a couple of the feathers or jigs will be trolled father back and the other one or two closer to the boat. Use at least 50 pound test not so much for the size of the fish as getting the fish hooked and to the boat in short order.ishing for each species of tuna is roughly the same so regardless of which tuna species being targeted the same fishing techniques apply. During the early summer months schools of albacore tuna first appear in southern California waters following moderate warm waters and bait fish.
