Fetal heart dopplers can usually detect your baby’s heartbeat after about eight or nine weeks gestation, although it may be faint or inconsistent at that age. By 12 weeks into pregnancy, the doppler should consistently and audibly detect your baby’s heartbeat, allowing you to hear it sooner than you otherwise would.
