The element and its compounds make up 49.2% by mass of the Earthâ€™s crust, and about two-thirds of the human body. There are two key methods used to obtain oxygen gas. The first is by the distillation of liquid air. The second is to pass clean, dry air through a zeolite that absorbs nitrogen and leaves oxygen. A newer method, which gives oxygen of a higher purity, is to pass air over a partially permeable ceramic membrane.
