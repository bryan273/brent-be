Last Person Lyrics. by Jukebox the Ghost & Jenny Owen Youngs on album Jukebox the Ghost & Jenny Owen Youngs. Well you're sitting on a barstool Keeping motionless as you can be Thinking maybe if you're lucky life is like T-Rex The stillness will sweep you away to where it's safe 'Cause you're feeling like yo.
