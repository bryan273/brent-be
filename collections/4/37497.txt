The IRS strives to process all mailed returns within 21 days, with e-filed returns processed even quicker. However, errors or requests for additional information can slow down this process. Also, if you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS expects that refunds will not be received under February 27, 2018, assuming that the tax return has no issues. You can track the status of your refund with the IRS Where's My Refund tracking tool.
