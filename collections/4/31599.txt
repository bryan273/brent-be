One of the first things to try for relief is to make some simple changes in your diet and other everyday habits. You can boil it down to these key ideas: Favor low-fat, high protein foods. For instance, choose a chicken breast (without the skin) instead of pasta with a rich, creamy sauce. Think “more and mini.” Eat more often, as long as you cut back on your portions. Smaller meals are easier on your stomach.
