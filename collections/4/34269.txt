To decide which method of analysis is chosen, consider: a) If the suspected material is heavy fuel, lubricating oil or similar product, choose TOTAL OIL AND GREASE. The method is not specific but the cost is low and the method will include some very heavy, complex fuels that other methods may miss. b) If presence of non-fuel type oils involved (e.g. animal fat) that should be separated from petroleum products, CHOOSE MINERAL OIL & GREASE.
