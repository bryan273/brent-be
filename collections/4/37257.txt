In patients with CKD, the renal cortical echogenicity increases at ultrasound [10]. In addition, the renal cortex often becomes thinned [11]. Often this finding occurs with a normal bipolar renal length and an increase in the relative amount of central sinus fat. To the best of our knowledge, a relationship between renal function and cortical thickness has not been well established at ultrasound.
