Temples: The temples are the thinnest part of the cranium, so a good blow here (one-knuckle punch is ideal) can cause concussion, hemorrhaging, or even death. Do not actually strike a training partner with this move. 3. Temple 2: When this area is hit, the victim may be rendered unconscious, in some cases dead.
