I have been involved with baseball my whole life, first playing and now coaching both LL teams and HS baseball. I am no...w in my 7th year of coaching HS ball, my 3rd at Shadow Mountain. Last year was the 1st year I didn't have a player (not even one game) be lost for academic ineligibility. To see a club baseball team focus on the classroom and healthy lives as much as they do on the diamond really excites me.
