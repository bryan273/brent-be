Refacing is a word that is interchangeable with the term resurfacing, especially when it comes to cabinet makers and professional remodelers. It simply means that the face, meaning the front or visible surfaces are getting a facelift. So in essence, they mean the same thing. Refinishing. The difference to note is the difference between refacing cabinets and refinishing cabinets.
