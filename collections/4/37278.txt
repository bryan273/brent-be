A servant is anyone who works for another individual, the master, with or without pay. The master and servant relationship only arises when the tasks are performed by the servant under the direction and control of the master and are subject to the master's knowledge and consent. A servant is unlike an agent, since the servant has no authority to act in his or her employer's place.
