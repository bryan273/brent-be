Activated charcoal or activated carbon absorbs harmful organic chemicals. One common use for activated charcoal is in water purification systems. About a Â½ inch of activated charcoal goes over the drainage material in a terrarium. Some people mix the charcoal with the drainage material, or opt not to include the activated charcoal at all. The purpose of the charcoal is to eliminate unpleasant odors as well as eliminate toxic chemicals harmful to plants. Another name for sphagnum moss is bog moss. When preparing the terrarium soil, a layer of sphagnum moss covers the activated charcoal layer.
