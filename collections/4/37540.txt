Halibut Fishing Season. Halibut fishing season in BC corresponds with salmon fishing season in BC and runs from May to September. Although halibut do not migrate large distances the way salmon do, the time for halibut fishing is the best in the summer months. This is because halibut generally spend winters in deep waters for spawning and migrate to shallower feeding waters in the summer months.
