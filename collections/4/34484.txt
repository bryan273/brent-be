As a result, soil organic materials become increasingly nutrient rich as decomposition occurs. Cereal straw, for example, is made up of carbon and nitrogen in the ratio of 100:1 when it is added to the soil. As this material decomposes and forms humus, its carbon to nitrogen ratio decreases to 12:1.
