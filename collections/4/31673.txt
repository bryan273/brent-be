Metal Composition of Coin . What does Composition of a coin mean . The composition of a coin means what material was used in physically creating the coin. Though a coin could be made of many materials, most world coins are made of various different types of metal. Copper, zinc, and steel are very common examples of metal used to mint (or produce) coins. Therefore, when one says the composition of a coin, one most likely is referencing the metal composition of a coin, or what metals were used to make the coin. For example, the Lincoln copper penny has a metal composition of 95% copper and 5% zinc. The Wheat cent copper penny is 95% copper with near 5% of zinc and a very minute amount of tin mixed in. The newer Lincoln penny known as a zinc cent is 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper. These are just examples of metal mixtures that are used to create coins or have been used in the past.
