What Eggs Do. The eggs added to a cake mix serve a number of functions. The proteins in the egg provide some of the structure that holds the cake together, while the fats in the yolk make it richer and better-tasting. The fats in the yolk also help soften the texture of the cake, keeping it from becoming chewy.f you wish, you can also make a boxed cake mix entirely without eggs. You can compensate for the loss of flavor by using milk instead of water, but it's not usually necessary. You can make an acceptable cake just by pouring a standard 12 ounces soda into the mix.
