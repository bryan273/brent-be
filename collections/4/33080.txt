As she is a girl, she got white ruffly socks and a white headband. I do love your basic white comfy clothes with fun hat idea – maybe we’ll do that with the next one. We got a cute little outfit (plaid shortalls, blue onesie & a hat that matched the shortalls) for bringing my son home from the hospital.y daughter was so little she came home in a little two piece pink bum outfit ad just recently my son came home in a grey outfit with stars with his name embroidered on his rear. Coming home outfits are very special. My son wore the same outfit his dad did 27 years ago. A yellow snap-up jumper.
