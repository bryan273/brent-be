Depending on the design problem they address, design patterns can be classified in different categories, of which the main categories are: Creational Patterns; Structural Patterns; Behavioral Patterns. Patterns are commonly found in objected-oriented programming languages like C++ or Java.

It is not code reuse, as it usually does not specify code, but code can be easily created from a design pattern.
