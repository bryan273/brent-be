However, an exception is made for the birth of your child. You can claim your baby as a dependent for the tax year as long as the baby was born in that tax year. For example, you could claim your baby on your taxes for 2015 and subsequent years if she was born on Dec. 31, 2015. However, if the baby was born on Jan. 1, 2016 or after, you could only claim her for the 2016 tax year and beyond. In order to claim your baby as a dependent, she needs to have a Social Security number.
