Water your plants until the water is able to seep at least six inches into the ground. This should take approximately one inch of water weekly and can be measured by placing a cup next to the plants and marking a one inch line once the cup is filled to this line. Adjust your sprinklers for the amount of time needed for your plants to receive their weekly allotment.
