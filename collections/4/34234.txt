The way most architects charge for their services is confusing. The traditional method of calculating the fee is based on a percentage of the total construction cost. Here's how it works. An architect charges a standard percentage fee.he architect might as well be speaking Greek. To make fees more understandable, some architects now charge by the hour. It's a method of accounting that most people are familiar with and one that many clients use when billing for their own services. It's possible to combine the hourly and percentage systems.
