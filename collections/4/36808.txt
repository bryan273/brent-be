What are Protease Inhibitors (PIs)? When HIV infects a CD4 cell in a person's body, it copies its own genetic code into the cell's DNA. The CD4 cell is then programmed to make new HIV genetic material and HIV proteins. The proteins must be cut up by the HIV protease—a protein-cutting enzyme—to make functional new HIV particles.
