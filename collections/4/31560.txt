The town of San Juan Bautista is quaint with antique shops and boutiques. While visiting some missions, we spend only an hour or two, we spent most of the afternoon in the town San Jaun Bautista, including the mission, state pank, and shops. I visited again on a rainy Christmas Day while my wife waited in the car.
