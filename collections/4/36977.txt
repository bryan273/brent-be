The first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492â€“1504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as  the Indies .ther European nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and France attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the Dutch Republic.
