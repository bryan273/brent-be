Ned Stark is the prototypical protagonist. He’s a handsome hero who, it just so happens, is one of the first characters we meet in George R.R. Martin’s debut novel in the Song of Ice and Fire series, Game of Thrones. In any other book, or on any other show, Ned would still be roaming around Westeros, doing the Honorable Thing.
