Melatonin is also known as MEL. Melatonin is naturally produced in the body in response to the perception of light. Melatonin has been used to ease insomnia, combat jet lag, protect cells from free-radical damage, boost the immune system, prevent cancer, and extend life. Melatonin has not been evaluated by the FDA for safety, effectiveness, or purity.
