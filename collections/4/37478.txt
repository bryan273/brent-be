The elbow is a synovial hinge joint located between the upper arm and forearm. It is formed by the meeting of three bones: the humerus in the upper arm and the ulna and radius in the lower arm.Like all other hinge joints, the elbow permits movement in one plane, namely the flexion and extension of the forearm relative to the upper arm.wo muscles-the triceps brachii and anconeus-act as the extensors of the forearm. The triceps brachii is a long muscle that runs posterior to the humerus from the scapula to the olecranon of the ulna.
