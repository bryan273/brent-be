Confidence votes 22.9K. I was brought up as a Lutheran, and did my college dissertation on Martin Luther, when I was in the Catholic seminary. One would think that Martin Luther held the Bible to be the final authority in religious matters, but his actions prove otherwise.artin Luther was born in 1483 and he died in 1546. Luther was a German priest and he believed that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of G â€¦ od's grace through faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. 6 people found this useful.
