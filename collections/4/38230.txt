Because of this, cortisol blocks the continued release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and switches off the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is known as a negative feedback loop. Some effects of corticotrophin-releasing hormone in the brain can also be blocked by leptin, a hormone produced by fat tissue.
