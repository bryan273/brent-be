Social networking is really a subcategory of social media. The easiest way to understand the difference between social media and social networking is by thinking about the terms media and networking separately. Media refers to the information you're actually sharingâ€“whether it's a link to an article, a video, an animated GIF, a PDF document, a simple status update or anything else.
