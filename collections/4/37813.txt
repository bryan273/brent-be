Perry Mason and Twilight Zone look best in b&W. It was known by late 1965 that this was going to be Perry Mason's last season.The producers wanted to see how the show would've looked had the show had entered a 10th season as all shows in the fall of 1966 were going to be in color on the networks,At least in prime-time.
