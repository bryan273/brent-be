Considering the fact that white roses often convey a feeling of hope, they can symbolize other new beginnings besides marriage as well. It's also worth noting that honor, admiration and adoration are all linked to white roses, which is why they are frequently seen at a memorial for the departed. White funerary and sympathy arrangements will often include these blossoms as a visual indication of respect, remembrance and spiritual love.
