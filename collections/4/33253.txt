What was the name of the first college football team?   The name of the first team would be up for debate since there had to be two teams to actually play football. Rutgers and Princeton played the first game in 1869. I am no â€¦ t aware that one claims to have organized before the other.When the games were first being played, Rutgers teams were the Queensmen. There must be two teams so that begs the question, which of the two teams involved in the first football game organized first? The game, in 1869 was between Princeton University and the Rutgers University Queensmen.
