This is how I think it should end so don't get mad if it's not like the actual storyline Pat is about to record The Crafting Dead with Jen but gets sucked into the computer. After they appear in Minecraft, they have to finish the series by defeating Evil Jen and The Scepter of Darkness, which keeps Herobrine alive.
