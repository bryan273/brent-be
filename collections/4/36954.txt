1 The Government has conducted an evaluation of D4 based on science, called a screening assessment. 2  The Government of Canada has determined that D4 is harmful to the environment, but is not harmful to human health.3  The Final Screening Assessment Report on D4 was published on January 31, 2009. Silicone polymers are also used in industrial processes (for example, as surfactants in certain pesticide products and as defoamers), in lubricants, cleaning products, sealants, adhesives, waxes, polishes and coatings. 2  D4 is not currently manufactured in Canada; however, it is imported into Canada.
