The bottom of the ocean is a very important place for marine life.Just about 90% of all marine species live at least part of their life associated with the bottom. We call this mode of life 'benthic.' These species can be found in the intertidal, shelf, bathyal, abyssal, and hadal zones.Some species even live under the surface of the bottom of the ocean (called infauna).The bottom of the ocean is a major area of decomposition where organic material is recycled (cells are broken down and nutrients are released by bacteria and fungi).ome species even live under the surface of the bottom of the ocean (called infauna).
