There is no good reason to have a Premier account if you are going to use PayPal for business. The fees are similar to or same as Business but some of the features not available. You don’t need to have a properly registered “business” to have a Business account. It can be a DBA (“doing business as”). You can have several Business accounts (just remember that each one should be linked to a different bank account / credit card). There are no monthly fees for any of the accounts.
