Let’s look at some numbers. The top salary at the Girl Scouts (we’ll assume that is the CEO’s salary for this exercise, although I’ll try to dig up the tax returns to confirm) = $349, 912. Top salary at the Boy Scouts = $916, 027. Yup, you heard that right. The head of the boy scouts is earning three times more than the head of the girl scouts.
