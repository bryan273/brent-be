Basketball sizes vary by age, gender, and level of play. The official size of the basketball used by the NBA is 29.5 inches in circumference. That's the same size used throughout men's college and high school basketball leagues. The WNBA uses a slightly smaller ball, measuring 28.5 inches in circumference. For international play, specifically FIBA, the basketball used is what's called a Molten GL7 for men and Molten GL6 for women.
