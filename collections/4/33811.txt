The crust is made out of lighter rocks such as granite. All of the rocks, streams, mountains, and beaches where we see rocks are all part of the crust. The crust is fairly small when it’s compared to the other layers of the earth. It’s only 3 to 5 miles deep under the oceans and about 25 miles deep on land.
