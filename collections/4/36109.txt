Stupid Cupid you're a real mean guy. I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly. I'm in love and it's a crying shame. And I know that you're the one to blame. Hey hey set me free. Stupid Cupid stop picking on me. I can't do my homework and I can't think straight. I meet him every morning 'bout half past eight.
