The renal cortical thickness was measured in the sagittal plane at the level of the mid kidney as described by Moghazi et al. [11]. The measurement was taken over a medullary pyramid, perpendicular to the capsule as the shortest distance from the base of the medullary pyramid to the renal capsule (Fig. 1).
