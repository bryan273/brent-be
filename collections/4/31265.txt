In the Lake States, sugar maple is found at elevations up to 490 m (1,600 ft)-most commonly on ridges between poorly drained areas and on soil with at least 1 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) to the water table. In northern New England and New York State it grows at elevations up to 760 m (2,500 ft).t does not grow well on dry, shallow soils and is rarely, if ever, found in swamps (30). Sugar maple is soil-site specific in southerly regions but abundant on a wide variety of soils in the northern Lake States. It is mostly found on Spodosols, Alfisols, and Mollisols among the soil orders.
