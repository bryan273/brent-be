By law, the IRS may assess penalties to taxpayers for both failing to file a tax return and for failing to pay taxes they owe by the deadline. Here are eight important points about penalties for filing or paying late. 1  A failure-to-file penalty may apply if you did not file by the tax filing deadline. The failure-to-file penalty is generally more than the failure-to-pay penalty. 2  You should file your tax return on time each year, even if youâ€™re not able to pay all the taxes you owe by the due date.
