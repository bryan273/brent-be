NASA Hulton Archive/Getty Images. It was July 20, 1969 when Neil Armstrong spoke what must be considered the most famous words of the 20th century, one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. This, of course, was the day that men from Earth first set foot on the Moon. It was the culmination of years of research and development, success and failure, and bitter competition from our feared rivals. And it was the words of a 38 year old Neil Armstrong that echo in the annals of history.
