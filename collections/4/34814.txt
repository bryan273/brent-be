Around the 12th week of pregnancy you will normally have a prenatal appointment where your doctor or midwife tries to hear the baby's heart beat. This is typically done with a hand-held Doppler, which is a device that uses ultrasound waves to detect a heartbeat when it is too early to detect it with a stethoscope.
