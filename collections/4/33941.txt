If your files are in .M4P or a protected .AAC format there are two main solutions: either burn the protected m4p songs to an audio CD in iTunes, then extract the CD tracks to .WAV or .AIFF in iTunes; or play the m4p files in iTunes and record them with another recording program and save in mp3 format.f the files are shown as .AAC, they are probably also protected, but not necessarily, so you could first of all try converting them within iTunes to .WAV or .AIFF by right-clicking on the file to choose Convert Selection to WAV/AIFF. Apple's DRM technology encrypted in M4P music is not unbreakable.
