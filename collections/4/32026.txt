The cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells.The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings. It consists of the phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.he cell employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological membranes: 1. Passive osmosis and diffusion: Some substances (small molecules, ions) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxygen (O 2), can move across the plasma membrane by diffusion, which is a passive transport process.
