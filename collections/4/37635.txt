If a sperm containing 46 chromosomes fused with an egg containing 46 chromosomes, how many chromosomes would the resulting fertilized egg contain? Do you think this would create any problems in the developing embryo? 46 + 46 = 92; a developing embryo would not survive if it contained 92 chromosomes.
