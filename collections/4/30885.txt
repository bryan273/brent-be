The largest clade is insect specific, comprising 27 insect Piwi subfamily genes such as DmePIWI and DmeAUB. Insect Ago3 protein is in a separate clade along with vertebrate Piwi proteins, Hili, zili and mili.All vertebrate Piwi proteins except Hili, zili and mili are clustered as an independent clade.IWI domain is of 300 aa in the C-terminal region and structurally similar to RNaseH catalytic domain, which performs a crucial role in slicer activity [6] , [7] and [8] . In animals, Argonaute protein family can be divided into two classes: Ago subfamily and Piwi subfamily.
