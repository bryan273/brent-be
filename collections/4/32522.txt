Recent evidence shows that several pure motor neuropathy syndromes can be distinguished from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Identification of these motor neuropathy syndromes is important as, in contrast to ALS, they are often immune- mediated and treatable. The motor neuropathy syndromes usually have characteristic, but not unique, patterns of weakness and no upper motor neuron signs.
