Averaging about 68 miles wide, the path of the Moon's shadow on August 21, 2017, will cut through or clip 14 states during its 90-minutelong crossing from coast to coast. Everyone in North America outside this central path will see a partial solar eclipse that day. Michael Zeiler / GreatAmericanEclipse.com.
