The appearance of the discharge varies with the cause. Nasal discharge can be clear (serous), gray and cloudy (mucoid), thick and green (purulent), or bloody. The discharge may come from one or both nostrils. Clear (serous) nasal discharge, usually accompanied by sneezing, may be seen in animals with allergies. The discharge usually comes from both nostrils and is intermittent. Often other allergic signs are seen as well, such as scratching, hair loss, face rubbing, and paw licking. Allergies may be seasonal.
