Does anyone know about this particular aspect of Japanese culture called SHIBARI? Although the name sounds voluptuous, it really rings no bell and gives no insight into what it is really on about. After a quick research, it is found that Japanese SHIBARI was developed during the Edo period. Handcuffs were not common at the time so ropes were used to restrain criminals.
