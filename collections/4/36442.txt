Lidocaine, pronounced LYE-doe-kane, is a local or topical anesthetic that can be applied to the skin or to mucous membranes to reduce the immediate feeling of pain and produce numbness. Lidocaine has been in the market since 1948, and is available over the counter, which means no doctor prescription is needed to buy it or use it.
