You hopefully remember that phospholipids are the molecules that make up the plasma membrane. and all of the membranes of a human cell (nuclear membrane, lysosomal membrane, both mitochondrial membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus). They have a polar, hydrophilic head and two non-polar, hydrophobic tails.ou hopefully remember that phospholipids are the molecules that make up the plasma membrane. and all of the membranes of a human cell (nuclear membrane, lysosomal membrane, both mitochondrial membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus).
