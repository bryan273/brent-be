Equilibrioception, or the sense of balance, is a sense by which animals and humans receive information about their external or internal environments. In humans, the sense of balance is mostly maintained by the vestibular system, the sensory system that detects acceleration or changes in movement. Dizziness may be the result of a disturbance of the vestibular system. A significant component of the vestibular system is the labyrinth of the inner ear. Causes of balance disruption can include inner ear infections.
