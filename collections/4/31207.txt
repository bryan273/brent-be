In another bowl, cream 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup white sugar. Add 2 teaspoons baking powder to 1 1/2 cups cake flour, along with a dash of salt. Sift together then add to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the caramelized sugar syrup--first a little flour, then a little syrup, until all have been used.
