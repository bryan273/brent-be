Often, a Z score is used as the test statistic. For example, when using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, an appropriate test statistic is Np q # of successes .5 - Npz = 0 0 ± 0 where p 0 and q 0 are the probabilities of success and failure as implied or stated in the null hypothesis.When the Null hypothesis is true, Z has a N(0,1) distribution.or example, when using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, an appropriate test statistic is Np q # of successes .5 - Npz = 0 0 ± 0 where p 0 and q 0 are the probabilities of success and failure as implied or stated in the null hypothesis. When the Null hypothesis is true, Z has a N(0,1) distribution.
