Warnings. 1  Never run from a coyote. It can run much faster than you. 2  Never try to feed a coyote. Feeding wild animals is illegal in the U.S. and Canada, and could result in injury if the animal were to bite you. 3  Coyotes often attack humans to protect their pup's lives. Take care not to go too close to a coyote pup.
