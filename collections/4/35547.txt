If a disc ruptures and spills its contents into the spinal canal, it can often apply pressure to, or even “pinch,” an adjacent nerve root in the spinal column. An impinged nerve root often produces traveling pain, numbness and tingling along the length of the nerve, whether it goes to an arm and hand or a leg and foot.ciatica is a set of symptoms that might include herniated disc pain and the sensation of sharp pain or “pins and needles” in the buttocks, legs and feet. A pinched nerve caused by a herniated disc in the cervical spine (neck) might be the cause of a burning sensation in the arms or soreness in the shoulders.
