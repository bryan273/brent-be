I had an outfit picked out for her to come home in, but alas she was so tiny (5.12 at birth) that absolutely NOTHING I had fit her. I had a friend bring a preemie outfit to the hospital and even THAT was too big.y daughter was so little she came home in a little two piece pink bum outfit ad just recently my son came home in a grey outfit with stars with his name embroidered on his rear. Coming home outfits are very special. My son wore the same outfit his dad did 27 years ago. A yellow snap-up jumper.
