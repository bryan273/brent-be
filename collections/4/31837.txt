Pack into hot jars leaving 1 inch head space. Add 1/2 tsp salt to pints and 1 tsp to quarts. Fill jars with boiling water, again leaving 1 inch head space. Next be sure and wipe off the rims of your jars. If there is salt or greens sticking to the jar it will interfere with the seal to the canning lid. A quick swipe with a damp paper towel is usually enough for this type of food.
