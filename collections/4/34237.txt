Percentage of construction cost. Architectural fees usually run between 8 and 15 percent of the cost of construction. Thus, on a project that costs $100,000 to build, the architectural fees would fall in the range of $8,000 to $15,000.o often I have new clients question my fees in comparison to other professional architects. Well, I talked to an architect who offered $x.00 dollars less than your offer..... I do not compromise because of the value of our service. I do not negotiate down.
