Observation Versus Interpretation. Another way of appreciating the difference between representational and non-representational art is to see things from the viewpoint of the artist. Representational painters typically act as observers and try to reproduce what they see.f course, they do 'interpret' what they see-hence no two painters will paint a scene in identical fashion-but their primary aim is to observe and reproduce the object(s) in front of them. Thus, for example, plein-air painting-an approach popularized by 19th century Impressionists-is almost always representational.
