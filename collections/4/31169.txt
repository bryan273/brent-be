The first set up is a standard 20-25 pound test rig (depending on the size of the tuna) with a size 1 to 2/0 hook depending on bait size and the size of the tuna. Fluorocarbon leader can be super effective if the fish are touchy (biting infrequently).This set up will be the primary bait fishing set up.ishing for each species of tuna is roughly the same so regardless of which tuna species being targeted the same fishing techniques apply. During the early summer months schools of albacore tuna first appear in southern California waters following moderate warm waters and bait fish.
