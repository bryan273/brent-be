How Many Plays Did Shakespeare Write Altogether? Altogether, Shakespeare wrote 39 plays â€“ if you include the recently attributed Double Falsehood. After many years of research, Arden Shakespeare published this play under the name William Shakespeare in 2010. It will take time for Double Falsehood to be fully incorporated and accepted into the Shakespeare canon, which means that it is generally accepted that Shakespeare wrote 38 plays in total.
