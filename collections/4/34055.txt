Description: “If Loving You Is Wrong” is the new dramatic series created for television by writer/director Tyler Perry, premiering this fall on OWN. “If Loving You Is Wrong” is the compelling story of several women from very different walks of life.t is sad to see such a talented writer and producer such as Tyler Perry exploit cheating and negative relationships with “The Have and Have Nots and now “If Loving You Is Wrong.. I wish his talents will bring humor, positive, and family oriented shows like Meet The Browns and “House of Payne to television.
