The FRIP was originally proposed by the State of Rhode Island in the mid-1990s to increase the capacity of the electrified Northeast Corridor along a twenty-two-mile corridor from Central Falls, Rhode Island, through Providence, to Quonset Point/ Davisville and to increase overhead clearances to allow for the movement of modern rail equipment, thereby enabling development of the State's Quonset Point/Davisville port facilities.
