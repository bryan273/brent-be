Eastwood, 84, and seemingly undimmed by time, arrived at the 87th Academy Awards Sunday night accompanied by Christina Sandera, tapped as his new girlfriend. 1  Although US Weekly reported the new woman in his life last summer, the Oscar ceremony was the first official event the two attended as a couple.
