The ISEE is a standard assessment of skills for each applicant, ranking his or her reasoning and achievement skills among students in the same grade. It enables students to take a single, fair, and reliable test for entrance into top-performing independent schools. The ISEE is used by consortia throughout the U.S. and internationally, and for the City of Bostonâ€™s Exam Schools. It is the most advanced admission test available for independent schools.
