So apparently this mall along with The Galleria Mall are the top two favorites in the Houston area, according to Yelp. I love the fact that they mix high and low end stores to meet the needs of the diverse clientele in the area as well as a variety of stores to meet the needs of all ages. They keep this mall clean. In the food court area I have even seen the floorboards being cleaned.
