2016 tax year standard deduction. The 2016 tax year standard deduction for single taxpayers remains at $6,300. A dependent youth can earn up to that much and not have to file a tax return. If a young person doesn't expect to earn more than the threshold amount, he or she needs to note line 7 when filling out a W-4 at the summer workplace.
