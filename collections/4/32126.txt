We don’t want a guest getting out of the bathtub to a mistake a towel bar for a grab bar. Without knowing more about space requirements in your guest bath my recommendation would be between 30” and 48” above the floor. The low end is the previous standard height for vanities. Some people try to mount towel bars the same height as other horizontal items in the room such as the vanity countertop.
