Some species of fishes have a sperm duct which is either partially or completely separate from the mesonephric duct. In all amniote species the efferent ductules from the testis connect to the mesonephric duct (ductus deferens). The mesonephric duct does not function as the urinary duct in amniotes.ome species of fishes have a sperm duct which is either partially or completely separate from the mesonephric duct.
