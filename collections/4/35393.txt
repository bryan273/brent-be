On a supply cover, the vertical axis shows various price points for the product or industry being depicted. The horizontal axis represents the relative quantity of goods suppliers will produce. To demonstrate the law of supply, a person must increase the supply volume while increasing the price. This requirement dictates that the slope curves upward. Producers in a given industry must compare the opportunity cost of supplying one good against the opportunity cost of supply another.
