My diet is about 60% fat (from nuts, seeds, avocado, salmon, olive oil, dairy) 20-30% protein and 10-20% carbs. My diet is basically veggies (raw and cooked) with some sort of protein (tempeh, beef, chicken, fish, eggs, seeds, nuts). I lost 50 lbs and try to keep active â€“ walks, elliptical, resistance band training.
