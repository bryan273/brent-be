It’s the recognizable mark that represents your restaurant everywhere, from your signage, to your menu, and of course on your website. It should also represent you on social media as well. Make your restaurant’s logo the avatar image on your Facebook page and Twitter profile.f you already have a logo and need help inserting into your website, we do that as part of our Full Setup Service at Restaurant Engine. We’ll even tweak your logo to fit with the background etc.
