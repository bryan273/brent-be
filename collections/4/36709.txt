Best Answer: I got mine removed and when I got home like an hour later my bf kissed me. Not like a make out kiss, but you know like a I'm glad your home kiss. As long as it doesn't hurt it's fine and BTW it doesn't hurt as bad as they make it sound. I'm a dental assistant of 2yrs and extract wisdom teeth everyday. It's ok to give someone a light kiss on the lips right now. But I don't recommend a lot of heavy open mouth kissing. Opening and closing your mouth a lot could pull open the extraction site, causing bleeding.
