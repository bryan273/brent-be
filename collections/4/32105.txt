Definition: Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the p value is the probability of obtaining a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the sample mean actually obtained. A small p value associated with a sample mean indicates a rare occurrence and would lead one reject the null hypothesis.he critical region is the set of z scores that will cause us to reject the null hypothesis. For example if we were doing a two tail test with alpha set at 0.05 the critical region would be determined as shown below.
