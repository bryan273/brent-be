Eden Lake is a great addition to the hoodie horror genre. Out of the UK, it nearly surpasses a film it takes notes from, The Descent. 2008 was a great year for horror, with Martyrs, Deadgirl, Rec, Let the Right One In, The Children, etc... and this is one of the best of that year and since. It's dark, bleak, controversial, and somewhat topical.
