Most of your meats, your potatoes and your pies can survive in the fridge for that length of time. But food can last much longer in freezers. Pies can last one to two months in the freezer while turkeys can last two to three months. And if you love potatoes, youâ€™re in luck. You can keep them frozen for 10 months to a year. But eating the same thing can get boring, so spice it up a little.
