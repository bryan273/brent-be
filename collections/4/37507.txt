YOTEL New York at Times Square. Staff was friendly and helpful. Location is excellent, near Times Square and Theater District. Hotel is fairly new, very clean and well kept. Room was small but layed out so very well that the size was not a problem. Parking is expensive but convenient under the hotel. Did not like lack of a separate commode area with a door, only a glass door separated from rest of bathroom and room area.
