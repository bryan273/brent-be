As it turns out, our detector malfunctioned, but was essentially at the end of it's life anyway. Most Carbon Monoxide detectors are good for 5-7 years and should be replaced after that time frame. Typically, the units have a tag or date stamp on the back to indicate it's age or expiration date. Expired smoke and CO detectors should be recycled, as some contain radioactive material, and all have electronic circuits.
