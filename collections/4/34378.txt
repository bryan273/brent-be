Pain in the toe can arise due to abnormalities or injury to any of the structures in the toe, including skin, nerves, bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues. Toe pain is a fairly common symptom, since our feet are constantly exposed to injury by walking and moving around. Some of the most common causes of toe pain include ingrown toenails, cuts or scrapes, other injuries, blisters, and corns and calluses. Arthritis and infections are additional causes of toe pain.
