What Is Cholesterol Ratio and What Should Yours Be? To find your cholesterol ratio, you divide your total cholesterol number by your HDL, or good, cholesterol number. For example, if your total cholesterol number is 200 and your good cholesterol is 50, your total cholesterol ratio is 4:1. Cholesterol ratio may be used as a monitoring tool by some health care specialists.
