This strategy can be used when an immune response to one part of the virus (or bacteria) is responsible for protection against disease. These vaccines can be given to people with weakened immunity and appear to induce long-lived immunity after three doses.y inactivating the toxin, it no longer causes disease. The diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines are made this way. Another strategy to make a bacterial vaccine is to use part of the sugar coating (or polysaccharide) of the bacteria.
