Most particularly, LEGO has embraced the Indiana Jones trade mark since June 2008, ever since the release of the first LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures. The result was a smashing hit, in part because the developer created an animated cartoonish figure that abides both the LEGO and the Indiana Jones distinct and unique characteristics. The game was a perfect mix of adventure and good old fashioned fun, and also followed the script of the original motion picture.
