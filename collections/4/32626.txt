Pricing. Use RandomPicker for your business activities and pay as you go, no contracts are necessary. We recommend our yearly plan if you need to conduct several drawings. You can also purchase one credit for a separate drawing. Use your credit card or PayPal to pay for RandomPicker. RandomPicker is for free if you choose winners for non-profit purposes (limit 100 entries). We like nonprofits - if you work for a great cause, nonprofit organizations can use RandomPicker for free even with higher limits.
