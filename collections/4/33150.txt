Why are oceans salty but not lakes? As water flows over land it picks up minute amounts of salts from the soil and rocks. This water does not pick up enough to be noticeable, and as it flows into lakes, it also â€¦ flows out without appreciable evaporation. Only when the water reaches the end of its flow does it evaporate leaving the salt behind. As this continues throughout the mellennia, the salt concentration increases.
