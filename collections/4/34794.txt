Coyote populations are now quite high as the coyote has adapted to urban environments and has few predators. Coyotes weigh between 20 and 50 pounds. They live up to 14 years in the wild, and they form strong bonds within their pack. Adult coyotes will remain close by as their pups grow up and take care of them.
