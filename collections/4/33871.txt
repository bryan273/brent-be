KML stands for Keyhole Markup Language. The KML file format was originally developed by Keyhole Inc. for the Keyhole mapping application. The Keyhole company and its software was acquired by Google in 2004. The KML file format is now used primarily by the Google Earth application, although other mapping programs have been known to use this file format as well. KML files use XML format to store geographic modeling information.
