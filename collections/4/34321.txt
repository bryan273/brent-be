My name is Mojtaba. In July 2011, Sudan separated into two countries - Sudan and South Sudan. I live in Sudan, on the outskirts of the capital Khartoum. You can find out more about where I live and the history of this great city from the videos I've been making. You can also find out what young people think about the recent separation of Sudan.
