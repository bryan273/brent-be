Pick a random student in class to answer a question or participate in a classroom activity. That’s right—you in the back, Jimmy! Spin a wheel of questions, topics, or vocabulary terms. This is a great substitute for studying with flash cards, and since the topics shuffle, everyone stays on their toes.
