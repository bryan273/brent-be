The meat used was normally finely chopped -- also known as minced in cooking lingo -- and that's where this pastry got its name. But by the 20th century, beef suet replaced the meat in most mincemeat, and the fruits (such as apples, dried raisins and candied citrus) took center stage -- always with booze like brandy.These days sometimes even the suet is taken out and replaced with butter, making mincemeat a vegetarian-friendly food.incemeat was first created as a way of preserving meat -- usually mutton -- without having to salt or smoke it. It became a Christmas staple when the Crusaders returned home in the 12th century with cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.
