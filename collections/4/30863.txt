The Womenâ€™s Club Basketball team at UC Davis was created to give women of the university an opportunity to play competitive basketball against teams outside of the Davis community. This organization serves to promote the value of teamwork, sportsmanship, and competition while providing a team and family-like atmosphere for all of its members.
