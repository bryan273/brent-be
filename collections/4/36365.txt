Copper has been used to make coins for currency since about 600BC - see The Timeline of Copper. The ancient Romans recognised the value of this material and used a wide variety of copper coins. Centuries later, the Gold Standard gave way to the Copper Standard for coins of all values due to copper's long-lasting properties.
