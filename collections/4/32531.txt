If the test above isolated a possible AFM lifter concern, it will lead to this test, which tests the VLOM (Valve Lifter Oil Manifold) for proper operation. SI states a limited amount of air will leak from the bleed holes and outlet ports even when solenoids are off, and compare the amount of leakage to verify all 4 solenoids are operating the same. If it isolates a concern with the VLOM, replace it and re-evaluate the concern. * If the tests above isolate an AFM concern, or if no rocker/valve movement is noted with the valve cover removed, follow SI repair procedures to replace the pair of lifters for the related cylinder.
