Married couples filing a joint return get to claim two personal exemptions (one for each of you) on the tax return instead of the one exemption allowed when you filed as a single individual. Additionally, the standard deduction allowed on the tax return is highest for married couples filing a joint return. (See exemptions and deductions explained.) For 2014, single taxpayers are allowed a standard deduction of $6,200, while married couples filing a joint return are allowed a deduction of $12,400.
