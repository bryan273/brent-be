So I found out the font. Not the logo's exact one, because that was a modified version of what I have. The font is named FF Mark. It is used for their commercials, game case art, their website, etc. They slightly modify this font too. Here's a comparison: http://imgur.com/a/5z7yQ. This font is not free, and costs quite a lot. They do have one free font.
