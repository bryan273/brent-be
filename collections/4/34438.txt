When the oil or melted butter is hot, add the mushrooms. You should hear a sizzle. If the fat isn't hot enough, the mushrooms will start to water out and steam instead of saute. Cook the mushrooms for 4 to 5 minutes or until tender and lightly browned, stirring occasionally with a heatproof spatula or wooden spoon. For four side-dish servings, start with about 8 ounces (3 cups) sliced mushrooms and 2 tablespoons oil or butter. Tip: Make sure not to crowd the mushrooms in the pan.
