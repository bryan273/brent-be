How do I build a tennis court? So you are thinking of building a tennis court? First thing you should consider is how much land do you have. The minimum size for a tennis court is 15 x 30 metres this will give you two metres from the double side line to the fence and three metres from the back line to the fence. Council approval is usually necessary so you should check with council their requirements as regards set backs and land use ratio.
