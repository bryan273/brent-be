In addition to this part, there is an actuator on top of the steering column that is moved by the key when turned. This actuator is connected to a switch on top of the steering column which you can't see until you let the column down. This actuator sometimes breaks. I suppose the switch it is connected to could also go bad. You can see the actuator move when you turn the key if it is not broken. You look at the gap between the dash and the steering wheel and it will be right on top.
