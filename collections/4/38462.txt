Eschar is an area of dead tissue on the skin. Often called a black wound, the scab may appear black with a thick collection of dry tissue. This tissue is often necrotic, or created as a result of the early death of otherwise healthy skin cells. This condition can be related to burn injuries, spider bites, and gangrene.
