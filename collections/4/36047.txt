The upstream section of the reservoir has predominantly river-like qualities, meaning there is often still some current, and the organisms in this section are usually those found in rivers. As the water moves closer to the dam, the current slows, and the reservoir becomes more lake-like. At this point, many of the sediments and materials carried by the river settle to the bottom of the reservoir. Many of the organisms inhabiting this region of the reservoir are those more typically found in lakes.
