Chloroplasts /ˈklɔːrəˌplæsts, -plɑːsts/ are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (1832–1897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks – sometimes called The Father of Plant Physiology.
