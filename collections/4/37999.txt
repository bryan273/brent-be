If you have not heard of Moo Goo Gai Pan, it’s a popular chicken and mushroom dish commonly found in most Chinese take-outs, Chinese buffets in the Midwest (during my college days), the East Coast, and the Southern states of America. Moo Goo Gai Pan is actually a classic Chinese stir-fry dish. It’s a popular Cantonese version of a simple chicken and mushroom dish stir-fried in a tasty white sauce. In the Cantonese dialect, Moo Goo means mushroom and Gai Pan means chicken slices. Chicken and mushroom are always a great combination.
