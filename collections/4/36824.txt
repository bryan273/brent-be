The most powerful chemical mutagens, which increase the frequency of mutations hundreds of times, are called super-mutagens. Some viruses might also be considered chemical mutagens, since the mutagenic factor in viruses seems to be located in their DNA or RNA. Mutagens are apparently universal, that is, they can cause mutations in all forms of lifeâ€”from viruses and bacteria to the higher plants, animals, and man.
