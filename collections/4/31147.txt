The thermosphere is so hot because sunlight strikes this layer of the atmosphere first.espite the air molecules present, the thermosphere is essentially a vacuum. The International Space Station orbits within the thermosphere, at an altitude of 280 to 460 kilometers (175 to 285 miles). The range of the thermosphere is from about 100 to 600 kilometers (60 to 360 miles) above the Earth's surface.
