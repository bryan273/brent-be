It would not be specifically the walking which strenghtens the heart. It is increase in heart rate which comes from the walking that does it. I often tell me clients that the heart could care less what the form of cardio is, (i.e. bike, treadmill, eliptical, etc.) as long as it gets the heart rate up!
