That printer only gets ink made by Epson now. The time I experienced a problem with a black 920 ink refill not working, I had the HP clean the printheads and that cleared it up. I’ve had all my cartridges refilled at Costco and they have worked every time, I’m having both HP 950 and HP 951 cartridges refilled.
