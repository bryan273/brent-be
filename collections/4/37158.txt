Explain why people with miner's lung have a lower concentration of oxygen in their blood. In healthy lungs, a gradient is maintained between the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli and the concentration of oxygen in the lung capillaries. Describe how ventilation helps to maintain this difference in oxygen concentration.
