STATE OF THE CITY. 2015 was a quietly productive year. This year saw some great improvements in many of our key indicators over the 2014 levels, positive changes in our operations, and continued development of the United for Yuma community message of working stronger together as a community. The main message is positive – things are changing – Yuma is growing again.
