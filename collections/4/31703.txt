The splash zone is commonly covered in encrusting algae and dark lichens that are tolerant of sea spray. Few other marine organisms can tolerate the almost terrestrial conditions found in the splash zone. Below the splash zone is the high intertidal zone, which is exposed to air for a large part of the day.
