Another popular design among Japanese tattoo is carp. In the oriental culture, carp is a symbol of strength and courage. In the Chinese folklore, koi fish swim up the Yellow River but only a few can reach ryumon (竜門/ Longmen or dragon gate). It´s believed that the carps which pass this point become a dragon.
