Inside a Mortuary. I have been asked a few times about what a mortuary is like. Few people have seen a mortuary in person. The only time most of us have any experience with a mortuary or morgue is on TV. I tell people the mortuary isn't really like what is show on TV. But this leaves people with a puzzled look, wondering well, what is it like then? Here are a collection of pictures I took inside a funeral home mortuary. As well as a few videos and other things by others which show a mortuary. The first few pictures were taken by me at a funeral home mortuary in Sydney. Many of the photos will be blurry. They were taken with an iPhone, not a proper camera and taken quickly in poor lighting.
