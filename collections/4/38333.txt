1 The penalty for filing late is normally 5 percent of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late. 2  That penalty starts accruing the day after the tax filing due date and will not exceed 25 percent of your unpaid taxes. The failure-to-file penalty is generally more than the failure-to-pay penalty. 2  You should file your tax return on time each year, even if youâ€™re not able to pay all the taxes you owe by the due date.
