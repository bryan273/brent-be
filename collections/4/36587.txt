In each of sections concerning the student's and the parents' financial information, the FAFSA asks you to report your and/or your parents' total income tax liability for the most recent tax year. On the Federal Form 1040 you can find your total federal income tax, which is what you need to report on the FAFSA to answer the income tax question. If you haven't completed your federal return as of the date you're filing the FAFSA, you can use an estimated figure by looking at your return for the most recent tax year you have on record.
