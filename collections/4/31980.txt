Examine your financial and marital situation to determine whether to file taxes jointly or separately. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows you to file jointly if you and your spouse are legally married on the last day of the tax year or living together in a state that recognizes common law marriage. Generally, filing jointly gives the most tax savings.
