You have two adrenal glands. They’re located on top of each of your kidneys. They’re part of your endocrine system, a collection of glands that produce hormones. While they’re small in size, your adrenal glands are responsible for numerous hormone-related functions in your body. As a result, disorders that affect your adrenal glands can have a broad impact on your health. If you suspect that you have an adrenal disorder, talk to your doctor.
