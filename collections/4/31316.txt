The insurance coverage the NCUA provides through the NCUSIF is practically the same as the FDIC. Individual accounts are protected up to $250,000. One difference with NCUA insurance, though, is that it covers regular shares and share draft accounts, which are specific to credit unions and do not exist at banks.
