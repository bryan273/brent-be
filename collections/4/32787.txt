The immune system is made up of specialized cells and proteins. Some of these specialized cells include white blood cells such as lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) and phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages). White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. The complement system is a group of proteins found in the blood that are critical in defense against infection. When the immune system is missing any of these parts, people are vulnerable to specific types of diseases.
