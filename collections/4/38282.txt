A low blood sugar under 70 mg/dL in both non-diabetics and diabetics can be very dangerous. Low blood sugar causes shakiness, confusion, loss of coordination, and if low enough, can lead to a coma. A high blood sugar reading over 180 mg/dL are rare and can indicate pre-diabetes, type 1, and type 2 diabetes. In the short run, high blood sugar levels can causes excessive hunger, thirst, urination, and dehydration, but consistently elevated blood sugars over a long period of time can lead to other diseases such as kidney failure and amputations, warns the American Diabetes Association.
