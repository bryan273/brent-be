List of JVM languages. This list of JVM Languages comprises notable computer programming languages that are used to produce software that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Some of these languages are interpreted by a Java program, and some are compiled to Java bytecode and JIT-compiled during execution as regular Java programs to improve performance. The JVM was initially designed to support only the Java programming language.
