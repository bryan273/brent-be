Even when using an invasive catheter to record arterial blood pressure, we use a stethoscope to evaluate the accuracy of the recording on the monitor when we re-calibrate the transducer each shift or every 4 hours. We also use a stethoscope to listen for various sounds over the abdomen as well as lung sounds. We identify the type of sounds and their location and realte to other findings. 1.3k Views · 8 Upvotes · 7 Upvotes
