Tencha (literally translates as ground tea, 碾 茶) is a type of Japanese green tea that is mostly used to make matcha. Tencha is a high quality green tea since the cultivation process is the same as for gyokuro. Tencha’s main characteristic is that it comes in small, dark green flakes. Why then, does tencha mean ground tea in Japanese? Because tencha must be ground to make matcha. How is tencha made? Tencha is cultivated in the same way as gyokuro. The tea leaves are shaded for at least 20 days before being harvested.
