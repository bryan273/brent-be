Tuna fishing usually begins sometime in June with albacore tuna and bluefin tuna usually first appearing in our waters. During warmer water years yellowfin tuna can also be caught at this time. Fishing for each species of tuna is roughly the same so regardless of which tuna species being targeted the same fishing.hese techniques hold true for all species of tuna with the chasing porpoise technique reserved just for yellowfin tuna. Fishing for tuna in general is punctuated by relatively calm relaxed periods that can suddenly change within a second to wide open biting tuna.
