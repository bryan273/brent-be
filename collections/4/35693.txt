Recombinant DNAs are molecules of DNA that are formed through genetic recombination methods. DNA molecules from two or more different sources are cleaved using restriction enzymes and then joined together using ligases. Recombinant DNA is possible since the fundamental chemical structure of DNA molecules is the same in most organisms. The DNA fragments may come from any species. Thus, recombinant DNA is sometimes referred to as chimeric DNA due to the DNA resulting from the recombination of DNA fragments from two different species, likened to a chimera. An example of this is a plant DNA that is joined to a bacterial DNA.
