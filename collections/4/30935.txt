The Satan then afflicts Job with a skin disease (often mistranslated leprosy, but not the bacterial leprosy that we know today), and three friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar) come to comfort him. DIALOG The middle section of Job is in poetry, not prose. In Chapter 3, Job laments his fate, says that he cannot stand the burdens of life and wishes he were dead. For the next 25 chapters, there is a pattern or cycle: each of the three friends makes a speech, and Job responds.
