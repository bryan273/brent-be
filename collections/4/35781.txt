The British military system served as a model for our Army. British Pilgrims from the Massachusetts Bay Colony created the first militias.. In December 1636 they had formed the first three regiments of a permanently organized militia. These units; the north, south, and east regiment, still exist today in the form of the 181st and 182nd Infantry, the 101st Field Artillery, and 101st Engineer Battalion, Massachusetts National Guard.
