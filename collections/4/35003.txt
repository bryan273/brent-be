Instructions. Slice your spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to remove all the seeds from the squash flesh and set them aside. Transfer the seeds to a colander and rinse them under cold water to remove any flesh that is stuck to the seeds. Dab the seeds dry with a paper towel. Set your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the dried seeds into a large bowl and add 1 tsp. olive or vegetable oil, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper. Stir the spaghetti squash seeds until they are evenly covered with the oil, salt and pepper. Pour them onto a baking sheet and spread them out in an even layer. Place the baking sheet into the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the seeds from the oven and stir them, then place them back into the oven.
