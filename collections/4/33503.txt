The inside of the drums and the rotor surface is bare metal and will rust quickly. Some brake pads and shoes are semi-metallic and can get some rust on them. On my Neon and Shadow, the rear brakes will rust when it is damp and squeal like mad. They are also very grabby and it is easy to slide a rear wheel. The Shadow had a bad timing belt and had been sitting for a while, outside. The rotors were completely rusted. I rode the brakes for a few feet and they cleared up.
