1) Dry-salting = meat or fish is buried in granular salt 2) brine-curing = meat is put in a strong salt-water. Since salt was fairly expensive, generally only meats high in fat would be preserved. Mutton wasn't preserved as often since the meat is usually tough and string and was literally 'not worth its salt'.
