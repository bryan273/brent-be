Remove steaks and burgers from the heat when the thermometer registers 5°F lower than the desired doneness, and roasts 5-10°F lower, as the temperature will continue to rise while resting. The USDA recommends steaks and roasts be cooked to 145°F (medium) and then rested for at least 3 minutes.To ensure food safety, ground beef should be cooked to a minimum 160°F (well done). Be sure to check with a thermometer, as color alone is not a foolproof indicator.ooking times and temperatures may vary with the method of preparation, the size and shape of the Certified Angus Beef ® brand cut and the desired degree of doneness. Test steaks, roasts and burgers for doneness using a meat thermometer or instant-read thermometer.
