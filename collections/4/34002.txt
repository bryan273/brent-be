Different cargos face different threats; therefore armored trucks require different protection. All of this is taken into account before designers start their work. Using armor of stainless steel, we provide our customers a virtual lifetime body that won't wear out and can be remounted on a new chassis several times. Using armor of aluminum, we provide our customers with the opportunity of higher payloads reducing the overall gross weight of our armored trucks.
