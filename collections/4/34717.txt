On the venule end of the capillary bed, blood pressure in the vessel is less than the osmotic pressure of the blood in the vessel. The net result is that fluid, carbon dioxide and wastes are drawn from the body tissue into the capillary vessel. Blood Vessels. Arteries - transport blood away from the heart. Veins - transport blood to the heart. Capillary - transport blood from arteries to the veins. Sinusoids - vessels found in certain organs including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
