D. The other hypothesis, which is assumed to be true when the null hypothesis is false, is referred to as the alternative hypothesis, and is often symbolized by H A or H 1. Both the null and alternative hypothesis should be stated before any statistical test of significance is conducted.or example, when using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, an appropriate test statistic is Np q # of successes .5 - Npz = 0 0 Â± 0 where p 0 and q 0 are the probabilities of success and failure as implied or stated in the null hypothesis. When the Null hypothesis is true, Z has a N(0,1) distribution.
