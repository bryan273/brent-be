You may recall that we bemoaned the $1,699 starting price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina when we reviewed it in November. Now the 128GB version will start at $1,499, and $1,699 will buy you the version with a faster 2.6GHz processor and 256GB of storage. Apple's also dropping the price of the 256GB 13-inch MacBook Air to $1,399 from $1,499.
