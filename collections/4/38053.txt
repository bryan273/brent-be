Before it was over the Peshtigo Fire alone had caused more deaths and destroyed more property, than any single fire in United States history. Possibly as many as 2,500 people died and 1.2 million acres were left barren. The town of Peshtigo itself was completely destroyed, thus lending its name to the historic fire. The Peshtigo Fire produced 8 times the number of deaths and burned 500,000 times the area as the Chicago Fire did, but yet it remains virtually unknown to most people outside of Wisconsin. Peshtigo is located just to the west of the Bay of Green Bay.
