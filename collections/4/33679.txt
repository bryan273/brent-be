Legionaries signed up for at least 25 years' service. But if they survived their time, they were rewarded with a gift of land they could farm. Old soldiers often retired together in military towns, called ‘colonia’. An auxiliary was a soldier who was not a Roman citizen. He was only paid a third of a legionary’s wage.
