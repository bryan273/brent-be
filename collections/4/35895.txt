All of this can take days to happen. With the flu in particular, the time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually between one and four days. So, when are you most contagious? Most experts agree that adults with a cold or the flu start being contagious about a day before they start experiencing symptoms. For the flu, the contagious period then lasts five to seven days into the illness.
