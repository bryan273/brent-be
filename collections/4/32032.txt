For germination, it is soil temps that is important, not the air temp. Soil temps are normally 10-20 degrees lower than the ambient air temps. For example, pepper seeds germinate best in soil temps of 80-85 degrees. You cannot warm your soil to that temp without a heat source.So to obtain the best results, the use of heating mats, or at least some source of supplemental heat, for germination is normally recommended for indoor seed starting.
