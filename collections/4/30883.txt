Ras is a G protein, or a guanosine-nucleotide-binding protein. Specifically, it is a single-subunit small GTPase, which is related in structure to the G Î± subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with on and off states.he two switch motifs, G2 and G3 are the main parts of the protein that move upon activation by GTP. This change in the conformation of the two switch motifs is what mediates the basic functionality as a molecular switch protein. This GTP bound state of Ras is On-state and GDP bound state is the Off-state.
