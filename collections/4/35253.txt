Your kneecap (patella) also needs to glide properly in the “knee groove” for the joint to function normally. Patella malalignment or instability can often feel like your knee cap is slipping or dislocating out of the natural groove of the knee. Sometimes, people are born with abnormal alignment or have a knee groove that is too shallow, allowing the kneecap to dislocate. In other cases, patella malalignment can also be caused by trauma or from overuse. Patellar realignment surgery brings the kneecap back into normal alignment.
