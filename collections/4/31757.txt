An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves in front of the Sun but does not cover the Sun's discs completely. Â©iStockphoto.com/peisen zhao. In an annular eclipse of the Sun, the Moon casts its antumbra-the outer part of the Moon's umbra-on the Earth. Like total solar eclipses, annular solar eclipses can also be seen as partial eclipses from locations outside the Moon's antumbra but inside its penumbra.
