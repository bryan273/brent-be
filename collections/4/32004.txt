BEGINNER'S PROJECT GLOSSARY. Note: Almost all of the words in this list are taken directly from the Beginners pages (yes, I actually read through the entire thing!). I have also thrown in a few words that I think you will need to know (or be able to find a definition for). I have assumed that nothing RR related is too obvious to be defined.
