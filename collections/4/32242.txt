One word about the summer in Georgia: HOT. Highs average in the mid-to upper 80s through July, and will regularly top out in the low 90s in August. On a very hot, high-pressure summer day with little wind, temperatures along the coast may push more than 100 degrees.urthermore, the one thing Georgia does have going for it is a 6- to 10-foot difference between tides. Since the coast here is sort of tucked back west of the Carolinas and Florida, the tide pushes into the Georgia Bight with more force than anywhere south of Maine.
