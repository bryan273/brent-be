The cell membrane consists of three classes of amphipathic lipids: phospholipids, glycolipids, and sterols. The amount of each depends upon the type of cell, but in the majority of cases phospholipids are the most abundant.In RBC studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid.he cell employs a number of transport mechanisms that involve biological membranes: 1. Passive osmosis and diffusion: Some substances (small molecules, ions) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) and oxygen (O 2), can move across the plasma membrane by diffusion, which is a passive transport process.
