When you just click on your network, all that does is turn it off then turn it on again. It doesn't change the settings. Also when you turn find devices off that turns off all of the WiFi networks so that's no good. On Windows 8.1 you can just click on the network to change it to Private or Public but not on Windows 10. have installed Windows 10 Tech Preview Build 9879 but find there is no way to change the network from Public To Private. As you can see from my screenshots when I clock on the WiFi Icon it does not do anything. Also there is no way to change it in the network and sharing center.
