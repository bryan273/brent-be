What We Like. You get a pen in the box, expandable storage is standard. I gotta put this front and center: Samsung's Tab has Apple beat in two crucial ways. Not only is the Tab S3 the same price as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it also includes Samsung's excellent S-Pen with the tablet for no extra cost. Recall that the vaunted Apple Pencil is a $100 extra, so it’s really difficult to grab an iPad Pro that’s doodle-ready for less than $700.
