Phospholipids are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic.The structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of two hydrophobic fatty acid tails and a hydrophilic head consisting of a phosphate group.The two components are joined together by a glycerol molecule. The phosphate groups can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline.hey can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic.
