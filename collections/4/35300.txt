When you build the database project, all included scripts are merged into the build script. By default, your database project contains an empty pre-deployment script and an empty post-deployment script. These scripts are named script.predeployment.sql and script.postdeployment.sql. You designate a pre-deployment script by setting the Build Action property of the script file to PreDeploy.
