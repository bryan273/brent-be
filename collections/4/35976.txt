Earlier this week, Burger King—the corporation, not that guy in the creepy plastic mask from their commercials— unveiled a new lower-fat French fry. Low­­­­­ er-fat, not low-fat. Just pointing that out. Satisfries are crinkle-cut fries coated in a thin layer of batter that absorbs less oil, B.K. says. A small serving contain 270 calories and 11 grams of fat, versus the regular fries' 340 calories and 15 grams of fat.
