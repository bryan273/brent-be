Iron is an essential mineral found in our diet and is part of hemoglobin. You need iron to make new red blood cells to replace the ones lost in a blood donation. Low iron may cause anemia or make it worse.he amount of iron you need will depend on your age, gender, body type, genetics – and how often you donate blood. You can boost your iron level by eating foods rich in iron, eating foods that increase your body’s ability to absorb iron and avoiding substances that block iron absorption.
