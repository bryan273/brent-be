Bandler and Grinder also propose that ostensibly metaphorical or figurative language indicates a reference to a representational system such that it is actually literal. For example, the comment I see what you're saying is taken to indicate a visual representation.he central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses. According to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems.
