This charming riverside village on the banks of the Musconetcong River slipped into the twentieth century with little changed since its settlement in 1800. In 1880, the town was comprised of a store, hotel, cabinet manufacturer, blacksmith, wheelwright shop, grist mill, school house and about 25 dwellings. Hampton was once known as Junction because the New Jersey Central and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroads crossed through here.
