While the trichromatic theory makes clear some of the processes involved in how we see color, it does not explain all aspects of color vision. The opponent-process theory of color vision was developed by Ewald Hering, who noted that there are some color combinations that people simply never see. For example, while we often see greenish-blue or blueish-reds, we do not see reddish-green or yellowish-blue.
