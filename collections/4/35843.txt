Follow your heart and listen to your body. Your heart rate can tell you when you're working hard enough to increase your aerobic fitness. Your body lets you know how hard you are working: If it feels like too much to you, you're probably pushing too hard. Exercise physiologists have figured out a heart rate range that is safe for most people during exercise. They call this your target heart rate range.
