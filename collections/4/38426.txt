There is some scientific evidence that melatonin might improve alertness in people with jet lag. But it doesn't seem to be as useful for other jet lag symptoms such as daytime sleepiness. Melatonin might also be helpful for insomnia for some people. There is also some evidence that melatonin might improve the effectiveness of cancer drugs used to fight tumors in the breast, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach and colon. But it should only be used for this purpose with the help of a healthcare professional.
