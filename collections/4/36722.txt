Differentiation is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a function f(x) of a variable x is a measure of the rate at which the value of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable. It is called the derivative of f with respect to x.he total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case. This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.
