Blood cells are constantly formed through a process called hematopoiesis (also called hemopoiesis). The hematopoietic stem cells —those that give rise to blood cells—originate in the yolk sac of the human embryo and then migrate to the liver.Hematopoiesis thus occurs in the liver of the fetus.ymphoid tissue includes the lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, and thymus. The bone marrow produces all of the different types of blood cells; the lymphoid tissue produces lymphocytes derived from cells that originated in the bone marrow. Hematopoiesis begins the same way in both myeloid and lymphoid tissue.
