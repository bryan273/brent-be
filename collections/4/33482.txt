A target market is a group of customers within a business's serviceable available market that the business has decided to aim its marketing efforts towards. Target markets consist of consumers who exhibit similar characteristics and are considered most likely to buy a business's product or service. Primary target markets are those market segments to which marketing efforts are primarily directed, while secondary markets are smaller or less vital to a product's success.
