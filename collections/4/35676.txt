The dura mater surrounds and supports the large venous channels (dural sinuses) carrying blood from the brain toward the heart. The <b>dura mater</b> [Latin: 'tough mother'] (also rarely called <i>meninx fibrosa</i> or <i>pachymeninx</i>) is a thick, durable membrane, closest to the skull. It consists of two layers, the periosteal layer which lies closest to the calvaria, and the inner meningeal layer which lies closer to the brain.
