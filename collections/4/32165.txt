As a prospective poodle owner, I'd like to know roughly how much it costs monthly/annually to own a poodle (excluding the initial cost). Has anyone calculated how much you spend on your dog monthly/annually? Say, food, vet, toys, treats, insurance, grooming, etc? I know it depends on what you feed, how often you groom, the size of the dog, etc.
