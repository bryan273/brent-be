Since a lipid molecule contains regions that are both polar and nonpolar, they are called amphipathic molecules. Figure %: Basic Lipid Structure. The most abundant class of lipid molecule found in cell membranes is the phospholipid.The phospholipid molecule's polar head group contains a phosphate group.ipids are fats, like oil, that are insoluble in water. There are two important regions of a lipid that provide the structure of the lipid bilayer. Each lipid molecule contains a hydrophilic region, also called a polar head region, and a hydrophobic, or nonpolar tail region.
