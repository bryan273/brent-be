Here are the reasons I CANNOT STAND homework. I am in the 8th grade and homework is my number 1 stress of school. There is not enough time to get it all done. I spend 1-3 plus hours a day doing homework. I do not understand how we can spend time with family, have some free time to eat or play a video game, or do anything really.
