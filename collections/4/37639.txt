At first the cells have the same number of chromosomes as mitosis. DNA replication occurs, giving a total of 46 chromosomes (or 23 chromosome pairs) and 92 chromatids (or 46 chromatid pairs). Meiosis I: In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes separate. In this case, the pairs of sister chromatids are still attached to each other.
