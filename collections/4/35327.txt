One thought on â€œ Animals in Captivity: Do Zoos Actually Educate Visitors? Martin Anthony Lazzaro November 29, 2015 at 2:48 am Although the study may be valid in concluding that 62% children on a trip to the zoo are not more educated on animals after leaving, I do not think it gives reason to shut down zoos. What about the other 38%? Those may become educated and fascinated by animals and go on to do great things for the animal kingdom.
