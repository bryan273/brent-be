Hee Haw - When I moved to Tennessee from NY I was 12 and I assumed that all Southerners were like what I saw on this show. HEE HAW with Buck Owns, Roy Clark, Archie Campbell, Minnie Pearl, Junior Sample, Lulu and the whole HEE HAW Gang!!!! Hee Haw! My Granddaddy and I would watch this every Saturday night.
