Mespilus germanica was a very popular fruit in Western Europe during the Victorian era, but has fallen out of favour there. The medlar is referenced in William Shakespeare's comedy, As You Like It, Act III, scene ii, lines 117-120 in an engaging repartee between Rosalind and Touchstone, the Fool.he genus Eriobotrya was once considered to be closely related to Mespilus. The loquat, one of several Eriobotrya species, was formerly thought to be closely related to the genus Mespilus, and is still sometimes known in some European countries as a medlar and is still sometimes called the Japanese Medlar.
