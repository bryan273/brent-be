The Zone Diet was developed by Dr. Barry Sears more than 30 years ago to reduce diet-induced inflammation. However, its anti-inflammatory benefits can be enhanced by supplementation with anti-inflammatory supplements.he Zone is a real physiological state in your body that can be measured in clinical tests that are routinely used at Harvard Medical School. If you are in the Zone, you have optimized your ability to control diet-induced inflammation. This type of inflammation is the reason you gain weight, become sick, and age faster.
