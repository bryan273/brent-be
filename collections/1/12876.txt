The 2017 Honda Rebel 500 was built for the urban jungle, with soft suspension, light weight and ripe-for-customization style. If you’ve taken the Motorcycle Safety Foundation’s Basic RiderCourse (as well as many other learn-to-ride courses), chances are very good that you did so on a Honda Rebel. Since 1985, the little Rebel 250 has provided a friendly, affordable introduction to the world of motorcycling, and in those 32 years it didn’t really change much, basically looking like a scaled-down version of a full-size cruiser.
