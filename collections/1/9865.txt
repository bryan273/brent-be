The lip color is a lead and wax free liquid formulation that molecularly bonds to the skin and contains titanium dioxide which shields the sun, making it a great sunscreen/lipstick combination. I totally geek out on cosmetics, so I did some of my own research on both the LipSense ingredients and product wear. I have yet to see a lip color out there that compares to the long lasting (water & smudge proof) wear like LipSense.
