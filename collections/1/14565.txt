Tire width is the width of the tire measured in mm from sidewall to sidewall. This tire width is 215 mm. Aspect ratio is the ratio of the height of the tire's cross-section to its width. On our example, 60 means that the height is equal to 60% of the tire's width. Construction tells you how the layers of the tire were put together. R stands for radial, which means the layers run radially across the tire.
