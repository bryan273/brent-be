Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that offers pseudonymity to its users. Although a Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it's becoming an increasingly popular form of digital currency, attracting venture capitalist attention, from Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures to the Winklevoss twins. There is a limited supply of Bitcoins, 21 million in total, with 11 million currently in circulation. While Bitcoin allows you to keep your identity concealed, the block chain acts as a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction.
