1 doctor agreed: Warm salt water : Plica fimbriata are the fringe-like folds of mucosa on underside of the tongue on either side of the frenulum. Sometimes they become enlarged if the toothbrush hits them during brushing. Usually rinsing with warm salt water for 2-3 days helps. Brush your teeth and gums gently.
