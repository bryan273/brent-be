Hoping to go to sorrento for rougly 8 nights in early september. We're hoping to go from the 4th to the 12th Sept. Does anyone know what kind of weather / temperature we can expect for this time of year? Would it be shorts and tshirts weather or would you need to pack a few trousers and jumpers? Thanks in advance.
