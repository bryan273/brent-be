I'm new to the Apple community and because of that I have got a few questions about the battery and the way of charging it: 1.At what percentage should I start to charge the battery ? (Is it a good idea to charge it when there are 10% left?) 10 -20%. 2.At what percentage should I stop charging it ? (100% or below ?
