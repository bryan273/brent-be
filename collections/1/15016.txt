Race, tribe and caste are generally understood to be quite inflexible. Anthropologists have argued that this inflexibility stems from the repetition of custom and ritual, often backed by the state, that creates an ideology of their inflexibility and salience (Mafeje, 1971; Mamdani, 1996; Dirks, 2001).ribe, race, caste or religion could be the more important basis for ethnic identification. In India, on the whole, religion has been a stronger determinant of group identity than language. In Nigeriaâ€™s Yorubaland, tribe has been more salient than religion or language (Laitin, 1986).
