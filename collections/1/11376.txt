The Mesozoic Era. The Mesozoic Era is divided into three time periods: the Triassic (251-199.6 million years ago), the Jurassic (199.6-145.5 million years ago), and the Cretaceous (145.5-65.5 million years ago).*. Mesozoic means middle animals, and is the time during which the world fauna changed drastically from that which had been seen in the Paleozoic.
