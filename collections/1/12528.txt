Spratt derives either from the Old English sprit meaning a  slender person or from esprit meaning an elf. Like many Anglo-Saxon names it originated as a nickname before becoming a surname in the modern sense. The earliest records of the name come from the English counties of Dorset, Somerset and Essex.
