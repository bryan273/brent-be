These two drugs are similar, but NOT the same. Hydrocodone is the generic name for Vicodin, Norco, Lortab and about 30 others. It is a narcotic analgesic, and not quite as strong as Oxycodone. It's also SLIGHTLY less regulated i.e. it can be CALLED IN to a pharmacy by a physician. It can be habit forming.
