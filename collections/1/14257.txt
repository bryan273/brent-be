Your Pastor Needs YOU! Sep 23, 2013 | Dave Kraft. We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves (1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13).et me say it again, Your pastor needs YOU!. Most pastors want to be relevant to the younger generation and know that they can positively influence them for the kingdom. He needs your support, prayers, honest feedback and involvement to do this well.
