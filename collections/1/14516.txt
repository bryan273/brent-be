John Trumbull and his paintings traveled aboard a steamboat to New Haven on September 27, 1832, so that Trumbull could personally direct the hanging of his works. When Trumbull’s wife Sarah died in 1834, Trumbull had her body interred beneath the Gallery and Trumbull himself was buried there in 1843. When Yale opened its new gallery in 1869 and then the present Yale Art Gallery in 1928, the Trumbulls’ remains were reinterred so that John might lie beneath his pictures.
