Definition: An angle whose measure is less than 90°. Try this Adjust the angle below by dragging an orange dot and see how the angle ∠ABC behaves. Note that it is acute for all angles from zero to (but not including) 90°. Acute angles are the smallest, being between (but not including) zero and 90° Note also that acute triangles are those where all the interior angles are acute. A way to remember Sometimes we can confuse acute and obtuse angles. A way to remember is that small things tend to be cute. Acute angle is the smallest type. Types of angle
