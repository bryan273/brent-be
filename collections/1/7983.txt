Trauma is more severe than being in the ER, from what I understand. I mean, most of the people in the ER are awake and can talk, they seem okay for the most part (from what can be seen.). But the patients in trauma are beyond ill. Most of the patients that end up in trauma where I am at are severe car accidents, gun shots, stabbings... just brutal injuries.
