A knee cyst is a small growth filled with joint fluid that extends to the back of the knee. Also called a Baker's or popliteal cyst, it normally forms in response to arthritis or a cartilage injury. Though most are not very serious, they do sometimes cause pain, and must be diagnosed by a healthcare professional.
