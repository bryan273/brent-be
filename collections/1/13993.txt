ASCAP's title, holiday songs, might just be a better term than Christmas songs, although most people would probably refer to these popular tunes (like White Christmas or Let it Snow) as Christmas songs.. Six years ago I was editing a site on famous Jews when I first saw the annual ASCAP holiday song list.
