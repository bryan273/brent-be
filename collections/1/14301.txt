BOJ stands pat, Kuroda rules out 'helicopter money' policy. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) left monetary policy steady on Thursday, surprising several market players who were widely expecting a hefty dose of stimulus. The central bank maintained its negative 0.1 percent deposit rate and its 80 trillion yen base money target. However, it did leave the door open to additional easing steps and said it will provide loans at zero interest rates to areas impacted by the recent Kyushu earthquakes.
