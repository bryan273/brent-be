The gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is assigned by the vehicle manufacturer or finisher. Please note that the GVWR on your DMV paperwork may not be accurate, and should not be reported. The GVWR required for the regulation represents the maximum weight of the vehicle and what it can carry when fully loaded.
