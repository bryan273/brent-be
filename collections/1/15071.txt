The submachine guns being used by most of the Dirty Dozen is the M3, .45 ACP=cal. submachine gun known as the Grease Gun. It came into use late in the war, replacing Thompson submachine guns (aka Tommy guns). It was not a general-issue weapon to infantrymen but normally used as the crew weapon on a tank.
