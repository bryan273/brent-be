We want you to be sure to understand when to use the formula. $$\bar{x} \pm z (\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$$. Often in statistics classes, people get incorrect answers because they were confused about which formula to use. We use the above formula. when we are calculating a confidence interval for a mean, not for a proportion.hen we calculate a z-score, we want to look at how many standard deviations away from the mean our data point falls. A confidence interval relies on a similar principle. We want to estimate how many standard errors our sample mean falls from the true population mean on the sampling distribution.
