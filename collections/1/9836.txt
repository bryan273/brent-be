Use anti-antiperspirant lotions if you sweat excessively. These lotions contain aluminium chloride and should be used in the underarms, palms and soles at night. They work on reducing the amount of sweat. Deodorants do not prevent or control the amount you sweat, but they help to mask the body odour.
