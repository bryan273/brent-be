When you look back at what prompted stock splits from Boeing, the company seemed to be slightly more aggressive than many of its peers in implementing splits to keep share prices down. Just about as soon as the stock climbed above the $100 per share mark in the mid-1990s, Boeing started looking at doing a 2-for-1 split. Previous moves to do less transformative 3-for-2 splits came at even lower share prices, with the $50 per share mark seeming to be a sweet spot that Boeing targeted for its post-split level in the 1980s. Earlier still, Boeing implemented stock splits at even lower price levels. Splitting shares more frequently made sense in the 20th century.
