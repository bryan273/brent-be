BREAKING DOWN 'IOU'. The informal nature of an IOU means that there may be some uncertainty about whether it is a binding contract, and the legal remedies available to the lender, as opposed to formal contracts like a promissory note or bond indenture.Because of this uncertainty, an IOU is generally not a negotiable instrument.OU is an abbreviation, in phonetic terms, of I owe you.. The debt owed does not necessarily involve a monetary value but can also involve other products. With IOUs being informal, those issuing the IOU are given free reign when writing and issuing an IOU.
