As you'd expect, installing the modules is no different than for any other RAM except damn, 16GB a piece! Proof: Even though Intel spec's the max RAM in its latest NUC as 16GB, you can indeed get to 32GB of RAM using Intelligent Memory's new 16GB modules. Once I put the modules in place, I also decided to hot-rod the NUC a little more by using Samsung's XP941 M.2 PCIe module in it.
