\nevery teardrop that you've cried. \nAnd if he ever leaves you blue. \nJust remember, I love you. \nAnd I'll be there before the next teardrop falls. \nAnd I'll be there before the next teardrop falls. If he brings you happiness. \nThen i wish you all the best, \nIt's your happiness that matters most of all. \nBut if he ever breaks your heart, \nIf the teardrops ever start. \nI'll be there before the next teardrop falls.
