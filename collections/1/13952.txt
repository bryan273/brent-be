Poppy straw is the dried mature plant except the seeds, harvested by mowing. Opiates such as morphine, thebaine, codeine, and oripavine are extracted from both the opium and the straw. The seeds themselves contain very small amounts of opiates, and have no measurable narcotic effect in small quantities.
