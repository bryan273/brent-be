In a longitudinal wave, such as a sound wave, the particles oscillate along the direction of motion of the wave. Surface waves, such as water waves, are generally a combination of a transverse and a longitudinal wave. The particles on the surface of the water travel in circular paths as a wave moves across the surface.
