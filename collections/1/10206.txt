[edit on Wikidata] The gastric folds (or gastric rugae) may be seen during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or in radiological studies. They provide the stomach with increased surface area for nutrient absorption. When food enters the stomach, these folds stretch outward. This allows the stomach to expand, therefore increasing the volume of the stomach without increasing pressure.
