4 Jul 2011. Benzodiazepines like Valium can stay in the system a pretty long time. It depends on how much you take and for how long. Also your health, age, weight and metabolic rate play a part. How long a drug stays in your system depends mainly on it's elimination half life. For Valium (diazepam) the initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48 hours).
