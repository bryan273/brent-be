Painted metal roofs come with a baked-on factory finish, and you can re-coat these, -- as well as paint bare metal roofing -- with acrylic latex paint. You can also use oil-based alkyd paint, but you need to first apply an undercoat of a galvanized metal primer such as Sherwin-Williams Pro Industrial Pro-Cryl Universal Acrylic Primer. Use the primer even if you add a topcoat of acrylic latex paint, because the primer inhibits rust and bonds better than paint.
