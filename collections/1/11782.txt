Fungi are capable of producing many colors, and the species that invade nails and cause a discolored toenail are no exception. In laboratory culture, the so-called dermatophytes are predominantly yellow, mahogany brown, or reddish, while saprophytic fungi that invade nails are often green, black or brown, or colorless.ther possible explanations would include a recent blow to the tip of the toe, causing bleeding and blackening under the nail, bacterial growth beneath the nail (often a green color), continuous use of nail polish on the nail, or some other uncommon medical condition. The problem, however, is usually fungus.
