Here is a recipe for the rub I use on pork shoulders. After you apply a layer of mustard to the pork shoulder, completely coat the shoulder with a good BBQ rub. I have found that it helps to pat the rub into the shoulder to make it stick better. Make sure you have some brown sugar in your rub to add flavor.
