Expect to pay $175-$800 or more for a deep well jet pump, depending on materials, capacity, motor (1/2HP to 2HP) and features such as multiple stages (to lift water from greater depths). For example, the cast iron Flint & Walling CPJ15 Deluxe Deep Well Jet pumps depths up to 150' and costs $675-$745.
