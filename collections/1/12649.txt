Telephone and data wiring are low-voltage wires used for “land line” telephones and for internet hookups. Telephone cable may contain four or eight wires. Category 5, or Cat 5, cable, the most common type of household data wiring, contains eight wires wrapped together in four pairs. It can be used for both phone and data transmission and offers greater capacity and quality than standard phone wire.
