It is important to keep your freshly cut flowers out of direct sunlight when not inside the flower refrigerator. Another advantage of using a floral refrigeration unit is that your flowers will not compete with other items or produce such as vegetables and fruits. Keeping flowers near vegetables and fruits such as bananas or apples can actually accelerate rotting and wilting of the flowers.
