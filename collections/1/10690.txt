The mouth is very vascular, so there would be lots of blood...but there is more tissue holding your tongue down than just the frenulum so I think you would still be keeping your tongue! I am an RN in a NICU and have seen babies who are tongue tied and get the frenulum clipped. Hope that answered your question!
