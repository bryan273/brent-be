An Act of Congress created the Territory of Nevada on March 2, 1861. James W. Nye of New York was appointed Nevada's first Territorial Governor by President Abraham Lincoln later that year. On October 31, 1864, President Lincoln proclaimed Nevada's admission to the Union as the 36th state. The State's first elected Governor, Henry Blasdel, took office on December 5, 1864. Today, Nevada is the nation's seventh largest state in land area. Several hundred mountain ranges cross its landscape, many with elevations over 10,000 feet.
