The 2014 Ford Explorer is available in four trims: Base, XLT, Limited and Sport. Just over $30,000 for a base version buys you quite a bit of vehicle with a V6 engine, single-zone climate control with rear auxiliary climate control and power driver's seat. Standard audio is a 6-speaker AM/FM/CD system with aux and USB inputs.
