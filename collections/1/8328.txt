The Esperanza Fire started on Oct. 26, 2006, in Cabazon, Calif., about two hours north of San Diego. Driven by Santa Ana winds, it burned 41,000 acres and destroyed 34 homes. An investigation later determined that the fire was set by an arsonist, and in 2009 Raymond Lee Oyler was sentenced to death for the crime.
