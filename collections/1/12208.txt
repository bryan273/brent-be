Answer by kmccarte (187). Typically, when roasting a duck, you want your oven temperature to be between 350 and 375 degrees (Farenheit). This provides for a quick enough cooking time, yet still allows the duck to remain moist and tender. Higher oven temperatures when roasting duck are typically to achieve crispy skin.nswer by Debi68 (70). There are many answers to this question, I preheat the oven to 400 degrees and cook duck for about 20 minutes per pound, use a meat thermometer for internal temperature.
