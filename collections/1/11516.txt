Pool water pH values below 7.0 creates a corrosive environment, or an acidic condition. Add a base to bring the pH up, into a more basic range to prevent corrosion. pH levels in the pool water have ideal range of 7.4 to 7.6, and whether higher or lower, itâ€™s not good for the pool or swimmers. At levels above 7.8 only 50% of your chlorine will be active.
