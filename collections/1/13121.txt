The AKC points out that Shih Tzus and Yorkies require daily brushing to avoid matting and tangling. Just as Yorkie and Shih Tzu parents often prefer, shorkie parents can opt for a monthly visit to the groomer for any shorter cut that requires less daily maintenance, such as the puppy cut recommended by the SCA.
