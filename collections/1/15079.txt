This album's first two singles — She Doesn't Cry Anymore, previously found on Shenandoah, and Mama Knows — brought the band to the Top Ten for the first time. After these singles came three consecutive Billboard number-one hits: The Church on Cumberland Road, Sunday in the South and Two Dozen Roses.
