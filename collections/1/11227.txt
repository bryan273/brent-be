No, she doesn't count as a dependent until she's born. So if she's born in June 09 the first year you can claim her is next year when you do your 2009 taxes. The baby will count as a dependent in the year he or she is born. If born on Dec 31, 2009, you will have a dependent tax deduction for 2009. And you will need to get social security number to claim the child on your taxes. I had the same question when my first son was on the way.
