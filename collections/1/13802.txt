In the lower elevations, snows of 1 or more occur rather infrequently--usually only a few times each winter. Typically this snow melts within a few hours of falling. At higher elevations, the climate is significantly cooler than in the surrounding lowlands and the mountain peaks receive much more snow. At nearly a mile high, Newfound Gap (elevation 5,046') receives an average of 69 of snow during the winter season.
