Physical Detachment - Distancing Yourself From Others. Anxiety and stress cause people to feel as though they need to be alone. In fact, one of the most common ways people react to stress is to go home, lay on the couch, and avoid fun activities. Part of that is because of emotional detachment (which we'll get to later), but a bigger part of that is simply because of how difficult it is to feel comfortable with others around you.
