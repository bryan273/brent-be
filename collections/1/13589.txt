I've used a lot of garnier and herbal essences shampoos and conditioners, they smell great but they do leave a lot of residue on the hair. i went to a hairdresser and the first thing she asks is what shampoo i was using because there was ALOT of buildup, smell great but leave your hair less than clean.
