But since they were frozen in such a dense mass, the shrimp got waterlogged before they had a chance to defrost. If you encounter a shrimp block in the future, keep it in its bag and sink the whole thing in a bowl of cool water (like you would defrost chicken or a steak). Then, once itâ€™s softened you can run under cool water to finish the job if necessary.
