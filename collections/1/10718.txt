14-pound baby nicknamed 'mini sumo wrestler' born in Kansas. A Kansas woman gave birth last week to a 14.4-pound baby, and the boy is making headlines for the quirky nickname his nurse reportedly gave him. Baby Moses isn’t the biggest baby born in the world or even the United States. According to Guinness World Records, those honors respectively belong to a boy weighing 22 ½ pounds in Aversa, Italy, in 1955, and a boy weighing 22 pounds in Seville, Ohio, in 1879.
