The pre-heating stage takes around 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the dehydrator. While the dehydrator heats add the meat to the drying trays. The meat strips should be aligned in a single layer with spaces between them to allow good air flow. This may take six to 18 hours. There can also be a need to periodically rotate the trays for even cooking.
