/ Tuesday, May 13, 2014. DEAR DR. ROACH: I have a question about the results of a routine colonoscopy I had yesterday. It was found that I have a twisted colon. Since I was under a twilight pain medicine for the procedure, the doctor couldn't complete the last portion, because it was too painful for me.
