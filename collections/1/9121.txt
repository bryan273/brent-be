The inside of the body is covered with soft tissue called fascia. This tissue covers evert structure including organs, muscles, nerves and blood vessels. The fascia that covers your muscles is call myofascia. When the myofascia is stressed from overuse or trauma it can tear and adhear together. These adhesions are called trigger points and can prevent the muscles from working well. Trigger points lead to an increase in muscle stiffness and tenderness and a decrease in range-of-motion. In additiona, the discomfort from trigger points can radiate from the adhesion. This is called referral pain and the most common pathways are shown in this image.
