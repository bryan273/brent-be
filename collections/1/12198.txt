To have your number plate made up you will need to go to a registered supplier taking with you proof of entitlement to the mark which could be one of the following: 1  Vehicle Registration Document (V5).2  Certificate of Entitlement to a mark (V750).2: Do I need to inform my insurers that I have a new registration mark? Yes, remember to tell them in writing that 'In the event of a total loss claim...' whereby they effectively buy your vehicle (or what's left of it) off you due to theft, or as a 'right off', '...the registration mark will remain your property'.
