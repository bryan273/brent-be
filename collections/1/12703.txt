Professional caprine weed control operations prefer brush or briar goats, which are not a particular breed. Brush goats are generally a cross between a meat and dairy breed. The ideal brush goat is hardy, healthy and good-tempered. The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Cooperative Extension website states that in research trials, brush-type goats demonstrate stronger parasite resistance than other goats.
