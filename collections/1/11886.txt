Prague Weather in October. Our Prague Weather in October is usually quite good. Just think of classic fall temperatures, beautiful leaves and color throughout the city. It's a fantastic month to visit and experience the city's atmosphere, cafes and more. Personally, we think the October is delightful - usually it's not too cold and not too warm.
