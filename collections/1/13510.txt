Cleaning the mildew and mold from the wood is a good idea. You don't want it covered up. Cleaning can be accomplished in several ways. You may be able to remove the black stains using liquid dish soap and water and a scrub brush. Don't worry: the water is not going to harm the wood since it's able to dry rapidly. Chlorine bleach is also very effective at cleaning up the mold and mildew. You can mix a 50-50 solution with regular chlorine bleach and water. Some people don't do well with the fumes, so be careful.
