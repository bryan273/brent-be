I have used the Raspberry Pi for routing, and it worked well. As you say, you need at least one more network interface, as the Raspberry Pi has only one Ethernet port. You can add another interface connected to the USB port. I have used a GSM modem and a Wi-Fi stick. Things to note: 1  Use a powered USB hub. 2  Wi-Fi and GSM devices demand more power than what the Raspberry Pi's USB ports can supply. 3  If you shop for Wi-Fi devices, get one with good Linux support.
