Neurons can be classified based on their function as sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons convey sensory impulses from sensory organs toward the central nervous system, which includes the spinal cord and brain. They follow ascending, or afferent pathways, so called ‘afferent neurons’. The cell body of the sensory neurons is located in the peripheral sensory ganglia, in the peripheral nervous system. Sensory neurons are unipolar neurons with afferent fibers, which extend between sensory receptors and central nervous system.
