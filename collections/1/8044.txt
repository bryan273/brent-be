Airways—have settled on a uniform size (for now). It’s 22 inches high x 9 inches deep x 14 inches wide—these are external dimensions, including wheels and the handle. A few U.S. airlines are more generous with their carry-on size allowance, but some also impose weight restrictions and/or fees for carry-on baggage.
