MAR 2, 2015. Lamborghini revived the Superveloce name for its newly-improved Aventator, and it's a deserving wearer of the name. Feast your eyes, on the lighter, rawer, more powerful Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce, the fastest production Lamborghini ever built. The naturally-aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine gets a 50-horse bump to 750 screaming horsepower and 690 lb-ft of torque, thanks in part to a freer-flowing exhaust and refined valve timing.
