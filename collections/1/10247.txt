Report Abuse. Seasonal usually means you'll only have the job for one or two seasons out of the whole year, the best example is of summer jobs that teenagers usually get and that end when school picks up in the fall. I'd go for the job at Target's if you want a year round job. Hope this helps :). Skye Â· 7 years ago.
