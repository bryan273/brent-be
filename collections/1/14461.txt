The problem is that plants can not use nitrogen in this form. For them it needs to be converted to either ammonia which is a combination of nitrogen and hydrogen or nitrates-a combination of nitorgen and oxygen. Stage Two. This is the early stage of what we might call soil. Here we add some life, specifically lichens. Lichens are a symbiotic relationship of algae and fungus. The algae has the very important role of fixing the nitrogen, changing it from nitrogen gas to a form the plant can use.
