1 Choose an area with plenty of sun exposure. Partial shade will also work, however the bulbs planted in areas with full sun exposure will grow faster and bloom first. 2  Top off the soil with mulch, which should be factored in to the planting depth.  Don't forget to water the area where you plant your bulbs.
