Figure 1. Types of movement across membranes. Molecules can diffuse across a. membrane down a concentration gradient without the aid of a protein or the input of. energy. Passive and active transport require membrane transport proteins. Channel. proteins carry out passive transport, but carrier proteins can carry out passive or active. transport.
