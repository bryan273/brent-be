Orvis clothes are cut generously to accommodate an active country lifestyle. In addition, we build plenty of “wearing ease” into all our garments to ensure you will enjoy them for many years. We field-test all of them on Orvis associates, and we take into consideration how the clothing will be worn. For example, when we fit outerwear, we always size it with the appropriate layers beneath. That means you do not need to order a size up for a comfortable fit.
