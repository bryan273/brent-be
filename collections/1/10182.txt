Understanding Physical Disabilities. Many causes and conditions can impair mobility and movement. The inability to use legs, arms, or the body trunk effectively because of paralysis, stiffness, pain, or other impairments is common. It may be the result of birth defects, disease, age, or accidents. These disabilities may change from day to day. They may also contribute to other disabilities such as impaired speech, memory loss, short stature, and hearing loss. People with mobility and movement impairments may find it difficult to participate when facing social and physical barriers.
