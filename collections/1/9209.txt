Master insurance generally covers the exterior structures of all condo buildings as well as common areas such as pools, tennis courts or common rooms. In the event of a disaster, your condo complex's insurance will repair these areas, but will do nothing to restore your unit. You are responsible for replacing items such as wallpaper and carpeting.
