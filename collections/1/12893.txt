P.S. If you have blood in your urine, then worry, there is something going on in there, if you burn when you pee, go to doc. takes 10 min. to get a scrip for antibiotics then your all better. If you go to pee and you find that your tally-whaker is gone. Call your bf/gf/husband/wife and tell them you want it back..
