The Great Altar of Pergamon is considered to be one of the greatest surviving monuments from antiquity. Now located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, Germany, the altar is thought by many scholars to be the throne of Satan, referred to by the prophet John in the Book of Revelations. (Revelation 2:12-13).
