HELP NAME THE NEW LOCHBUIE ELEMENTARY. 1  The new elementary school in Lochbuie has yet to be named, and the district has established a plan to identify a name before groundbreaking during the summer of 2017. The Lochbuie Design Advisory Group was tasked with recommending a name to the Board of Education by the middle of May.
