Fluids are conventionally classified as either liquids or gases. The most important difference between these two types of fluid lies in their relative compressibility: i.e. , gases can be compressed much more easily than liquids. Fluids are isotropic media: i.e. , there is no preferred direction in a fluid. 2  Fluids are Newtonian: i.e. , there is a linear relationship between the local shear stress and the local rate of strain, as first postulated by Newton.
