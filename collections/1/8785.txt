Summer weather really starts in July and ends in September. Summer temperatures average around 80 degrees but do go over a 100 for one or two days a year. Overnight temperatures average around 60 degrees. This is a 90 day period that typically has very little (and sometimes none) rain. The summer is really one of the best parts about Portland.
