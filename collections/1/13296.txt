Fission splits the atom into smaller nuclei and releases radiation, free neutrons, and heat. Some of those free neutrons are then absorbed by other atoms, creating a chain reaction. At todayâ€™s nuclear power plants, these chain reactions are controlled inside of a nuclear reactor that is surrounded by water.
