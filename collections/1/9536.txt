When purchasing garlic supplements, pay attention to manufacturers that claim their product is odorless.. Odorless garlic formulas are often aged, reducing the amount of allicin and potentially deeming the product ineffective for alternative medicine use.lthough the National Institutes of Health states that garlic supplementation is considered safe for consumption by most adults, herbal supplements are not subject to approval by the FDA. It is always a good idea to let your physician know what supplements you take on a regular basis.
