As of now rabies shots are no longer administered around the navel area. At present, the human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) for immediate protection is injected into and around the bite site. If the bite area is small, the remaining amount is injected into other body parts - deltoid (shoulder muscle), lateral thigh or in the buttock. Rabies vaccine are injected at deltoid in adults or older children. The lateral aspect of the thigh muscle is acceptable in younger children.
