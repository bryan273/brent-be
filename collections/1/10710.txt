Handle the fresh seafood correctly before freezing. Fresh seafood should be well iced at all times. Fishing and shrimping trips require a quality ice chest with plenty of ice. As fish are caught, they should be well iced by mixing ice and fish together. Initial icing requires at least one pound of ice to every pound of fish, with 2 pounds ice per pound of fish recommended. Shrimp should also be well iced by mixing.
