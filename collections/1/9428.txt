What can cause tastes to change? Taste buds are constantly being replaced, so changes in health, nutrition, medications, hormones and age can all affect how they function, causing foods to taste bland or all the same, or leading to a metallic, sweet, chalky, blood-like or otherwise undesirable taste in the mouth.
