The Earth's orbit is an ellipse, and there is a slow change in its orientation, which gradually shifts the point of perihelion in space. The two effects — the precession of the axis of rotation and the change in the orbit's orientation — work together to shift the seasons with respect to perihelion.Because we use a calendar year that is aligned to the occurrence of the seasons, the date of perihelion gradually regresses through the year.he two effects — the precession of the axis of rotation and the change in the orbit's orientation — work together to shift the seasons with respect to perihelion.
