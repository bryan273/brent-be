Deserts, like forests and grasslands, occur all around the world. Symmetrical clusters of deserts are found around the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn-the two latitudes that define the area where the sun's angle at solar noon is closest to ninety degrees overhead at the Equinox.ome famous deserts are the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in Asia, the Sahara in northern Africa, and the Great Sandy and Simpson deserts in Australia. Deserts can come and go with changes in climate.
