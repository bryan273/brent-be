At Frankfurt in September 1987, BMW introduced a major update to the E30 (often called Series 2). The changes to the lineup were the addition of the touring (station wagon) variant and removal of the 325e model. The M10 4-cylinder engine was replaced by the M40.ll variants used a rear-wheel-drive layout with the exception of the all-wheel-drive 325iX. The BMW M3 was first introduced on the E30 platform. The E30 was released in 1982 and was replaced by the BMW E36 in 1992.
