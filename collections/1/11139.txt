Spreads are typically lower in calories, fat, and saturated fat than butter or margarine. Some brands boast that they’re made with olive oil or canola oil, but that doesn’t mean they have the same nutritional profile as the oils themselves. Most are a blend of the featured oil and other vegetable oils.nd all spreads—even those made with olive oil (such as Olivio) or yogurt (Brummel & Brown)—have trans or saturated fat. Our tasters liked Brummel & Brown 35% Vegetable Oil Spread (which contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil) and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter Light (which has palm and palm kernel oils).
