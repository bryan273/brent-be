Blood clot dissolving agent. Blood clots are masses of blood cells that have clumped together because of disease or injury. In cases of damage, blood platelets (roundish disks associated with clotting found in mammal blood) mass (gather together) to stop bleeding. The platelets release clot-promoting chemicals and cause a clot to form.
