I think the holes are there to make it more abvious where the level is for people like me that can not see real good when the oil is clean. As long as the oil is at least near the middle of the hash marks you should be fine.On a fresh oil change, make sure after starting the engine and letting the oil filter fill, that after you stop the engine the level is at the top of the hash marks (at the top hole).an 22 2012, 4:45am. The bottom dot means fill the top means full. The other three dots break up the low and full in quarters and not quarts. If each mark was a quart you would be running on 2 quarts and still in standards.........
