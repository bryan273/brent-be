The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is called the atomic number. Atoms of the same element have the same atomic number. For sodium (Na) the atomic number is 11. All sodium atoms must have 11 protons in their nucleus. The atomic number therefore tells you what the element is (see the periodic table).
