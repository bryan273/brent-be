(Mac or PC). you need a device to get the signal to your computer. there are several brands out there. with mine, i can take vcr, audio or a digital signal and transfer it to my hard drive via iMovie then to iDVD to burn. the mac works great. i can also use Toast to burn as well (this is a software program from Roxio).he shows you seek from the DVR can only be captured from it's analog output: the S-video or composite or component ports. That is where the DVD-R gear comes in handy. If you record to a DVD-R the content in now on a media you can move from the DVD-R to your Mac.
