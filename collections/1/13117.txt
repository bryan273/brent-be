A standard Yorkshire terrier usually weighs no more than 7 pounds, but a Shih Tzu is considered small at 9 pounds. Because they're a designer cross and not an official breed, there is no real standard for a shorkie's size, but the Shorkie Club of America lists the typical weights from 4 to 12 pounds.
