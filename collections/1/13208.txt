The DNA double helix is held together by two types of bonds, covalent and hydrogen. Covalent bonds occur within each linear strand and strongly bond the bases, sugars, and phosphate groups (both within each component and between components). Hydrogen bonds occur between the two strands and involve a base from one strand with a base from the second in complementary pairing. These hydrogen bonds are individually weak but collectively quite strong. 3. A primer is a short segment of RNA that is synthesized by primase using DNA as a template during DNA replication.
