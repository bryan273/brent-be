Add an acid to bring down the pH to prevent the formation and build-up of scale. Total Alkalinity measures the hydroxides, carbonates and alkaline substances in the pool water. A close cousin of pH, Alkalinity buffers your pH, keeping it more stable. When TA is too low, pH levels are erratic, and not stable.
