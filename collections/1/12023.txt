If you want to burn an MP3 CD, you need to convert the files to MP3 first. Level 1 (0 points). I, too, can not burn CDs from songs purchased from itunes, but I'm using a PC. My problem is that I need to convert the song to .wav in order to use Audacity to shorten the song to a length usable for a dance with my dog.
