Detox water is water that has been mixed with the taste of fresh fruits, vegetables or herbs. You can make detox water at home in lots of different ways, using any combination of fruits, vegetables, and herbs that you like. Because it is made by suffusing taste rather than juicing or mixing, detox water contains a very low number of calories.
