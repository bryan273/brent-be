Steam has recently create a bunch of 'Trading Cards' and a Steam level version of the achievement system. Because of the Steam sale a bunch of these cards are being given away with the name of games you don't own attached. You didn't really get the game, you received a trading card based on the game, and that went into your steam inventory.
