Crossdresser is often synonymous with the term transvestite and both only refer to the clothes a person is wearing without making any comment on which gender the person acts as (this is related to transexuality or transgenderism) or their sexuality. My dad crossdressed as Marilyn Monroe for the Hallowe'en party.
