Oysters fall into five species: Eastern, Pacific, Kumamoto, Olympia, and European Flat (or Belon). The many varieties within each species take their names from the body of water from which they’re harvested: Wellfleet oysters from Wellfleet, Mass., Hama Hamas from Washington’s Hamma Hamma River and so on.
