How to Make Beef Jerky Without a Dehydrator. Beef jerky can be made at home without needing any fancy equipment such as a dehydrator. With minimal adjustments a home oven can be used, which can actually dehydrate a greater amount of food at once than most store bought dehydrators. Any meat can be used to make jerky, but it makes sense to purchase an inexpensive cut since you won't need the tenderness of an expensive cut like a filet mignon.
