While purchased content on iTunes cannot be refunded, iTunes doesn't charge you for pre-orders until they're released, so you technically haven't purchased the content yet. To cancel a pre-order, click Store in iTunes' menu bar and select View My Apple ID.. From there, select Manage Pre-Orders, where you can check the release date for upcoming items or cancel the pre-order.
