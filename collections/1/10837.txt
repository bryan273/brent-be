Purim's remarkable six-octave range and, more importantly, her control of it throughout make the first part of Dr. Jive a clarion call for the entire album. Purim's a far better fit for Clarke's Butterfly Dreams than Dee Dee Bridgewater, who sang it on his Journey to Love (Polydor, 1972). More nuanced and less disposed to vocal gymnastics, Purim manages to get deeper inside the lyrics, with its rubato intro an ideal vehicle for her understated yet passionate delivery.
