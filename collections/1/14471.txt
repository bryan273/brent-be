Those are 32nds of an inch! The longest of these black lines indicates the halfway point between each inch. It's the half-inch mark. So if you want to cut a board 3 and Â½ inches wide, you'd make a crisp pencil mark on the board at the longest line in between the 3 and 4-inch markings on the tape measure. The next longest lines on the edge are the quarter-inch markings.
