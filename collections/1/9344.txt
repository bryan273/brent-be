Lipid droplets form the main lipid store in eukaryotic cells. Although all cells seem to be able to generate lipid droplets, their biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms and interactions with other organelles remain largely elusive.In this article, we outline some of the recent developments in lipid droplet cell biology.ipid droplets form the main lipid store in eukaryotic cells.
