David Baszucki and Erik Cassel founded Roblox, then known as Dynablocks, in 2004. After a year of development, Dynablocks was renamed ROBLOX and was launched into Beta in 2005. In 2005, people could gain the currency at that time, Roblox Points, by completing single-player minigames developed by other users.
