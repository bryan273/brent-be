New Zealand Earthquake. The devastation from the powerful earthquake that just ravaged the people of the South Island of New Zealand is heartbreaking to say the least. We in Disturbed, would like to encourage everyone to please donate what you can to the local New Zealand Red Cross to help with disaster relief.
