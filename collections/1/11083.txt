The rate at which your body metabolizes food dictates how long you will remain satisfied after eating. Foods that metabolize slowly often leave you feeling full for upward of two hours after eating them. The system used to rate how long foods take to digest is called the glycemic index. If a food has a high glycemic index, it requires less time to digest, leaving you hungry soon after eating. Foods with a low glycemic index ward off hunger.
