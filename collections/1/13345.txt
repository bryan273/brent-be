Much of the remaining iron is stored in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin (a degradation product of ferritin) in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow or is located in myoglobin in muscle tissue [1,5]. Humans typically lose only small amounts of iron in urine, feces, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin.
