What is fibromyalgia? Fibromyalgia (\fi·bro·my·al·gi·a\) is a condition that causes pain all over the body (also referred to as widespread pain), sleep problems, fatigue, and often emotional and mental distress. People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive to pain than people without fibromyalgia.
