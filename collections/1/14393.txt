NTP lets you automatically sync your system time with a remote server. The NTP can be used to update the clock on a machine with a remote server. This keeps your machineâ€™s time accurate by syncing with servers that are known to have accurate times. NTP also keeps the clocks on several machines in sync, thus making it easier to match log entries for an event across multiple servers.
