The credit for child-care expenses is a percentage of the amount paid, and you can use $3,000 in expenses paid for one qualifying child or $6,000 in expenses for two or more qualifying dependents as a factor in the formula. The percentage is based on your adjusted gross income, and can range from 20%-35%.
