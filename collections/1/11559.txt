Old World rats are killed by vehicles, traps, poisons, or other rats. 1  Some domestic cats and dogs capture rats, usually small ones. 2  Owls, hawks, foxes, coyotes, and weasels prey upon rats; snakes eat immature rats. 3  The average life span of a rat in the wild is less than one year, with females living longer than males.
