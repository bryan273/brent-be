Prune juice is an effective remedy for constipation in both children and adults. When giving prune juice to an infant, the Mayo Clinic recommends trying 2 to 4 ounces at a time and adjusting the amount as needed. For adults, drink 4 to 8 ounces of prune juice each morning to stimulate a bowel movement. Just remember that more isn’t always better. Adding more fiber doesn’t always help stimulate a bowel movement. It can make you feel worse if you are dehydrated.
