Red Spider Lily. Multiflowering, bright red flowers make a dramatic statement! Strap-shaped green foliage disappears in July in preparation for the flower spike bursting forth in August. Grow in cool greenhouses or outdoors in warmer areas where little or no frost is experienced. Apply winter cover in zones lower than 7.
