Itunes tells me that I can not convert a song that was PURCHASED from the itunes store. The ONLY reason that I purchased songs is to dance with my dog to them, so I need my money back if I can't use any of them. Level 9 (78,015 points). You can burn iTunes purchases to an audio CD. Level 2 (325 points). You can shorten the play time with iTunes. Select that song you want to shorten and the select Get Info.
