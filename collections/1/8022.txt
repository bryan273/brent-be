Employees under compressed work schedules are entitled to holiday premium pay if they are required to work during their basic work requirement on that day. The number of hours of holiday premium pay may not exceed the hours in an employee's compressed work schedule for that day (e.g., 8, 9, or 10 nonovertime hours).
