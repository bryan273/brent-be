For many years, the Chiefs thrived in one of the International League’s smallest markets. Attendance spiked 33 percent to 400,804 in 1997, the first year at the new ballpark (which had been called Alliance Bank Stadium from 2005-13), and climbed to 446,025 in 1999—the high-water mark in franchise history.
