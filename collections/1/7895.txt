Getting started is as easy as enabling SmartGlass on your Xbox 360 console and SmartGlass-compatible device and then signing in. When the SmartGlass Experience is turned on across your devices, sign in to your Xbox 360 console using your Xbox Live profile. Then, sign in to your device using the Microsoft account associated with that profile. When you're connected, you'll see a notification on your console.
