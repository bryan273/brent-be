Line a 20x10x6cm terrine dish or loaf tin with fat and spoon in the mixture. Cover tightly with foil or greaseproof paper and put in a roasting tin on the middle shelf of the oven. Pour in boiling water to two thirds of the way up the terrine. Bake for about 70 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 65-70C or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out warm all the way through. Put a plate on top of the terrine, weigh down with a couple of tins and allow to cool.
