Walmart drivers deliver more than products to our stores. They ensure that our mission of Every Day Low Prices reaches our customers and communities. Our private fleet of over 7,200 drivers, 6,000 tractors, 53,500 trailers and 5,600 refrigerated trailers traveled approximately 700 million miles last year, and did it as one of Americaâ€™s safest private fleets.
