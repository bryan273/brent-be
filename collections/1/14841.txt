E-6000 – Whenever I say “strong glue” in a DIY I often follow it with “like e-6000”. Industrial strength, it is suggested for general use, wood, ceramics, fabric, metal and natural materials and it dries clear. To use apply a small amount and allow to sit until it becomes tacky. Then press the two items together.
