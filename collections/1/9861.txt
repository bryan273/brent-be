Freddie Fender the master of TexMex music singing Before The Next Teardrop Falls. The Lyrics. Untille The Next Teardrop Falls. If he brings you happiness, Then I wish you all the best. It's your happiness that matters. Most of all. But if he ever breaks your heart, If the teardrops ever start, I'll be there. Before the next teardrop falls.
