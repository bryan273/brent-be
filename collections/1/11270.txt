Very Expensive Power Steering Rack Replacement for 2008 Hyundai Sonata, $1,500. My Hyundai Sonata developed a whining noise whenever I turn. The local Hyundai dealer diagnosed the problem as steering rack failure, and need to be replaced. The cost is $1500, where the part is $900. I had never have this level of repair cost. In my impression, this is the same level as engine or transmission rebuild. Anyway, I should not ask too much about a 7 year old car.
