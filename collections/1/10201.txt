Swelling in one leg is less common than two legs and has a smaller number of possible causes. Edema means swelling of the soft tissues. It tends to occur in the feet, ankles and legs or the back in persons who are lying flat for long periods of time. It also most frequently occurs in both legs. The presence of edema in both legs has a broad number of possible causes. The presence of edema in one ankle narrows the diagnostic possibilities quite a bit. Video of the Day
