  An oxygen molecule is diatomic ie. it has two atoms (O2). As the atomic mass of a single oxygen atom is indeed 16, the molecular mass of O2 is (2 x 16) = 32.xygen-17 has 9 neutrons and 8 protons. The only difference is the atomic mass due to the different number of neutrons. Number of p â€¦ rotons & electrons stay the same. The difference is in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Oxygen-15 has 7 neutrons, oxygen-16 has 8, and oxygen-17 has 9.
