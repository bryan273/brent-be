County Roscommon. Roscommon (in Irish Ros Comáin) is the only totally landlocked county in the province of Connacht and rarely visited by tourists. Generally speaking it is quiet here – on 2,463 square kilometres of land only 64,065 people live (so says the 2011 census), this still is 23% more than in 1991.
