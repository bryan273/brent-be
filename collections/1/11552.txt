the largest rodent in the world is the capybara, but they are much bigger than a yorkie and they aren't available for the pet trade. the largest rat is the African pouch rat (and roughly the size of a yorkie), but they are invasive species and are forbidden in North America--so they won't be legal and available to you in the pet trade.
