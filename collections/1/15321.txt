I love you even if you think that i don't. Sometimes i find you doubt my love for you, but i don't mind. Why should i mind, why should i mind. What is love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway. What is love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway. Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear.
