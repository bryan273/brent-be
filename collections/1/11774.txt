1 The ideal weight for a man who is exactly 5 feet tall is 106 pounds. 2  For every additional inch above 5 feet, add 6 pounds. 3  To determine whether you have a small, medium or large frame, measure your wrist. 4  If your wrist measures exactly 7 inches, you have a medium frame and you do not need to adjust your ideal weight. What counts more than your body weight is your percentage of body fat. 2  As a male, your percentage of body fat should be about 10 to 15% for good health. 3  To determine your percentage of body fat at home, obtain some plastic body fat calipers and do a simple skin-fold test.
