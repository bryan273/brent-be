Galactose is found in several types of food, including sugar beets and dairy products. It is also produced naturally in the human body. In fact, galactose plays an important part in breast feeding. During lactation, one of the processes that take place is for the mother's body to convert glucose to galactose. This conversion is responsible for lactose being created and it also helps the breast milk to let down or release so the baby can feed.
