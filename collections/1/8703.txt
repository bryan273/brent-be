The third parameter to Navigate will set the value of the context variable in the target screen. Context variables will stay in the memory for that screen, until another value is set to the same variable. For example, if you navigate to screen B passing a value {a:1}, the value of a in that screen will continue being 1 until another call (to either Navigate to screen B passing a as a parameter or to UpdateContext) changes its value. â€“ carlosfigueira May 4 '17 at 20:46
