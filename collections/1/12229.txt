I never knew that I could eat such a small portion of food for lunch! I ate one very thin slice of homemade bread (make a loaf out of Pamelaâ€™s if you want gluten free or use rice crackers), with about two tablespoons of this pate, and topped it with ginger carrots. I was good for hours and hours after this lunch.
