Fetal-to-neonatal transition: Part 2. The transition from fetus to newborn is a process of rapid physiological adaptation that is sometimes delayed by complications. Most newborns complete the process of transition with little or no delay. These infants may demonstrate normal transitional findings, including tachypnea and tachycardia, a soft heart murmur and fine crackles in the lungs as well as acrocyanosis for varying lengths of time after birth.
