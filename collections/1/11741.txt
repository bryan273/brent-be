A shrimp boil sure is a fun, delicious way to bring people together. Itâ€™s communal eating at its best (and easiest). In only 20 minutes, you can turn out a hot pot of Boiled Shrimp with Tangy Cocktail Sauce onto a newspaper-lined picnic table, and everyone will gather together and dig into the shared pile of goodies.
