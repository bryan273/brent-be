Stroudsburg. Incorporated in 1815, Stroudsburg got its start as Fort Hamilton, one of a series of forts the Pennsylvania government built to protect settlers from the local Native Americans. The town's location at the confluence of the Pocono, McMichaels, and Brodhead creeks made it suitable for gristmill and sawmill businesses.
