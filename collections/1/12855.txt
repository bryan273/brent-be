Keep the water balanced. Know what your levels are at to avoid staining from minerals and metals. If you have metal problems, use a sequestering agent like Metal-Free to keep them in solution. Brush your pool surface weekly. Make it part of your routine. You do not need build-up on the surface of the pool, it just causes grief (and pool stains).
