Have your vehicle's exhaust system inspected periodically to keep your car safe. Loose, missing or damaged hangers or brackets can allow the exhaust system to shift around, causing a possible clunking or rubbing sound while driving. A loose exhaust system, when hot, can also melt wiring, nylon lines or rubber hoses.
