July 26, 2015, 10:01 pm. Paula Creamer and husband Derek Heath both travel for their jobs â€“ she's, of course, flying all over the world to play golf and he's a pilot for United. So Creamer got quite the surprise when she discovered the pilot for her flight to Scotland for the Women's Open was none other than her hubby. So this happened.... Heath Bars for the plane!!! @united pic.twitter.com/cXyLASDt93.
