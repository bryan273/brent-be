If Holland is right, I don't agree with your conclusion that we have a calendar year limit in the future. The 1/1 effective date is only an issue with the $160,000 in 2002. He is saying that a limitation year ending in 2002 is subject to the $160,000, but only for terminations after the effective date (1/1/2002). But, that is only an issue this year.
