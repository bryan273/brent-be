I think the script executed in 'Theo and the Joint' is a good outline for dealing with such a problem. Theo is a good kid, but doesn't do well in school. He has other character flaws but he is a good son to Cliff and Claire. When his mother finds a marijuana joint in his textbook, Theo vehemently denies that it is his.
