In this lesson we are going to learn the principles of drawing a circle as a vector ellipse in a 1 point Perspective and 2 Point Perspective view, using Adobe Illustrator. For this tutorial it is important to use vector drawing software such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW. In this case, we will be using Illustrator's Free Transform tool to distort the shape and aspect ratio or ellipse ratio of the circle to make it appear to be in perspective.
