Benevolent Distribution of Goods and Resources: setting limits to population and consumption; sharing and distributing any surplus yield. Yield is an important concept in Permaculture. System yield is the sum total of surplus energy produced by, stored, conserved, reused, or converted by the design. Energy is in surplus once the system itself has available all its needs for growth, reproduction and maintenance.
