Most forklift drivers work 8-hour (or longer) shifts, but that doesnâ€™t mean the job is a nine-to-fiver. In places where customers are around, most forklift work is done after hours. In 24-hour warehouses, shifts can be around the clock. Operating a forklift is considered a hazardous occupation, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
