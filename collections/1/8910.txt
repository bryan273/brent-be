Baby names from the wild. Share your love of animals by bestowing an animal-themed baby name upon your new baby boy or girl! We’re not talking Elephant and Giraffe, either — we have much cooler names in store for you. Being inspired by animals is nothing new — art, music and vehicles are just some of the ways we illustrate our love of animals.
