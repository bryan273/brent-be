With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively, liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a piece from liver slice.
