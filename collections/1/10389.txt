Roughly speaking, a confidence interval is range of numbers within which we believe the true population parameter to fall. Here, we will focus on how to calculate a confidence interval for a population mean. Letâ€™s think about this in terms of z-scores.hen we calculate a z-score, we want to look at how many standard deviations away from the mean our data point falls. A confidence interval relies on a similar principle. We want to estimate how many standard errors our sample mean falls from the true population mean on the sampling distribution.
