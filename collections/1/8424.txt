Although detox is primarily thought of as a treatment for alcohol or drug dependence, the term is also used to refer to a short-term diet that proponents claim can facilitate toxin removal and promote weight loss. Although there are many different types of detox diets, they generally follow the same principles: 1  Minimize the amount of chemicals ingested (for example, by eating organic food). 2  Emphasize foods that provide the vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants that the body needs for detoxification. Emphasize foods, such as fiber-rich foods and water, that increase the frequency of bowel movements and urination. What you can eat and can't depends on the particular detox diet. Some involve juicing or drinking liquids. Others allow some foods, such as fruits and vegetables, or include a broader range of foods.
