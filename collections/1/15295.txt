Beads are used to create jewelry or other articles of personal adornment; they are also used in wall hangings and sculpture and many other crafts. Beadwork techniques are broadly divided into loom and off-loom weaving, stringing, bead embroidery, bead crochet, and bead knitting. Most cultures have employed beads for personal adornment. Archaeological records show that people made and used beads as long as 5,000 years ago.
