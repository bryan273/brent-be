The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) recommends that each type of feline vaccine be given to cats in a specific location on the body. For feline 3-way or 4-way combination vaccines that do NOT contain feline leukemia, the injection should be given on the outside portion of the right front leg below the elbow joint. For rabies vaccines (which are administered by your veterinarian) the injection should be given subcutaneously on the outside of the right rear leg below the knee. For feline leukemia vaccines, the injection should be given on the outside of the left rear leg, below the knee.
