1 If the carrots are short and fat, hat's often because the soil is too heavy and you'll need to amend with leaves and sand. 2  Carrots do well in light (sandy), fluffy soil that is not too full of amendments. 3  Also, you might want to think them further; try an inch apart after the leaves reach about three inches high.he carrots start out fine, but when it is time for harvesting, the carrots do not get very bulky. The top half of the carrot is about an inch wide, but the rest of the carrot is one thin root that extends about 3 or 4 inches with no bulk at all.
