1 Wash your hands.  Check the expiration date on the vials of insulin. If they are not expired, pick up the cloudy bottle of insulin and roll it between your hands until it is mixed, until there is no powder on the bottom of the bottle. Do not shake the insulin bottle because this can cause air bubbles.
