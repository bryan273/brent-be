Are Swedish fish from Sweden? Answer Wiki. I didn't know what Swedish fish was, until I visited New York City. Yes, they are originally Swedish, but the ones sold in the US are produced in Canada. The ones we have here in Sweden are not called Swedish fish, they are not called anything in particular, just random candy. In Sweden we buy candy for $5 per pound by filling a bag with the stuff we want from a large selection, and Swedish fish is just one of many.
