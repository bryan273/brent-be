Most tapes that have this only do it for the first few inches on the tool. As you extend the tape measure, you'll probably see the numbers 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, etc. in red. The red indicates 16-inch-on-center spacing. This is a common framing spacing for wall studs, floor joists and common roof rafters.
