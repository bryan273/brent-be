Get the right size. “The main thing with kids’ bikes is having the right size bike for the rider,” says Jon Posner, store manager at Race Pace Bicycles in Ellicott City. Children’s bikes are measured by the diameter of the wheel, with sizes ranging from 12 inches to 24 inches. The appropriate size depends on the child’s age and height or leg length. For example, most 2-year-olds start on a 12-inch bike. To test proper fit, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends children sit on the seat with their hands on the handlebars.
