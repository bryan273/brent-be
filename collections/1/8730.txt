T test. This assessment requires the athlete to move in a T-shaped pattern (see page 43 of NSCA's Guide to Program Design for a detailed explanation of how to conduct this test). It requires lateral and front-to-back movements, and is often used as a drill and assessment for athletes in basketball and American football.
