When is the best time to plant tulips? October is the ideal time to plant tulips, daffodils and other spring-flowering bulbs in Iowa. When planted in October, spring-flowering bulbs have sufficient time to develop a good root system before the ground freezes in winter. If the ground isnâ€™t frozen, tulips and other spring-flowering bulbs can be planted as late as late November and early December.
