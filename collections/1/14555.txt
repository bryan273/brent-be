Where is the cruise ship dock - New Orleans Forum. Where is the cruise ship dock. Which New Orleans hotels are on sale? I am trying to find a map showing where the cruise ship dock is. We are coming to New Orleans next January for a cruise and I would like to find a hotel that is close to the dock. Does anyone know of a hotle that offers shuttle service to the dock? Otherwise a taxi will do.
