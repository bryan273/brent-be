Step 6. Plant one spider lily per planting hole. Plant each bulb with its nose facing upwards and its roots facing downward. Push each lily bulb into the soil gently to secure it in the soil. Scoop in approximately 3 to 4 inches of soil over each of the lily bulbs. Water the spider lilies thoroughly.
