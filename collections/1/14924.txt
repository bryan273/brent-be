In order for your body to build muscle, produce hormones, and fight off viruses and bacteria, you need to get enough protein in your diet. Proteins are large, complex molecules comprised of long amino acid chains. These make up the structure of your body’s tissues and organs. Without protein, your body could not function properly. Unfortunately, the body’s ability to break down and absorb protein decreases with age. Countering this is not as easy as simply drinking more milk or having an extra egg with breakfast.
