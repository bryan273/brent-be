The chambers are known as atria and ventricles. Each side of the heart is composed of one atrium and one ventricle. The atria are the receiving chambers of the heart, receiving blood flowing back to the heart. The ventricles are the chambers of the heart that pump the blood out of the heart. The valves of the heart are located within the chambers of the heart and are critical to the proper flow of blood through the heart.
