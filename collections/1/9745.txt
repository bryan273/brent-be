in this case you should definitely see a doctor in any case don t try to shave off the chest hair because it will grow back thicker than before you should try using tweezers for removal however i would advise you not to do anything before you talk to your mother or a doctorhe growth of some hairs on your chest and around your nipples is normal so if you have problems only with this hair than you have nothing to worry about but if you notice hair growing on your lower abdomen chin or mustache area than you probably have a medical condition that causes this problem
