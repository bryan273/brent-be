4. Place the roasting pan in the oven. After 15 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees. After 45 minutes, remove duck from oven. Remove any fat that may have collected in the bottom of the roasting pan.Carefully turn duck over, place back on rack in roasting pan, and return to oven for 35 minutes.At the end of the 35 minutes, remove duck from oven, remove any fat that may have accumulated, and carefully turn duck back over so breast side faces up. Return to oven.If you have a 5 pound duck, cook for another 15 minutes; for a 6 pound duck, cook for another 20 minutes (total cooking time should add up to about 22 minutes per pound). Be careful not to overcook. The internal temperature should be 175 degrees at the thickest part of the leg and thigh joint.ith a temperature of 425, then lowered to 350, my duck (5.75 lbs) took +/- 50 minutes longer than the cooking time in the recipe and possibly could have used 10-15 minutes longer. Yes, it was a Maple Leaf Farms duck. My oven is a late model electric oven.
