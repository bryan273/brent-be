Definition of Predictive Validity: In the context of pre-employment testing, predictive validity refers to how likely it is for test scores to predict future job performance. Predictive validity is one type of criterion validity, which is a way to validate a testâ€™s correlation with concrete outcomes. The best way to directly establish predictive validity is to perform a long-term validity study by administering employment tests to job applicants and then seeing if those test scores are correlated with the future job performance of the hired employees.
