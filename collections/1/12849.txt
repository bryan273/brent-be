For your pool plaster supplies, pour in premixed white Portland cement and marble dust; 2:1. Or use a pool plaster repair kit, like our EZ Patch pool plaster supplies. Use a bonding additive (like Acryl 60) to mix the plaster with, and prep the area to be patched. Trowel smooth with a round ended trowel.
