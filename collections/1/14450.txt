The mechanical part of hearing picks up sound from the outer ear canal and then vibrates the ear drum and the three tiny hearing bones in the middle ear. The inner ear looks a bit like a snail. It has two halves which are connected and are filled with fluid. The coil or cochlea takes care of the nerve part of hearing.
