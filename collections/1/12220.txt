A bridge is like three crowns connected together. The two teeth adjacent to the missing tooth are cut for dental crowns. The bridge is then placed onto those two adjacent teeth. The bridge has a fake tooth that connects to two crowned teeth and fills in the empty space from the congenitally missing tooth.
