Suppose you know some of the lyrics of a song but not the name of the album, artist or songtitle. You can then search here and it will give you the missing details. It also makes a link directly to Amazon.com if you want to buy the CD. Very impressive in that it's so simple yet useful. Well done Robert Synnott.
