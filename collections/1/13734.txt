The earliest patents for bubble blowers known date back to the 1920s. Pipes and wands were the earliest mass produced bubble blowers. Vintage bubble sets, most popular in the 1940s, generally came in brightly decorated boxes and included a bar of soap, a dish for the soap water, and a bubble pipe or two.
