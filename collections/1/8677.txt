NBC had a number of guidelines for what radio shows could and could not contain. This volume Broadcasting in the Public Interest, from 1939, outlines those rules. This first 'Standards and Practices' booklet soon became yet another standard throughout the industry. It was 6 by 9 inches and is 80 pages long.
