The Tilt of the Earth's Axis and its Elliptical Orbit. We have all been taught that the seasons are caused by the 23.4° angular offset (obliquity) between the Earth's axis of rotation and a perpendicular to the Earth's orbital plane with the Sun (see obliquity below).he two effects — the precession of the axis of rotation and the change in the orbit's orientation — work together to shift the seasons with respect to perihelion. Because we use a calendar year that is aligned to the occurrence of the seasons, the date of perihelion gradually regresses through the year.
