Evidently this was no surprise to the docs. Nerve pain is a tough pain to treat. I was put on an anti-seizure med which helped a little, but not enough to live a normal life, and had extreme side effects. Because of this pain, GBS victims have about a 20% fatality rate...from suicide. ANYTHING to stop the pain!
