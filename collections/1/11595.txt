Within the browser, you can get translations using the Bing Toolbar. Install it, and on the right hand side you'll see three dots '...'. Select this, then select 'Apps', and look for Translator on the left list. Select translator and then the 'Add' button. On your Bing toolbar you'll now see the Translator icon. (It looks like the letter 'a', a Japanese character and a couple of arrows) You can now press this button to translate the contents of the page, or the folks who are reading your emails in their browser can do likewise.
