Mix 4 tablespoons of almond oil and 3 to 5 drops of lavender, mint or rosemary essential oil into a glass jar with a lid to make a hot oil treatment for dry hair. Secure the lid and heat the oil in a pot of hot water for 15 minutes. Shake the jar well, then massage the oils into your dry hair and scalp.
