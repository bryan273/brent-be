Ptosis can occur in one eye or both eyes at the same time. Ptosis may be caused by normal aging, injury to the eye or an eye disease. In most cases, it is caused by weakness of the eyelid muscle or eye nerve problems. Sometimes the condition is present at birth, referred to as congenital ptosis. If left untreated, congenital ptosis may prevent normal vision development, and may increase the risk of developing lazy eye.
