Yes, apparently you can: As of 2007, you don't need a license to own one, but they do live up to 30 years, so it's a huge commitment to be a sloth owner. They also have stri â€¦ ct diets and habitat requirements.But in any case, it's at least legal.lso they are supplemented with all natural food and sloth mix. So as long as you can provide them what they need they do make very fun and loving pets. Careful though their nails do get long and can scratch when they go in for the hug! Thirdly I'm not a cat fan so I disagree with his last statement to.
