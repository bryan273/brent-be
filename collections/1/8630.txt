Some of you will say that another element, francium (atomic number 87), is even more unstable than astatine, and you're right. As Sam writes, If you had a million atoms of the longest-lived type of astatine, half of them would disintegrate in 400 minutes. A similar sample of francium would hang on for 20 minutes.
