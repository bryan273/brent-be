People with hypochondriasis misinterpret normal body sensations as signs of serious illness. Most people occasionally fear they have an illness, but people with hypochondriasis are consumed with fear. This fear is severe and persistent, and interferes with work, as well as relationships. Complaints tend to focus on the head, neck, and trunk, often in the form of pain.
