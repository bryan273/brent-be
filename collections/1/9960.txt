A pattern maker by trade, Ole Evinrude finished his first outboard motor in 1907 And even to this day, outboard motors are basically the same: using Oles idea of a vertical crankshaft, horizontal flywheels, and set of bevel gears. Today Evinrude motors will propel a boat a bit faster than the 07 version (150 mph versus 5 mph).
