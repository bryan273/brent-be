Even though you are making them home, juice should still only be served to your child on a sporadic basis. Remember, while prune juice is safe for your baby after six months of age, it is best to limit your child’s intake to 4 to 6 ounces per day. Water, breast milk and formula are all your child needs to consume for healthy growth and development. Do not forget to dilute your child’s juice with water before serving.
