A 12-lead ECG detects and amplifies these voltage changes between two electrodes as wavy lines on paper or a monitor screen. Electrodes are commonly placed in pairs, such as on the right leg and left leg. Each pairâ€™s output is called the lead, and it captures heart information from different angles. Unlike 12-lead ECGs, the information recorded by 3- and 5-lead ECGs is rarely printed out and generally is used as a form of continuous monitoring via a screen during ambulance transport or hospitalization.
