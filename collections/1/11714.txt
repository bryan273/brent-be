Answers. Best Answer: Most of the accessory structures of the skin, including the sweat glands, the oil glands, and the hair, are located in the dermis. The dermis consists mostly of connective tissue and is much thicker than the epidermis. It is responsible for the skin's pliability and mechanical resistance and is also involved in the regulation of the body temperature.
