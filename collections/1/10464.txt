Magma is molten rock found below the earth's surface. The temperature at which a rock melts is affected by its composition, pressure and water. Learn how magma forms and how it either feeds volcanoes or cools and crystallizes into igneous rock. Magma is defined as molten rock found below the earth's surface. It's a Greek word meaning 'thick ointment.' Why a geologist in the year 1859, which was the first known geological use of the word, decided that magma and ointment were similar is unknown. It would be one hot ointment.
