1 Simply go to the website for the department of health for the state that your baby was born in. 2  Many have a “birth section” that should explain how you can obtain a birth certificate. 3  The website of the CDC has a list of all state health departments (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm). Get a birth certificate for your baby at the hospital after having your baby there. 2  At most hospitals, it is mandatory that you be given the birth certificate before you leave. 3  If you weren't given one forthright, ask the hospital staff for a birth certificate form before leaving with the baby.
