Study the different types of tubal ligation and discuss with your gynecologist which one is best for you. If you develop symptoms of perimenopause after a tubal ligation, have your estradiol, progesterone AND FSH levels checked on day 21 of your menstrual cycle. FSH, the blood test for menopause, is OFTEN normal.
