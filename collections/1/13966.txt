What causes uterine fibroids? The causes of fibroids are not known. Most fibroids occur in women of reproductive age, and according to some estimates, they are diagnosed in black women 2-3 times more frequently than in white women. They seldom are seen in young women who have not begun to menstruate. The symptoms of uterine fibroids usually stabilize or go away in women after menopause.
