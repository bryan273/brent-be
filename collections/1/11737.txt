If you have an Administrator account, it doesn't have a password by default. If you can log in as that, you can change your other user's password going to Control Panel/User. Select the account and select change password. If you don't have an admin account, shut down and restart. While the computer is booting, press F8 to enter the Boot menu and boot in safe mode. Select Run from the start menu and type control userpasswords2. Select the account and select reset option. Type a new password into new password and confirm and your done.
