Earth's lopsided orbit. Earth’s perihelion (point closest to Sun) = 91,400,000 miles from Sun. Earth’s aphelion (point farthest from Sun) = 94,500,000 miles from Sun. While that is a difference of over 3 million miles, relative to the entire distance, it isn’t much.And, believe it or not, aphelion—when Earth is farthest from the Sun—occurs in July, and perihelion—when we are closest—occurs in January.any people believe that Earth is closer to the sun in the summer and that is why it is hotter. And, likewise, they think Earth is farthest from the sun in the winter. Although this idea makes sense, it is incorrect. It is true that Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle.
