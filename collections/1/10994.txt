This is where the phrase to ‘tie tubes’ comes from. The ‘tying of the fallopian tube’ is done only to prevent the cut tube from bleeding and also to accelerate the tube healing closed. Tied tubes can not simply be tied to cause blockage. Tubes can not reattach, they can not reconnect, nor can they regrow.
