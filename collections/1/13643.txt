As of 2003, about 290 million tires are discarded in the U.S. every year (roughly one per person). Nearly 45% of these scrap tires (130 million) are used as Tire Derived Fuel (TDF), which often involves burning the (usually shredded) tires alongside conventional fuels like coal (usually no more than 10-25% TDF is used when co-firing with coal).
