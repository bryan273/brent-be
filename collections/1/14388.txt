Most servers indicate the NTP version as well. It is always wise to consult the DNS to verify host addresses, which are changed from time to time. When more than one address is given, preference should given to each in order. Please respect the access policy as stated by the responsible person. It is very important that potential clients avoid use of servers not listed as open access, unless approved first by the responsible person. This especially includes indiscriminate use of servers not listed in the list, since this can be disruptive.
