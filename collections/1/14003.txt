Tickets for “Hamilton” in Los Angeles went on sale on Sunday, causing an instant internet traffic jam on Ticketmaster. I got my ticket: $150 all in for a seat near the back of the mezzanine on opening weekend — not bad considering the top listed price was $750. And it only took me 68 minutes, two computers and my iPhone to get it done. Could have been worse. “Hamilton” runs Aug. 11 through Dec. 30 at the Hollywood Pantages theater.
