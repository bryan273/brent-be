Significant damage was caused in three distinct regions: the area near the epicenter, and the areas around Munger (India) and Bhaktapur (near Kathmandu in Nepal); this damage pattern due to peculiar geology of the area is exactly similar to that of the 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake..2 ASSAM EARTHQUAKE OF 1897 The Assam earthquake of June 12, 1897 (magnitude 8.7) caused severe damage in an area of about 500 km radius (as against the area of about 10 km radius that sustained severe damage in the Latur earthquake!). The earthquake caused extensive surface distortions in the area.
