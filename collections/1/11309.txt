A real Certified Wholesale Distributor is a company who handles the wholesale shipments for the manufacturer of a product (or in some cases is the product manufacturer). They have a warehouse, distribution center and ship products directly to the Retailer (or to the customer if they deal in drop shipping). Certified Wholesale Distributors are who you, the Retailer, want to work with directly.
