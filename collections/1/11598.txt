Alice! Dear Reader, Contrary to popular belief, eating acidic foods will not cause one's stomach, blood, or entire body to become more acidic. In fact, during the process of digestion, the stomach secretes hydrochloric acid (HCl), a super-duper acidic substance that causes its contents to become acidic.he pH of hydrochloric acid is between 0.1 and 1.0 â€” probably the most acidic substance known to people. Eating acidic foods can't cause the stomach to become more acidic. It's already more acidic than the foods you may be eating.
