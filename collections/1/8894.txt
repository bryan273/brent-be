Seven days. That's it. Once you've boiled eggs, they have just one week until you should think twice about eating one. (That's assuming they've been stored in the fridge shortly after being boiled.) And if that hard boiled egg was peeled before being refrigerated, that knocks two more days off of its shelf life.
