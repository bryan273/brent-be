All rocks, once exposed on the surface of the Earth are subjected to processes of erosion, transportation and ultimately deposition. These topics are covered in detail in Geol. 201. For our current purposes, it is sufficient to state that such processes produce sediment which may ultimately be transformed into sedimentary rock. Sediment can be defined as any material that settles to the bottom of a fluid. Sedimentary rocks are classified in to three major categories based on the nature of the sediment. I. Detrital or Clastic Sediments These rocks are composed of fragments of pre-existing rock that have been eroded, transported and deposited in an accumulation that has subsequently been converted into a hard coherent sedimentary rock.
