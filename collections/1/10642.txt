Prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, divide by a different process called binary fission. Mitosis varies between organisms. For example, animal cells undergo an open mitosis, where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate, whereas fungi undergo a closed mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus.
