Recently, there have been some changes with the powertrain warranty coverage on new vehicles from General Motors and Fiat â€“ Chrysler Automobiles. Both automakers have dropped their powertrain warranty coverage to five years/60,000 miles from 10 years/100,000 miles. Powertrain warranties only cover a limited selection of items on your car, specifically components that only have to do with providing the vehicle power and making it move. Only Kia, Hyundai and Mitsubishi offer 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranties following the changes by GM and FCA.
