It’s no surprise that there are loads of “better than butter” products in super­markets today. Butter, after all, has 100 calories, 11 grams of fat, and 7 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon (about half the saturated fat you should consume in a day if you’re following a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet).Margarine has the same calorie and fat content as butter, but less saturated fat.nd all spreads—even those made with olive oil (such as Olivio) or yogurt (Brummel & Brown)—have trans or saturated fat. Our tasters liked Brummel & Brown 35% Vegetable Oil Spread (which contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil) and I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter Light (which has palm and palm kernel oils).
