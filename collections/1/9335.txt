Cell Type: mesenchymal cell. Cell Source: white adipose (fat) tissue. Cell Characteristics: Differentiated adipocytes are spherical in shape with differences in fat organelle (lipid droplet) size. Most space in the adipocyte is composed of fat organelles.Mature adipocytes often contain a single large lipid droplet.dipocytes store energy for the body in the form of triacylglycerol and play a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy regulation. Adipocytes have also been found to express a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules capable of inducing inflammation.
