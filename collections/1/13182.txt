Defining the 3 goals of palliative care. After finishing medical school and my residency in internal medicine, I undertook an additional year of training in a field called palliative care. Patients who notice my background sometimes ask me what exactly palliative care means. It’s really a simple concept. Palliative care is helping people with a serious illness have the best possible quality of life. It’s enabling sick patients to make the most of the time they have left to live.
