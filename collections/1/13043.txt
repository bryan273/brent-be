Lake Placid, Adirondacks. Algonquin Mountain. Algonquin is the tallest peak along the MacIntyre Mountain Range and the second highest in New York State. While the climb to the summit is only just over four miles, much of the route is steep and becomes progressively steeper as one approaches the summit.
