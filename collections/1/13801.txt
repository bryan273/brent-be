I live in Northern Utah and it does snow here. In fact we have snow in the mountains right now it has not really gotten cold enough yet to snow in the valleys. It varies how much snow we get some times we get a lot and sometimes we do not get a lot. I think last winter we had about 4-5 feet of snow on the lawn.
