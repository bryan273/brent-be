Be sure to match the style and quality of the new windows to your house -- high-end in a luxury home, midrange in an average home, says John Bredemeyer, an appraiser in Omaha. The value of high-end windows in a tract house won't necessarily be reflected in the home's appraised market value.e generally charges $40 to $200 per window to install them. Windows painted shut long ago will open and you'll preserve the architectural or historical character of your home -- which some neighborhoods may require anyway.
