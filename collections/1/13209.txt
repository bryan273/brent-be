By nitrogen bases, do you mean the nitrogenous bases in DNA? If so, do you mean, what bonds are inside the bases, or what bonds hold pairs of these bases together in DNA? The bases themselves are constructed out of covalent bonds, but it is Hydrogen Bonding that holds pairs of these bases together. Hydrogen Bonds, despite their name, are not bonds like covalent bonds, but are a kind of intermolecular interaction that holds the nitrogenous bases of DNA together.
