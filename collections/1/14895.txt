The dots are there to help you visualize where the level is. They DO NOT equate to one quart for each. If your oil level is at the bottom of the hashes, one quart should take it to the top as was posted before. Do NOT overfill. you can blow seals and oil all over.an 22 2012, 4:45am. The bottom dot means fill the top means full. The other three dots break up the low and full in quarters and not quarts. If each mark was a quart you would be running on 2 quarts and still in standards.........
