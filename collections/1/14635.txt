I thought about having a cup of warm lemon water, but wanted to try something new. I remembered that my mother often drinks warm prune juice for this type of issue, but I was never interested in trying itâ€“until last night. My results: drinking warm prune juice does work, and I only drank about 4 ounces of it, so yeah.
