Blemishes and Stains. Marcite or gunite plaster is subject to stains that can occur when the water is put into the pool. Stains will increase with time and can only be eliminated by acid washing. Unfortunately this practice causes marcite and gunite plaster to deteriorate and become pourous. As you know a pourous surface will attract dirt.
