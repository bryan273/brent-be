Simple Guidelines to Prolong Lithium-ion Batteries. 1  Do not discharge Li-ion too low; charge more often. 2  A random or partial charge is fine. 3  Limit the time the battery resides at 4.20/cell (full charge), especially if warm.  Moderate the charge current to between 0.5C and 0.8C for cobalt-based lithium-ion.
