You can be a muse without having a perfectly-proportioned body and a pretty face. Whatever it is that makes you different, play it up. An artist’s quest is to create something the world has never seen, something truly original. An artist’s muse is not just a model or mannequin, but a source of original energy and life. For example, Pablo Picasso's series of muses, including Dora Maar and Marie-Therese Walter, helped him see the human body in a new way and inspired him to share his insights with the world.
