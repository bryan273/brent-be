Tire temps will be on watch at Martinsville. Temperatures aren’t expected to be unseasonably warm when NASCAR’s Sprint Cup Series visits Martinsville (Va.) Speedway this weekend. That doesn’t mean heat won’t be a concern. In at least two of this season’s first five Cup races, excessive heat in the right-front wheel area has led to tire failures for several teams.
