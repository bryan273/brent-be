Techopedia explains Native Command Queuing (NCQ) NCQ replaces tagged command queuing (TCQ), which is used with parallel ATA (PATA). The manner in which TCQ interacts with the operating system (OS) taxes the CPU in return for little performance gain. Both in the hard drive and in the SATA host bus adapter, NCQ must be supported and enabled and the proper driver must be loaded into the OS.
