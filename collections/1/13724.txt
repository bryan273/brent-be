What it Takes to be a Professional Poker Player. First of all you need the technical skills to be a winner in at least one form of the game. Second of all you need to be sure about it by putting in a large sample size. Thirdly, you need to be able to deal with the financial and emotional swings. think very few people have the ability to become a truly successful professional poker player.
