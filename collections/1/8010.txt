A: It depends. It will probably be easier in the long run if you have your child’s birth certificate changed. But you do not need to because the court order is enough to get any government-issued documents changed or to prove you changed your child’s name.n top of the court fee, you may have to pay to publish notice of the hearing on your petition (the Order to Show Cause for Change of Name) in a newspaper. Publishing the name change notice in a local newspaper is required in most name change cases.
