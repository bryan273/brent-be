When a click beetle is touched, it falls on its back and plays dead. To right itself the click beetle bends its head and thorax forward, hooking a spine into a notch on the abdomen. When the spine is released, it makes a click, and the beetle is hurled into the air. Click beetles usually feed on leaves at night. Because they are attracted to sweet liquids, farmers once placed sweet baits in their fields in the spring to trap adults.
