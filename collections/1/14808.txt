A mule is the result of a horse that has been bred with a donkey. Mules are generally sterile, meaning that they cannot be bred with each other in most cases. They also have 63 chromosomes. In appearance, mules may look very similar to donkeys. They also have stiff hair. Much like donkeys, mules are strong animals and tend to have calmer personalities.
