Roblox was created by founder and co-founder David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and officially launched into its beta version, titled Dynablocks in 2005. Soon, Dynablocks was renamed to ROBLOX and the website was officially launched in 2006. It was named after a portmanteau of the words robots and blocks.
