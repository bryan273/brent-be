Bleeding or spotting later in pregnancy may be a sign of a serious problem, like: 1  Preterm labor. This is labor that happens too early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. 2  Placenta previa. This is when the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. 3  Placental abruption.
