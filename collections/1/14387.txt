With the -q option ntpd operates as in continuous mode, but exits just after setting the clock for the first time. Most applications will probably want to specify the iburst option with the server command. With this option a volley of messages is exchanged to groom the data and set the clock in about ten seconds. If nothing is heard after a few minutes, the daemon times out and exits without setting the clock.
