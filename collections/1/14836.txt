What is the strongest adhesive? In terms of tensile strength the strongest adhesives are epoxy adhesives, specifically single component heat curable epoxy adhesives. Let me clarify – single component epoxy adhesives have the highest tensile strength often 35-41 N/mm² (5100– 6000 psi). Tensile strength of the adhesive is simply how strong the cured adhesive is.
