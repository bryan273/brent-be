Some people don't know the difference between a tsp and TBS. It shows up frequently in Sparkrecipes. Holy cow, you should see the sodium content on some when what should be a tsp gets entered as a Tbsp! Some people do know the difference between a TBSP and a tsp, but may not do the math properly. It's probably best to enter the TBS data, but change the serving size to .33 since 3 tsps = 1 Tbsp, then the tracker will do the math for you.
