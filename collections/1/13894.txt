Next, an oxygen atom is … just represented by the symbol O. An oxygen molecule, however, is represented by O2, which means 2 oxygen atoms are joined together by a bond. Therefore, 1 mole of oxygen atoms means 6.02 x 1023 O 's, while 1 mole of oxygen molecules means 6.02 x 1023 O2 's. They're quite different.xygen-17 has 9 neutrons and 8 protons. The only difference is the atomic mass due to the different number of neutrons. Number of p … rotons & electrons stay the same. The difference is in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Oxygen-15 has 7 neutrons, oxygen-16 has 8, and oxygen-17 has 9.
