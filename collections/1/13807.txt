Snow in Morocco is not unusual. Two ski resorts in the Atlas Mountains—one near Marrakech and the other near Ifrane—experience fairly regular snowfall each January and February. In fact, compared to conditions in February 2011, the snow cover this year does not appear that unusual. The cold temperatures of February 2012, however, are threatening Morocco’s sugar beet and sugar cane crops. Other parts of Africa and southern Europe faced unusually harsh winter conditions in February 2012.
