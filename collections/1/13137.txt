Its 252-mph top speed makes it the fastest production car in the world. With 1,001 horsepower pumping from its W16 engine, it's also the world's most powerful production car. And with a price tag of about $1.5 million, it's the world's most expensive new car. For the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, everything is a superlative. The Veyron is named in honor of a French racecar driver who won the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Bugatti -- quite the honor. Although Monsieur Veyron's namesake arrived in the world for the 2006 model year, as many car enthusiasts know, its gestation was anything but smooth.
