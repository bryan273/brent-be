I have Chrome installed to deal with websites that INSIST on flash to operate. But the UI bugs me off–especially the lack of a Menu Bar. The Chrome look is basically the Browser for people who Surf the Web wherever the Links tell them to…the Browser with Controls is the Browser for people who Work with the Web.
