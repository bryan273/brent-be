Boats have been found that are thousands of years old. One of the oldest is in the Sutton Hoo burial. Tombs in Egypt have contained ships, and several in China have been found. All of these date from 5,000 to 8,000 years. Because early ships were made of wood very few have been found on the sites of ship wrecks. To date the first ship is impossible.
