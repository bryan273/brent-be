Like previous versions of the Conners’ CPT test, the CPT II Version 5.2 for Windows® employs the unique Conners’ paradigm that has been based on extensive research and theory. The theoretical background and development of the instrument is provided in the CPT II Technical Guide and Software Manual. The standard protocol of the CPT II test uses a short practice exercise prior to the administration of the full test to ensure that the respondent fully understands the task prior to proceeding.
