Pour dye colors over yarn leaving space between each color. Using a rod, poke yarn so dye moves to cover white spaces between colors. The dye will strike quickly because of the heat. Be careful not to overstir because you do not want the colors to migrate any more than necessary to cover the undyed areas of yarn.
