One word that describes life? Wanna share one word that you think describes life from a Buddhist perspective for you and one word that describes life as you see it/experience it - if it differs from the first world. Don't take it too seriously - no-one's going to hold you too it. But not too many stupid jokes though please. If I want bad jokes I'd go and watch a bad sitcom.
