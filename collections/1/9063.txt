Wild Maine Belon Oysters are an allowable catch in Maine from mid September until mid June – but are premium in October through March with colder water temperatures. Select “farms” in Maine are authorized to harvest year-round, but are a true cottage industry with modest output. With so few harvested a year (estimated at no more than 5,000), the Maine “Belon” is among the rarest oyster available anywhere. Availability is Seasonal and Limited. Two Dozen.
