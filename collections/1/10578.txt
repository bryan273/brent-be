Frameshift mutation (illustration). This type of mutation occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a geneâ€™s reading frame. A reading frame consists of groups of 3 bases that each code for one amino acid.A frameshift mutation shifts the grouping of these bases and changes the code for amino acids. nonsense mutation is also a change in one DNA base pair. Instead of substituting one amino acid for another, however, the altered DNA sequence prematurely signals the cell to stop building a protein. This type of mutation results in a shortened protein that may function improperly or not at all.
