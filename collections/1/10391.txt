Note that the standard deviation did come from the sample. Therefore, this will be a t-interval, as opposed to a Z-interval. For this problem, we have s = 0.32, n = 20, and. (a). Assuming a normal distribution, set up a 95% confidence interval estimate of the average value of all greeting cards in the store. Here, .a). Set up a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion of students who have access to a PC outside the school. Here, . Again, this value is found by drawing a normal curve (by hand) in order to illustrate exactly what we need for this problem. Draw a curve and mark off the middle 90% of the area.
