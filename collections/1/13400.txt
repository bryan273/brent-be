Receiving Your Payments. Your military retired pay will arrive on the first business day of the month following your retirement date. For example, if you retire on Oct. 1 you will receive pay for October on Nov. 1. The safest and most efficient way to receive your pay is through direct deposit or international direct deposit. Direct deposit is the most efficient, timely and secure way to receive your pay.
