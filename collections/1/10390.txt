Summary: 1  The formula for calculating a confidence interval for a mean is : $\bar{x} \pm z (\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$. 2  We can only use the formula $\bar{x} \pm z (\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})$ for quantitative data. 3  We use the t-distribution for sample sizes of normal data with $n \leq 30$.hen we calculate a z-score, we want to look at how many standard deviations away from the mean our data point falls. A confidence interval relies on a similar principle. We want to estimate how many standard errors our sample mean falls from the true population mean on the sampling distribution.
