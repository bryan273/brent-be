The level of performance at Champs is extremely impressive. 18-year-old Zharnel Hughes from Anguilla won the 100m in 10.12 (+1.3), Jamaica’s 19-year-old Javon Francis, already a world medallist in the 4x400m relay, clocked a world-leading 45.00 in the 400m, breaking Usain Bolt’s meeting record of 45.43.
