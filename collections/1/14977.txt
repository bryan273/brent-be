Due to the recent expectations of launch, the SALT token has been increasing in price for the last month. Hitting a low of around $3.50, SALT is currently trading at $16.50 on Binance. Expectations are for the upward 30s due to needing the SALT token for a variety of services, not just lending. Currently, SALTLending has a shop that accepts SALT tokens as payment.
