Typically a 4-7 year old will need a bike with either 14 or 16 wheels. This covers heights between 105cm and 118cm. As with 12 wheeled bikes, these come with stabilisers, coaster brakes and/or independent front and rear hand operated brakes. They also have rubber tyres and inner tubes for a smoother ride.
