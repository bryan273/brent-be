We strive for accuracy with the following prices, however, the prices posted at our recycling center are what we pay if there is any discrepancy. Ask about bonuses over 200 pounds. All prices are in cents per pound unless noted. All prices below are for clean metal, unless listed as contaminated. In order to be graded as clean all metals must be free of steel, plastics, or other contaminants.
