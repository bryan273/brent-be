he probably doesn't view it as a bed. i crate trained my dog before he got his own bed. so he needs a crate, with nothing in it, trust me he'll be fine, and untill about 6-9 months he should sleep in there. when he is confined to a small area they won't poop or pee in that area. they can't get away from it if they do.f you don't want him to do that, just keep training him, If he does a good job, praise him. If he does a bad job, scold him. Yoiu shold get the game, Nintendogs for the DS, and Dogz 1, Dogz 2 for GBA. It gives you training. A lot! Its good for dog owners.
