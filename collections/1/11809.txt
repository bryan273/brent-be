Special to The Oregonian. Like most condiments, mayonnaise by itself isn't very useful. But in the company of meat, vegetables or bread, mayonnaise is priceless. Without it, egg salad is just eggs; crab cakes, just crab; a BLT, just a naked lettuce leaf and few strips of bacon and tomato slices on dry toast. Even people who don't like mayonnaise need mayonnaise sometimes.
