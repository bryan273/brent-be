Cut garden flowers early in the morning. Flowers that are cut on a hot day won't last as long because the heat of the sun draws moisture away from the petals. 3. The ideal temperature for flowers is between 40ºF and 50ºF. Store your flowers in your fridge overnight will make them last longer. If they won't fit in your fridge, place them on the floor in the coolest room in your house at night. 4. Remove all leaves from the part of the stem that is submerged under water.
