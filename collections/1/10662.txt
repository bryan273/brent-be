The term comes from the Greek word mimos, meaning imitator. Early Greek mime is thought to have originated in about 581 BC in Megara; it had some basic dialogue but emphasized physical action. Surviving examples of Greek mime are mainly burlesques of myths or satirical playlets about domestic situations.
