Rapid sand filtration is a purely physical drinking water purification method. Rapid sand filters (RSF) provide rapid and efficient removal of relatively large suspended particles. Two types of RSF are typically used: rapid gravity and rapid pressure sand filters. For the provision of safe drinking water, RSFs require adequate pre-treatment (usually coagulation-flocculation) and post-treatment (usually disinfection with chlorine).
