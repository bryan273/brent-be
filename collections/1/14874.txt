Web posted at: 4:15 p.m. EST. LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Dean Martin, the laid-back crooner, comedian and actor, died Monday. His agent said he died of acute respiratory failure. He was 78. Though best known for the 51 films he made, Martin was a prize-fighter, steel mill laborer, gas station attendant and card shark before seeing the first glimmer of fame. It came when he teamed up with comedian Jerry Lewis in 1946.
