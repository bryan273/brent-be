Paul Revere made not one but two depictions of the Boston Massacre. The first one was perhaps the most recognized symbol of the American Revolution. It was published under the long name “The Bloody Massacre perpetrated in King Street, Boston on March 5th 1770 by a party of the 29th Regiment”. It is believed that the image was originally created by a different artist Henry Pelham.
