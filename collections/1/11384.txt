1. Fresh Meat Specials. While I’m not a big meat eater, my family does enjoy meat meals from time to time. Each Wednesday ALDI offers a special “Fresh Meat Special Buy.” Some weeks it’s brisket, some weeks it’s chicken breasts ($1.89 a pound!!), but usually it’s top cuts of meat at really low prices.
