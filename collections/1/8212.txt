The taxes currently raise $5.1 million for the county litter grants program under TDOT's Beautification Office. Most of this funds litter pickup by county jail inmates (they get two days off their sentence for each day spent picking up litter). The rest goes to litter education or to Keep Tennessee Beautiful.
