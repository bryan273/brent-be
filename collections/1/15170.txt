Sometimes fibroids can be found in the cervix. The outer layer fibroids can make the uterus enlarged and distorted, and the inner fibroids can cause heavy bleeding when a woman is menstruating. The fibroids are affected by womenâ€™s hormones: estrogen and progesterone. African-American women seem to be more susceptible to fibroids.
