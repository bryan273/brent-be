Renew a Passport by Mail Step 1: Apply Early. If you are renewing your passport using Passport Renewal Application Form DS-82, Post Offices do not need to review or process your application. You can mail your renewal application directly to the State Department yourself. Adult passports are valid for 10 years and may be renewed by mail.
