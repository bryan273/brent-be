Arrange the meat strips side-by-side across the racks, leaving at least 1/4-inch of space between strips. Place the racks of meat in the oven and cook until completely dry. This can take as little as 2 hours and as long as 5 hours, depending on the thickness and moistness of the meat, and how chewy you want it to be. The jerky will firm up as it cools.
