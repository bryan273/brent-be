NO More tyson products in our house and also speaking for the rest of my family. The tyson corp. in Shelbyville Tennessee has elected to trade out Labor Day for the last day of Ramadan week for a paid Holiday. Ramadan is a Muslim Holiday so let's observe Muslim Holidays not United States Hoildays. NO MORE TYSON FOOD! I hate the way that Tyson stalls when they are in the wrong. My vehicle was hit by a Tyson truck driven by Jose. He ran a red light and totaled my vehicle with my daughter in it. She was taken from the scene in an ambulance to a hospital for treatment and now goes to rehabilitation.
