Not a good indicator. The many health benefits of garlic are derived from Allicin, not alliin (pronounced Alâ€™-ee-in). Alliin is a precursor compound to Allicin. Allicin conversion depends on the amount and activity of the converting enzyme allinase and alliin.On its own, alliin is only of limited value.one of these products contain any Allicin. Dried garlic powder contains both the allinase and alliin (precursor to Allicin) but not Allicin (1).On an equivalent weight, dry garlic powder has a higher level of alliin (3x) than fresh garlic.
