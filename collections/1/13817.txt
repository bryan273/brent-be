Other examples of registry-hosting websites include Blueprint, Simple Registry, CheckedTwice, My Registry, Zola, All My Gifts, and Knack. While most of these websites are free, some charge a small fee. Keep in mind that the website you use to host your registry is separate from your wedding website.
