There are twenty recognized isotopes of sodium, ranging from 18Na to 37Na and two isomers (22mNa and 24mNa). 23Na is the only stable (and the only primordial) isotope. As such, it is considered a monoisotopic element and it has a standard atomic mass: 7001229897692800000♠22.98976928(2) u. Sodium has two radioactive cosmogenic isotopes (22Na, half-life = 2.605 years; and 24Na, half-life ≈ 15 hours). With the exception of those two, all other isotopes have half-lives under a minute, most under a second. The least stable is 18Na, with a half-life of 6979129999999999999♠1.3(4)×10−21 seconds.
