Students have different socio-economic backgrounds, religious beliefs, and family structures. Each student has his own individual personality, interests, and abilities. People from different corners of the world can be seen in the same classroom. Many educators, in response to this, and because they recognize and welcome the bounty of cultures that are present in their diverse classrooms, make efforts to embrace multicultural teaching using culturally responsive instruction.
