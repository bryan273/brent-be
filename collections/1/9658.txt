Jerry O’Connell, who was a serious contender to become the new co-host during Ripa’s last search, returns for his 13th time as a guest host. Morris Chestnut, from Fox’s Rosewood, and Central Intelligence star Kevin Hart will make their debuts as guest co-hosts. Ripa continues her search for a replacement for Michael Strahan, who exited Live last month to join Good Morning America full-time.
