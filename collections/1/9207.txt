Homeowner Associations, HOAs, get hazard and liability insurance for certain areas of condominium projects. However, home owners must understand what HOA insurance covers and what it does not protect. Usually, HOA insurance covers common areas and, often, the exterior elements, such as roofs, of condo units. HOA insurance seldom protects interior components of units, such as walls, any household goods or personal property.
