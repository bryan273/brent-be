The word 'beans' is purposefully in single quote marks, since what gets roasted and ground to make coffee is not really a bean at all, it is a seed. In particular, it is the seed of a fruit that grows on trees that can easily reach twenty feet or more. Some wild varieties grow to over forty five feet or fifteen metres.
