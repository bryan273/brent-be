Measurement of lung volumes provides a tool for understanding normal function of the lungs as well as disease states. The breathing cycle is initiated by expansion of the chest. Contraction of the diaphragm causes it to flatten downward. If chest muscles are used, the ribs expand outward. The resulting increase in chest volume creates a negative pressure that draws air in through the nose and mouth. Normal exhalation is passive, resulting from “recoil” of the chest wall, diaphragm, and lung tissue. In normal breathing at rest, approximately one-tenth of the total lung capacity is used.
