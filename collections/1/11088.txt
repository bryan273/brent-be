Dr. Lustig clarifies the point. Fructose, he argues, is a poison. And our sugar consumption, and therefore our overall consumption of this poison went from less than half a pound to 56 pounds per person per year in about 30 years. Our obesity levels skyrocketed during those same 30 years. As did our incidence of diseases like metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and even cancer.
