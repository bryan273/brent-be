1 Most of the county lies between the River Shannon and its major tributary, the River Suck. Athlone on the Shannon is the main point of entry to the county; north of it lies Lough (Lake) Ree and, farther upstream, Loughs Bofin and Boderg. 2  The area is greatly dependent on agriculture, though there is some light industry.
