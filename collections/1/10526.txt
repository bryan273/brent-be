In fact, Mars has an orbit much more eccentric than the Earth's, and its perihelion cycle (which has a period of 51,000 years) does apparently have a significant effect on climate and prevailing wind direction there.he two effects — the precession of the axis of rotation and the change in the orbit's orientation — work together to shift the seasons with respect to perihelion. Because we use a calendar year that is aligned to the occurrence of the seasons, the date of perihelion gradually regresses through the year.
