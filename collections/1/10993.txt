With that reality is not just the visual but the feel, taste, and smell of the event. So when you see a beautiful bouquet, remember that it comes with its own unique smell that may be lovely or gag-worthy depending on your choices. The olfactory system is a peculiar one. Some flowers that make me outright sick with their smell* are often cited as being “sweet”, “fragrant”, or “soft”. These sources clearly don’t smell them the way I do! One example would be boxwood bushes. To me they smell just like cat urine but other people love them.
