Some types of mold are commonly known as mildew. Mold may live indoors or outdoors and thrives in damp, warm, and humid environments. Although shower stalls and basements are typical moist areas prone to the growth of molds, any moist area in the household may harbor mold. Allergic reactions to mold are the most common health effects and risks of mold.
