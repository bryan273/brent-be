A plastic material, such as clay, also possess some degree of rigidity. However, the critical shear stress at which it yields is relatively small, and once this stress is exceeded the material deforms continuously and irreversibly, and does not recover its original shape when the stress is relieved.By definition, a fluid material possesses no rigidity at all.In other words, a small fluid element is unable to withstand any tendency of an applied shear stress to change its shape. Incidentally, this does not preclude the possibility that such an element may offer resistance to shear stress. Fluids are isotropic media: i.e. , there is no preferred direction in a fluid. 2  Fluids are Newtonian: i.e. , there is a linear relationship between the local shear stress and the local rate of strain, as first postulated by Newton.
