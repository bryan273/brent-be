Costs in the coverage gap. Most Medicare Prescription Drug Plans have a coverage gap (also called the donut hole). This means there's a temporary limit on what the drug plan will cover for drugs. Not everyone will enter the coverage gap. The coverage gap begins after you and your drug plan have spent a certain amount for covered drugs. In 2017, once you and your plan have spent $3,700 on covered drugs, you're in the coverage gap.
