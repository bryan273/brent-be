Last Friday was Christmas Eve. We were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the snow for Christmas here in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The weather forecasters told us that this would be the first White Christmas for Atlanta since 1882, we are 100 miles north of Atlanta so a White Christmas in Blue Ridge was a “sure thing”. Christmas morning, I awoke to no snow so I quickly checked the radar to find our where our snow was.
