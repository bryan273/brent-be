Detergents carried in on swimsuits are a common cause of foamy hot tub water. Lotions, hair care products and other body products can also cause foamy water. However, foamy water may also be a sign of low sanitizer levels. To reduce or prevent foamy hot tub water, stick to a careful water maintenance program. It’s also a good idea to rinse guests’ swimsuits before a dip in the hot tub.
