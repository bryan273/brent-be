If you're looking for the right way to moisturize a dry scalp, know that the answer doesn't always lie with shampoos and conditioners. Scalp oils help to moisturize your scalp, and they can even work better than moisturizing products do in some cases. Your body keeps your skin moisturized naturally by secreting oil called sebum through glands in your skin. However, sometimes the skin doesn't produce as much sebum as it should, which leads to dryness.
