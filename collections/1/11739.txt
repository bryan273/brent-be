To complete the menu, serve with ice-cold beer, a big pitcher of iced tea, a roll of paper towels, and any combo of these complementary sides: Often, corn on the cob gets boiled with the shrimp, but we like the upgrade of Grilled and Dilled Corn on the Cob—an elevated, herby take on Mexican elote. Step up the potato game with Baby Potatoes with Arugula Pesto. You can make them ahead and serve cold—offering a cooling break from the spicy cocktail sauce.
