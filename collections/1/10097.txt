1 For severe stains, add 1-2 cups vinegar to the wash cycle as well. 2  To remove a rust stain from your cotton work clothes, moisten the spot with some full-strength vinegar and then rub in a bit of salt. 3  If itâ€™s warm outdoors, let it dry in the sunlight (otherwise a sunny window will do), then toss it in the wash.
