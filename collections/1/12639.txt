In 1761 de Morveau proposed the name alumine for the base in alum. In 1807, Davy proposed the name alumium for the metal, undiscovered at that time, and later agreed to change it to aluminum. Shortly thereafter, the name aluminium was adopted by IUPAC to conform with the ium ending of most elements. Aluminium is the IUPAC spelling and therefore the international standard.
