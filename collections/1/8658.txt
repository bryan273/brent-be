The Bump Key. A bump key is required for lock bumping to be effective. The key must be the appropriate size for the lock, but the only other requirement is that each ridge in the key is cut to maximum depth. People often refer to bump keys as “999 keys” because each ridge is cut to a depth of nine in a key-making machine.
