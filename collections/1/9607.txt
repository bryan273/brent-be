The statute of limitation is 5-7 years in Illinois, but I moved to Oklahoma and the statute there is 3-5 years. Now since the loan originated in Illinois, do I go by the statute in illinois, or since the crediting company is calling from Oklahoma, where I reside now, do I go by statute of limitations in Oklahoma.
