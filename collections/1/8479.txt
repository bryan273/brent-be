I've had doctors say it's ok to drink coffee while sick, some say other wise. 99% of the time people recommend tea. I'm just curious to what reddit thinks. If you're a coffee addict, you should definitely drink your normal amount. Definitely, an irritable sick person with a headache is no fun. There is powder caffeine for this purpose if you really need your fix but for a true coffee addict, nothing but the elixir itself will do.
