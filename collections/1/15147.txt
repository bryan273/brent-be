The most important thing to remember about p-value is that it is used to test hypotheses. It is a measure of how much evidence we have against the null hypothesis, which is the hypothesis of no change or no difference. The smaller the p-value, the more evidence we have against the null hypothesis. Very often, a p-value less than 0.05 leads us to conclude that there is evidence against the null hypothesis and we say that we reject the same at 5%.
