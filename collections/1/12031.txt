But, that doesnâ€™t mean students have to take them all in the same week. Our class structure allows us to provide 5 cycles of classes for every 30-day period. As long as students take the classes in order, (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4), they are free to switch between any of the cycles for that 30-day period. The only other requirement is that all 4 classes must be completed within 30 days of the first class.
