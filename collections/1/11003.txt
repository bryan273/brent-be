Sterilisation is a permanent method of contraception that a woman can choose if she is sure that she does not want children in the future. The two main sterilisation procedures are tubal ligation, where clips are put on the fallopian tubes, and tubal occlusion, where a tiny, flexible device called a micro-insert (EssureTM) is put into each tube. Tubal occlusion does not involve having surgery.
