A sheet cake is primarily 16 inches by 24 inches big. Since that size is not practical for smaller parties, smaller sizes are also available. There is a half sheet cake, which is 12 inches by 16 inches big and a quarter sheet cake, which is 8 inches by 12 inches big. The commercial quarter sheet cake is slightly smaller than the standard homemade sheet cake, which is about 9 inches by 13 inches.
