1 Body markings are also a good way to name a cat. 2  Try to give your cat a name with two or three syllables, because you will, believe it or not, end up shortening your kitty's name. 3  If you name him Sandwich, you will start calling him San, and that's not a great name.f the children want to name the kitten after himself/herself, you might not want to take him/her up on his suggestion. But if your sister or brother thinks of Peanuts, for example, that's not a bad name.
