Sunshine dominating much of the East Coast today will soon be replaced by an expanding area of rain and thunderstorms. The culprits behind the impending unsettled weather are Tropical Storm Alberto, another low off the East Coast and an eastward-moving cold front that is threatening the Plains with severe weather.
