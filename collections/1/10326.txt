This will create the perfect environment for tenderizing the ribs. I wrap my ribs for 2 hours at 225; be sure to check them at 1:45 minutes. You want to unwrap a slab and gentle tug on a few of the middle bones.If they feel like they will pull out with little or know effort, you have them right where you want them. Carefully remove the slabs from the smoker and vent each. You have to be careful not to move the ribs to much or they can fall apart.
