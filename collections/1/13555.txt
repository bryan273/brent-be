Native Command Queuing (NCQ) Definition - What does Native Command Queuing (NCQ) mean? Native command queuing (NCQ) is a technology enabling SATA hard drives to accept more than one command at a time by optimizing the order in which read and write commands are executed. This increases the performance of the drive by limiting the number of drive head movements when multiple read/write requests are queued.
