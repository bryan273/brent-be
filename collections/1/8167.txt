This reader wanted to know the best way to find the optic nerve center, which is normally the brightest spot of the retinal image. To find the brightest spot of the image using Python and OpenCV, you would utilize the cv2.minMaxLoc function. However, the term “spot” here is a little misleading. The “brightest spot” of the image according to cv2.minMaxLoc actually isn’t a region — it’s simply the brightest single pixel in the entire image.
