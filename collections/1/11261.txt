Happy Memorial Day Weekend! We had a special treat today at Anovia Payments. Carlos Gonzalez, a Cyber Security expert who spent 9 years working in psychological ops as part of U.S. Army Special Operations spoke to our team about honor, training, strategy, contingency, and commitment to excellence. Thank you so much Carlos.
