About Transcutaneous Pacing. Transcutaneous pacing is the technique of electrically. stimulating the heart externally by using a set of electrode pads. This technique is not as efficient as transvenous pacing. because the electrical stimulus (the pads) is not in direct contact. with the heart muscle. Transcutaneous pacing is a good. temporary solution in an emergency situation to improve a slow. heart rate resulting in inadequate cardiac output.
