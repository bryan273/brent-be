1 Small residential projects tend to cost more per square foot and may be subject to a minimum charge of $500-$1,000 or more. 2  Resurfacing an average 500-square-foot concrete driveway typically costs $2,000-$5,000. ThisOldHouse.com estimates it took two people five hours and six bags ($150-$180) of material to resurface a 9'x27' driveway and a 3'x18' walkway (about 300 square feet). 2  Renting a pressure washer to clean the existing concrete before resurfacing can add $40-$75 to the total DIY costs.
