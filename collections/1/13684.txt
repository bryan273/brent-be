Dr. Curtis Knox is played by Dean Cain, who played Clark Kent/Superman in Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Dr. Curtis Knox's initials are C.K, just like Clark Kent's. This is an homage to Dean Cain's role as Clark Kent on Lois and Clark (on that show, C.K is what Jimmy Olsen called Clark Kent ). Knox's powers and abilities are similar to those of Vandal Savage, infamous DC Comics immortal, who often used aliases.
