Every state has a statute of limitations (SOL) that limits how long a creditor or debt collector can successfully collect a debt. Typically, the statute of limitations starts when you miss your first payment with the original creditor. It does not start when the account was placed for collection. If a debt collector tried to sue you after this time period has expired, you can raise the SOL as a defense against the lawsuit. Many consumers confuse the length of time that debts can appear on their credit reports with the debt collection statute of limitations.
