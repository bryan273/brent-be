Detox, short for detoxification, is the body's natural, ongoing process of neutralizing and eliminating toxins. Toxins are substances that can potentially harm body tissue, such as waste products that result from normal cell activity (like ammonia, lactic acid, and homocysteine) and chemicals that we are exposed to in our environment, food, and water.
