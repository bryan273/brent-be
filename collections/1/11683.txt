Learning to talk is a slow process, and it can take a long time to establish a large enough vocabulary for meaningful conversations. Most children say their first words between 11 and 14 months of age. Popular first words include ‘mama' and ‘dada', but could be any word she has heard often enough. By 16 months, girls can say an average of 50 words, and boys have a vocabulary of around 30.
