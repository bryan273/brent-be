As a matter of fact, those are coffee beans! Many people picture coffee as brown, dry beans that grow from the ground. Instead, coffee is a “cherry” that grows from plants that range anywhere from 5-7 feet tall (but our Q Grader, Paul, has seen coffee plants up to 18 feet tall! That’s a whole lot of coffee!). Coffee plants almost resemble small Christmas trees.
