We describe and categorize different types of matter by referring to its physical or chemical properties. Physical properties are the traits of an object that can be readily seen such as size, color and state. Measuring or changing these properties does not affect the chemical nature of the matter. For example, a paper that is cut into small pieces has undergone a physical change. The pieces have a different quantity, size, shape and texture than the original sheet. Chemical properties are the characteristics that describe the composition of matter.
