When you add the potassium hydroxide it will sound like it is going to explode or boil over, but the water does not bubble up at all and it doesnt even heat us as much as sodium hydroxide so dont worry.. One more note, I am one of those risk taking soapers who doesnt even wear gloves when making soap.
