Almond Milk. Depending on where you shop and whether you have coupons, regular milk can be found for a little cheaper at other grocery stores. Though ALDIâ€™s $.99 gallon of regular milk is priced pretty darn well, their almond milk is $2.49 or less, which is great buy. It can be over a dollar more at many other stores.
