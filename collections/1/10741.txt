The Paiute people were both hunters and gatherers. Depending on the season they would gather different plants. Some seeds and berries were found in the winter, although bulbs and roots were plentiful in the spring while pinion crop was bountiful in the fall. Their protein came from insects. Because there were'nt many big game in the Paiute land they would hunt smaller things like ground squirrels and occasionally trap a rabbit. RESOURCES F
