Seafood should be frozen rapidly. First, thoroughly pre-chill the seafood. Research has shown that rapid freezing results in the best quality of the seafood. Make sure that the temperature of the freezer is around 0°F (-18°C). Put the seafood in small packages and spread them out to allow cold air circulation around them until frozen.
