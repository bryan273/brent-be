Unlike many health conditions that develop silently inside the body, pediatric torticollis is easy to see from the outside. You can recognize it when your child’s head persistently tilts to one side. The word “torticollis” itself comes from two Latin root words, “tortus” and “collum,” that together mean “twisted neck.” This condition, sometimes called wryneck, is relatively common in children.
