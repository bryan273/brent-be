We surveyed readers in different parts of the country who had been arrested for a first-offense DUI to find out how much they paid to resolve their case. Here, we discuss the average costs these readers reported. This information can give you an idea of how much you can expect to pay for a first DUI, but there are lots of variables that affect costs. For instance, fines and fees vary by state. And first DUIs involving a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) or an accident can end up costing more than other first offenses.
