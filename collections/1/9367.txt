Estimated Arrival and Price: Watch for the Aventador SV to be unveiled at the Geneva auto show in March before going on sale later in the year as a 2016 model. Prices are unknown, of course, but anything that Lamborghini calls “super fast” is always super expensive. Don’t be surprised if the SV’s price eclipses that of the $500,000 50th Anniversary Aventador by at least $100K. View Photos View Photos.
