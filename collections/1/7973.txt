Can anyone confirm if Feign Death + Potion of Deepholm = bubble-hearth? I assume you've abandoned/killed off your pet in desperation and your Feign Death has not been resisted, leaving you out of combat...just long enough to chug a Potion of Deepholm? The perfect cost-effective case: you're about to die in the last seconds of Tol Barad and have no interest in waking up with rez sickness outside The Crossroads.
