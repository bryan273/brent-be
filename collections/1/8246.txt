Region covered by area codes 601 and 769. Area codes 601 and 769 are the telephone area codes for central Mississippi. The main area code, 601, was one of the original area codes implemented in 1947, and served all of Mississippi.n 1999, area code 662 was created in the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi side of the Memphis area. The 1999 split was intended as a long-term solution, but within five years 601 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones, particularly in the Jackson area.
