Can having your tubes tied cause early menopause? Has anyone ever heard of having your tubes tied causing early menopausal symptoms? Tubal ligation should not cause menopause in an of itself BUT, there is a temporary sydrome that comes along with tubal ligation that can create/cause menopausal symptoms. It is usually short lived and goes away on its own.
