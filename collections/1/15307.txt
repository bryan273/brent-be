When it comes to finishing an entire house, a carpenter might charge in the region of $3.00 to $3.50 per square foot for doing the basic interior trim, internal doors, window frames, baseboards and other internal fittings in a home, which would probably come to around $3,250 to $4,000 for an average house.
