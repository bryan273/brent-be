Revenge of the Mummy is a not-to-be-missed high-speed, indoor roller coaster similar to Disney’s Rock ‘n Rollercoaster (except you do not go upside down on The Mummy). The attraction does a fantastic job of bringing The Mummy story to life with plenty of thrills and personality. Revenge of the Mummy at Universal Studios Florida. Fear factor. 4 out of 5.
