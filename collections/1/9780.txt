It™s called a ﬁkilogram-mole,ﬂ and is the number of atoms in 12. kilograms of Carbon-12. So by definition, there would be 12 kg in one kmol of Carbon-12. You can probably predict what the lbmol is. It™s called a ﬁpound-mole,ﬂ and is the number of. atoms in 12 pounds (mass) of Carbon-12. So again, by definition, there are 12 lbm in one lbmol of. Carbon-12. Thus we can see that the values of the atomic or molecular masses are the same, whether the units. are g/mol, kg/kmol or lbm/lbmol.
