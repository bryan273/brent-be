Spread sand over the top of the pavers and brush sand into the joints with a broom. Repeat compacting and filling joints with sand until they have been filled and the pavers are tightly secured. After you have placed and compacted the pavers and filled the joints with sand, you have completed your dry-laid paver patio.
