Parts of an Angle. The corner point of an angle is called the vertex. And the two straight sides are called arms. The angle is the amount of turn between each arm. How to Label Angles. There are two main ways to label angles: 1. give the angle a name, usually a lower-case letter like a or b, or sometimes a Greek letter like α (alpha) or θ (theta) 2. or by the three letters on the shape that define the angle, with the middle letter being where the angle actually is (its vertex).
