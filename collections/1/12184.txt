This 2015 Volkswagen Passat on the other hand is the newest car in the parking lot at work. It is the only Volkswagen in the parking lot at work and it is the ONLY car in the parking lot at work that sounds like squeaky the train when it leaves the parking lot every day. This is embarrassing and unacceptable.
