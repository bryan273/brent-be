Approximately 1 billion trees worth of paper are thrown away every year in the U.S. Every ton of paper recovered for recycling is a ton that doesnâ€™t go to the landfill and saves 17 trees. At Vanish Document Shredding Houston we contribute to the conservation of our environment by recycling all Documents when possible.
