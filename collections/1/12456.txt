Lorazepam is considered a high-potency benzodiazepine with an intermediate half life. Most therapeutic effects wear off within 6-8 hours. This is why doctors prescribe multiple doses of lorazepam daily for acute episodes of anxiety. But the amount of time lorazepam effects last can depend on its mode of administration.
