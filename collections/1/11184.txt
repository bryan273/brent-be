There are numerous, minute openings present on the leaves, called stomata, through which gaseous exchange takes place between the atmosphere and the plant body. C. Evaporation of water. Water absorbed by the root hairs of the plant is evaporated from the leaf surface during the day time. It generÂ­ally takes place through the stomatal openings. The phenomenon is known as transpiration. This process allows the plant to absorb water and minerals from the soil and conduct the same to the top of the plant. D. Storage of food. Fleshy leaves of Indian aloe, Portulaca and fleshy scale leaves of onion store food materials and water for the future of the plants.
