Best Answer: There are only certain parts of the cardiac cycle in which the atria will have higher pressure than the ventricles. During diastole, the atria have a higher blood pressure than the ventricles to allow for passive filling of the ventricle with blood. 70% of the filling of the ventricle is done simply using the higher atrial pressure before the atria contract. Atrial contraction does the remaining 30% of filling.
