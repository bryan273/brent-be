The Synod questioned Da'an's capability but removed Zo'or from the position when it became clear that Da'an could not have known about the Doors conspiracy ( Resurrection ). Zo'or was later appointed the Taelon Ambassador to the United Nations, a role previously filled by Da'an. This was ostensibly because the Synod wanted Da'an to focus on his duties as the North American Companion.
