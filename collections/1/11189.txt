Likewise, the oxygen that plant leaves give off is essential to the continuing existence of animals and other aerobic organisms. An important feature of leaves is the presence of stomata or stomates (sing. stoma). Each stoma consists of a tiny pore surrounded by two specialized, sausage-shaped epidermal cells called guard cells. These tiny pores open and close to regulate the passage of gases and water to and from the leaves.
