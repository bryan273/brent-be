In geology texts, the Mesozoic Era, which began some 250 million years ago (mya), is usually called the Age of Reptiles.. It is divided into three periods, the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous (see Table 9.1). In the typical description, encountered in texts on geology, paleontology, and evolutionary biology, it is the era during which reptiles dominated life on earth until their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous Period, 65 million years ago..
