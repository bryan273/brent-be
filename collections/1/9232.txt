The anion after the second dissociation, HPO42–, is the hydrogen phosphate anion. The anion after the third dissociation, PO43–, is the phosphate or orthophosphate anion. For each of the dissociation reactions shown above, there is a separate acid dissociation constant, called K a1, K a2, and K a3 given at 25°C.
