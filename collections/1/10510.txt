Didn't get to the restaurant, but the hotel room was super nice. Lovely view from the small back patio (complete with 2 director's chairs!). Mini-fridge and microwave. Nice sized bathroom, and a single double bed, plus bunk beds with a double on the bottom and single on top. My only (very minor) complaints were the bed was too soft for my back (but that's my issue) and the t.v. didn't work without the picture flipping (but again, not a huge deal).
