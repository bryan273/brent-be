One sign of a possible problem is a change in the color of the toenail. Discoloration of the toenails may be due to a variety of reasons. Once the underlying cause is determined, treatment can be administered to restore normal color to the nail. A fungal infection causes a toenail to become discolored. The nail usually turns a dark color from dirt or debris that has become trapped underneath the nail. Other symptoms of fungal infection include a foul smell, thickened nail, crumbled nail or a dull toenail that is misshapen.
