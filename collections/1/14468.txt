They are also known as the black truss markings. They provide a quick visual for the tape user and speed up the measuring process. Originally, 19.2 inches was used in metric layouts. Dividing 5 into 96 inches (8 feet) gives 19.2 inches, which yields five trusses per sheet. The black arrow in the photo to the right points directly at the black diamond located on 19.2. The red stud markings every 16 inches allow for a standard layout of six studs per 8-foot (96) section.
