Since this is a confidence interval for the proportion, it will be a Z-interval. For this problem, we have n = 150, and p s = 135/150 = .9. (a). Set up a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion of students who have access to a PC outside the school.Here, . Again, this value is found by drawing a normal curve (by hand) in order to illustrate exactly what we need for this problem. Draw a curve and mark off the middle 90% of the area.a).
