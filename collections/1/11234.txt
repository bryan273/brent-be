Those who know much about Wilson Combat are very aware of the long wait times for their pistols. I have orders that are over 24 months old & haven't been started yet. There's a way to cut you wait WAY DOWN!!! I've got so many guns on order...I'm talking LOTS OF GUNS!!! Many of them are custom orders.
