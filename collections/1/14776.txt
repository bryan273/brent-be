Historical Sketch. Steak n Shake was founded by Gus Belt in Normal in 1934. He converted a gas station / chicken restaurant into the first Steak n Shake with counter seating. The restaurant was so popular, the chain expanded around Central Illinois and eventually into other Midwestern states throughout the 1930s.
