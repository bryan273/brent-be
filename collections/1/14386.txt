In 2007, Mr. Muir built a similarly sleek aquarium for a couple in Chelsea. At first, the 900-gallon tank held a lone shark â€” her name was Ursula. When she died, she was replaced by multiple sharks that eventually outgrew the tank and were donated to the New York Aquarium in Coney Island. Today, the occupants are more than a dozen fish of different sizes and shapes.
