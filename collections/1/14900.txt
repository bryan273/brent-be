I dont have my dipstick in front of me but I believe the hash marks end just above the last hole. That is the full mark. If you are above that, you are overfilled. Maybe put 5 quarts in next time and then add as needed.If it's way above, I'd probably drain some out.osted. Yea, i used the fram 10060 filled it on the bench and it ate about 1/2 of quart installed that then poured the other 5.5 quarts into the motor just seems a little weird i have never had a problem with my Gm's before but ive always had the 4.3L before and i know they always take 4.5 quarts.
