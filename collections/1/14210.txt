If you see the Mom cat nearby, DO NOT DISTURB THE KITTENS and let Mom take care of them herself. It is especially crucial for newborn kittens to receive the nutrion from Mom's milk during the first couple of days of their lives. Many kittens will not survive if separated from Mom during the first week of their life.
