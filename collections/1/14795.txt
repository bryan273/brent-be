Slipstream fiction, anyone? I was reading a blog and came across a genre of fiction that I had not heard of before: slipstream fiction. Defined as fiction (both lit and speculative writing) that creates either a surreal effect or cognitive dissonance in the reader... Has anyone else ever heard of this genre?
