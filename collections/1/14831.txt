The reason I used Firefox is because I hated the look and feel of Chrome, Now I need to find a new browser. I use the 64 bit Waterfox, it’s based on firefox’s code. It’s got that old UI and is design by different group of people. Pick your version of Firefox at Filehippo.com – I am going back just to FF 28.
