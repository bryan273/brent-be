So, I went through my iTunes library and made sure that all m4p tracks by that artist had been trashed and deleted, making sure that the tracks I then dragged to the playlist were all standard m4a format. Still no joy. The same warning that some tracks were Apple Music was displayed. i've checked. they're not.
