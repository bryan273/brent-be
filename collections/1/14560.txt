But if you do decide to up the size of your wheels, there are many things to consider. While larger rims look great, they can negatively impact your ride quality and will run pricier than their smaller counterparts. On the other hand, wider wheels can use wider tires, which offer your truck greater traction. This is important if you use your rig for off-roading or other extreme driving conditions. To determine what size tires you would need with your bigger wheels, use a tire size calculator.
