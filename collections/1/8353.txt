From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. §§ 5311–5318) refers to the system of salaries given to the highest-ranked appointed positions in the executive branch of the U.S. government. The President of the United States, an elected official, appoints incumbents to these positions, most of them with the advice and consent of the Senate.
