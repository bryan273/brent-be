Mount Rainier National Park is a unique classroom, rich in resources for observing geologic change. Join us July 17â€“21, 2017, for a 5-day educator workshop in the Park, where we will explore the diverse and dynamic processes that have shaped the volcano and share new classroom ideas that will engage middle school students. There is no charge for this workshop and camping is available to participants.
