Some of the most common experimental designs in the study of cryptomnesia involve solving word puzzles. One such study from Stanford University in 1993 monitored subjectsâ€™ memory for solutions found to a word puzzle game when paired against a computer opponent.he misattribution of memory is therefore more likely to occur as the time between the encoding of an experience and the recall of the subsequent memory increases. It has also been noted that misattribution may be a product of adaptive features of memory, rather than a product of a flaw in the memory system.
