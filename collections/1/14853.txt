A well pump professional typically uses a pump puller machine or a derrick truck to remove the old well piping. A well pump installer provides an installation video for a replacement 3/4 HP submersible pump, while a well owner demonstrates a shallow jet pump used for landscape irrigation. The water system should be disinfected and re-tested after any work is done.
