Posts: n/a. I think Wilson makes a fine semi-custom gun. But, for the money you spend on a Super Grade Wilson, you could have a custom smith build you a custom gun of your own. This would have what YOU want on the gun, and custom finish work, fitting, and detail that a semi production/custom gun will not have.
