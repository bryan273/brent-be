As Jesus came closer to Jerusalem, he asked two of his disciples to go ahead of Him. He said, When you get to the town, you will see a donkey tied up. Untie it, and bring it to me. If anyone asks you about taking the donkey, just tell them, 'The Lord needs it and He will bring it back as soon as He's done with it.'.hen they brought the donkey to Jesus some of the disciples took off their coats and laid them on the donkey's back. They did this out of respect for Jesus. Then Jesus rode on the donkey towards Jerusalem. As He was traveling, some people saw Jesus coming and came running towards Him.
