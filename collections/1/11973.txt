There are two sections of the bowel: the small bowel, also called the small intestine, which is where the nutrients in the food are digested and absorbed; and the colon and rectum form the large bowel, or large intestine, which absorbs water from the digested food, forming it into stools (faeces/poo) that are passed out of the back passage.
