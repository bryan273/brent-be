This is the essence of permaculture - the design of an ecologically sound way of living - in our households, gardens, communities and businesses. It is created by cooperating with nature and caring for the earth and its people. Permaculture is not exclusive - its principles and practice can be used by anyone, anywhere: 1  City flats, yards and window boxes.  Suburban and country houses/garden.
