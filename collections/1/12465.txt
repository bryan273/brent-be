With the new 1.11 update officially hitting Minecraft, llamas are joining its cast of cube animals. They’re great for moving lots of items around, or for farming leather should you decide to massacre a herd. Whichever you’re looking to do, here’s how to find, tame, and use llamas in Minecraft. As of update 1.11, Llamas spawn in the extreme hills and savanna biomes of Minecraft. Keep an eye out for a large herd of white, gray, brown, or tan wool.
