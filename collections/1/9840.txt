Why Do My Armpits Suddenly Smell So Bad? Prepare yourself for a brief history of my armpits. When I was a little kid, few things were better than putting on my mom's deodorant. I loved slathering on my mom's liquid deodorant with the neato roller ball and powder fresh scent. I loved the way the liquid felt slimy and cold on my skin, and that I smelled like a grown up. At that point in my life, deodorant was an extension of playing dress up.
