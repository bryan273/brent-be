One of the hallmarks of lupus are low Complement 3 (C3) and Complement 4 (C4) levels. Low C3 is not specific to lupus; low C3 combined with low C4 is what is usually seen in lupus. The patientâ€™s levels of C3 and C4 can indicate the activity of the disease. 1  When C3 and C4 levels are low, it can suggest that the disease is active and there is either a current flare or a flare is imminent.
