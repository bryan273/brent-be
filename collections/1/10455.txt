Similar to other cities in Arizona and the State of Arizona, Phoenix imposes a transaction privilege (sales) tax on certain business activities. The City tax is in addition to the tax imposed by the State. While the City rate varies by business activity, it is two percent (2.0%) on most activities. A business engaged in taxable activity will need to obtain a transaction privilege (sales) tax license with Phoenix. UPDATE! What's new in TPT-Transaction Privilege (Sales) Tax Simplification?
