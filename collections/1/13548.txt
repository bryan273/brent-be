For 14 years, I have suffered abdominal attacks in my diaframe very high up in the area between my rib cages. The pain mimics pancreatic pain. The pain is so horrible that I almost wish I could die. It usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes, but can be longer. I am paralized during these attacks & can't move. They usually occur 4 to 6 times a year with milder attacks in between the more serious attacks.
