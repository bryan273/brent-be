Justin Bieber is the bullseye of Kevin Hart’s “operation roast everyone’s a--!”. The comedian will be on hand to host the “Comedy Central Roast of Justin Bieber” and add a few verbal jabs to his pal. “I don’t normally do roasts, but I had to step out for my guy Biebs,” Hart said in a statement obtained by E! News.
