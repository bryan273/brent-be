What is torticollis? When a baby is born, one of the exams that the doctor may perform in the hospital is to check for torticollis (which means “twisted neck” in Latin). Congenital torticollis is a muscular problem that is present in an infant at birth. The muscle on one side of the neck is tight and causes the head to tilt to that side. You may also feel a lump on the tight muscle as well.
