Torticollis is a problem involving the muscles of the neck that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck. Sometimes it’s called “wryneck.”. If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis.
