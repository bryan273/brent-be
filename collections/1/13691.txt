Add the product of the multiplication and the number from the dividend and put the result in the next position on the result line. All numbers except the last become the coefficients of the quotient polynomial. The last value in the result line is the remainder. Simplify the quotient polynomial. Since and all of the signs in the bottom row of the synthetic division are positive, is an upper bound for the real roots of the function.
