If a mineral block salt lick was acquired, dig a hole to the depth of the block plus one inch. Set the block in place and lightly cover the block. To initially attract deer to the lick sprinkle some food on the ground above the lick. Over time the lick will dissolve in the ground. Be aware that it takes time to dissolve a mineral salt lick block and some deer will not start using the lick until it dissolves into the soil.
