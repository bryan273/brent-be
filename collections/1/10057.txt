In this example the atomic number is 17 and the mass number is 35. This means that each of these atoms has: 17 protons 17 electrons 35 - 17 = 18 neutrons Isotopes are atoms of an element with the normal number of protons and electrons, but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes have the same atomic number, but different mass numbers. Isotopes can either be radioactive or non-radioactive. For example, 14 C is used in radiocarbon dating to determine the age of historical objects and 99 Tc is used in medical imaging.
