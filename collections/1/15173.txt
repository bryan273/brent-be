3 Comments. 1  Hi Dr. Parker, I would appreciate if you could answer my question. I went into early menopause at the age of 41. 2  I was sitting at the computer when your e-mail came in. You do not need a hysterectomy. 3  I’m 56 and in the same situation as the woman above – finally had my lap myomectomy 4 days ago! Yay!
