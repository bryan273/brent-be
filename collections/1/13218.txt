In the US, three toed sloths are extremely rare but you can have them as pets. They're very expensive, some around $5000. They require very specific care and a strict diet.Yo â€¦ u shouldn't get one unless you have the means to care for it.lso they are supplemented with all natural food and sloth mix. So as long as you can provide them what they need they do make very fun and loving pets. Careful though their nails do get long and can scratch when they go in for the hug! Thirdly I'm not a cat fan so I disagree with his last statement to.
