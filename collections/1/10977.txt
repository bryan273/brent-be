I am 20 years old and 17 weeks pregnant. I got a call from my dr yesterday saying my quad screening test came back positive..with a 1:89 chance my lil girl will have down syndrome..I'm terrified!! Also the day I got the test the dr found a white speck in her heart..does this mean she has down syndrome? everything else measured fine..and looked great said my dr.
