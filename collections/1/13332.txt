Copayment: a fixed sum of money that a consumer pays each time he or she receives a covered service from a plan contracted provider. For example, in many managed care plans, the copayment for a physician office visit is $5 or $10. Cost sharing: the responsibility of a consumer in a managed care plan to pay a portion of the costs for his or her care. Cost sharing can come in three forms: copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance.
