In 2012, a pensioner living on a riverside farm in England killed the largest rat he'd ever seen with a hunk of wood. When he tried to pick it up with a paddle, it broke under the animal's weight. Photographs support the man's claim that it was 4 feet long but are otherwise too blurry to make out much detail.
