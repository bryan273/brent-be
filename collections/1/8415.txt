Normally, I would say that a Republican President would not face any real risk of impeachment from a Republican House of Representatives; the decision to impeach the President (which has only happened twice) is almost entirely partisan. However, Trump isnâ€™t a very normal example of a Republican. It is possible that the Republican House will decide that they like the idea of President Mike Pence enough to find some pretext to impeach President Trump.
