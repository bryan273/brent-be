State Sales Tax: All recreational marijuana purchases are taxed an additional 10% over the standard 2.9% states sales tax. Therefore, the state sales tax on recreational marijuana is 12.90%. City Taxes: Cities assign their own tax rates to recreation marijuana, so the rates will be a bit different everywhere.
