What is SALT Lending? SALT lending is a platform that provides Blockchain-Backed Loans. SALT (Secured Automated Lending Platform) enables you to put up your crypto as collateral in exchange for a cash loan. This is ideal if you need to pay-off an unexpected expense or want to make a big purchase without having to sell-off your blockchain assets.
