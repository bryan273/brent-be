1 Nociceptors (pain nerve endings) are activated by painful stimuli. 2  The resulting pain signal is transmitted by first-order neurons to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 3  Second-order neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain stem, thalamus and other regions of the brain via the ascending pathway.
