Deletion on a chromosome. In genetics, a deletion (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or deletion mutation) (sign: Î´) is a mutation (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is lost during DNA replication.Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome.The smallest single base deletion mutations are believed occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site.ny number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome.
