Vector, in physics, a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is typically represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is proportional to the quantityâ€™s magnitude. Although a vector has magnitude and direction, it does not have position. That is, as long as its length is not changed, a vector is not altered if it is displaced parallel to itself. In contrast to vectors, ordinary quantities that have a magnitude but not a direction are called scalars. For example, displacement, velocity, and acceleration are vector quantities, while speed (the magnitude of velocity), time, and mass are scalars. To qualify as a vector, a quantity having magnitude and direction must also obey certain rules of combination.
