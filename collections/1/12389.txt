“The Divergent Series: Ascendant” was initially scheduled to hit theaters in June 2017, competing with “World War Z 2” and a remake of the original “The Mummy” movie. Filming would have begun this summer, but Lionsgate has since switched up their plans, handing off production to Lionsgate’s television group.
