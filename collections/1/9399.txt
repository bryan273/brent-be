February 8, 2011 2:52:12 PM. I am trying to find info about the history of the Lifetime Warrany that was offered by Rolls-. Royce in the past. When I was in the AF 958-62), there were tales of that unusual offering. and now with the news of people having them for 77 and 82 years it makes me curious. about how well they backed this and what it cost them.
