In January 1982, RuPaul made his first television appearance on “The American Music Show,” which aired on public access. His singing group was called “RuPaul and the U-hauls” and they performed “Shotgun” by Junior Walker and the All Stars. RuPaul, of course, made his two backup singers their costumes.
