Coral reefs often host juvenile fish that live further offshore. They are the basis for the formation of other ecosystems. Indeed, the food of coral formations by the hordes of parrotfish led to the formation of very large tracts of sand and by the action of currents, leads to the formation of shoals, islands and especially in areas prone to the formation of mangroves and other coastal forests.
