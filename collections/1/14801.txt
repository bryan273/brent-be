a book list by Sue Lange, author of slipstream stories. Slipstream is uncomfortably defined as fiction that crosses the divide between mainstream and the speculative literatures of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Personally, I like to think of slipstream as simply weird. It feels weird in a way that's weirder than a standard weird sf/f/h story.
