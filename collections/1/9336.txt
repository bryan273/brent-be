Bright field image of adipocytes from the Cellometer Vision Cell Analyzer Adipocytes are the primary cells found in adipose (fat) tissue. Adipocytes store energy for the body in the form of triacylglycerol and play a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy regulation.Adipocytes have also been found to express a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules capable of inducing inflammation.dipocytes store energy for the body in the form of triacylglycerol and play a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy regulation.
