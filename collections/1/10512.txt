Everyone Is Welcome! OUR MISSION IS HELPING PEOPLE FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO GOD. We’ve seen the transformation hundreds of times – people who came to us full of doubt and uncertainty become secure in the knowledge of their rightful place in God’s great kingdom. The change may start slowly – in a Bible Study class or choir participation, perhaps – but once it begins, it picks up speed.
