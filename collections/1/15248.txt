The term target audience is a bit narrower; it refers specifically to the group of consumers targeted by advertisements. Outside of the context of business, target audience can also refer to the specific group of people targeted by television shows, movies and music products. An advertisement's target audience can be the same as the brand's target market, but a target audience can be more well defined.
