Oats Explained. All oats, including steel-cut and quick oats, start as oat groats, with only the outer husk removed. The main difference between steel-cut oats and quick oats lies in the processing. Steel-cut oats are oat groats that have been cut into two or three pieces, for a relatively unprocessed product.
