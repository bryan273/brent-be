When purchasing meats for jerky, choose lean meats with minimal marbling (fat), as fat tends to get rancid during storage. A lean cut of flank steak or round steak makes excellent jerky. Most lean meats will yield about 1 pound of jerky for 3 pounds of meat. Jerky may be made from a variety of meats including wild game meats, fish and poultry. Use filets of fish and breast of chicken.
