Describe the cell types located in the crypts of Lieberkhan. These intestinal glands are lined by goblet cells and intestinal absorptive cells. Enteroendocrine cells are found along their lateral borders. At the bottom of the gland are Paneth cells (zymogenic cells). The paneth cells contain large granules in their apical cytoplasm which contain zinc and lysozyme.
