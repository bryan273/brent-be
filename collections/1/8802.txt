FHA mortgage insurance premium, or MIP, is a type of insurance policy that protects lenders if an FHA loan holder defaults on his or her mortgage. This insurance allows lenders to issue FHA loans requiring very small down payments and at low rates. FHA MIP reduces lender risk, and the benefits are passed onto the borrower.
