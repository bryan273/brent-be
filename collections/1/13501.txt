Benefits of Dental Implants. 1  Implants offer firm support to man-made teeth. Dentures, bridges or single teeth attached to the implants won't slip or shift in your mouth-a very important benefit when eating and speaking. 2  This secure fit also helps man-made teeth feel more natural than typical bridges or dentures.
