Keep In Mind: 1  Above prices include abrasive blasting, masking of all threads, preparation, and powder coating using a stock color. 2  Cast aluminum and magnesium parts may experience an out-gassing and/or bubbling in the finished powder coat. 3  For a second coat add 50% for a clear coat. Clear coat is required over all metal and silver coating. home:: contact:: online store:: the perfect coat:: photo gallery:: color charts:: shipping info:: price lists:: links
