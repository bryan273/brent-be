Put some food and water out for Mom, so she can devote herself to her babies. Contact your local Humane Society or a Feral Cat Rescue Group for help and information on how to trap a feral cat family. Remember - Mom and her babies need to be spay/ neutered to avoid creating a new feral cat colony in your neighborhood. Follow these guidelines if Mom is not around. | Back to Top |.
