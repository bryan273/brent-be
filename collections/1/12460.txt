What do you do with a llama? There are many uses for a llama, but the first consideration to owning llamas should be a love of animals and the enjoyment of being around them. Llamas are by nature very intelligent, gentle, and quiet animals. They are relatively inexpensive to maintain, and are cooperative and patient in training. There are seven main uses for a llama: A) breeding animals as a source of income. B) a packing beast of burden. C) a source of wool.
