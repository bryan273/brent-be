Phosphorus is a chemical element with symbol P and atomic number 15. As an element, phosphorus exists in two major forms— white phosphorus and red phosphorus —but due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth. Instead phosphorus-containing minerals are almost always present in their maximally oxidised state, as inorganic phosphate rocks.
