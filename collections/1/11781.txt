In an advanced fungal nail infection, a discolored toenail is a minor symptom compared to the thick flaky distorted appearance of the nail and the discomfort of fungal spread to the skin of the toes.ther possible explanations would include a recent blow to the tip of the toe, causing bleeding and blackening under the nail, bacterial growth beneath the nail (often a green color), continuous use of nail polish on the nail, or some other uncommon medical condition. The problem, however, is usually fungus.
