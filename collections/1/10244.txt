• The majority of adverse effects from IVIG are infusion rate-related and usually mitigated by reducing the infusion rate or by interruption of the infusion until symptoms subside. • Premedication with acetaminophen (1000mg) and/or diphenhydramine (50mg) may be useful for mitigating infusion-related adverse effects.
