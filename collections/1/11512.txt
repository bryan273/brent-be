Shocking the pool will lower the pH, whether you use chlorine-based shock (calcium hypochlorite), or the non-chlorine kind (potassium peroxymonosulfate). Rain picks up impurities in the air, raising the rainwater acidity and lowers the pH. Outdoor pools, even ones with pool covers, tend to get some rainwater in them.
