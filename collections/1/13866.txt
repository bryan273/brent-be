According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nursing is one of the most in demand fields in the US, with a job growth of 26% by 2020. To open yourself up to many of those job opportunities, you will need to have at least your BSN. Many of the most financially rewarding careers in nursing only are open to those with a graduate nursing degree, which you only can obtain by first getting your BSN.
