Note that the standard deviation did not come from the sample. Therefore, this will be a Z-interval, as opposed to a t-interval. For this problem, we have, n = 100, and. (a). Set up a 95% confidence interval estimate of the true average amount of soft drink in each bottle. Here, .a). Set up a 90% confidence interval estimate of the population proportion of students who have access to a PC outside the school. Here, . Again, this value is found by drawing a normal curve (by hand) in order to illustrate exactly what we need for this problem. Draw a curve and mark off the middle 90% of the area.
