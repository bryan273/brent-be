Yes you CAN use it for deer, as it it nearly 100% salt, but It does NOT supply any trace elements as a deer mineral block would. Whether the deer actually NEED the minerals, or even PREFER them, is a question of long-standing debate. They certainly don't need extra salt, either, but they sure like the taste.
