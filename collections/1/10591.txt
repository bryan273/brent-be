I have two albino corys, one Julli cory and two emerald corys. They are in a 55 gallon with one pangasius cat, a pearl flowerhorn, a pleco, a banjo cat, and a spotted green puffer. Everyone gets along very well. The corys love to school together and you can tell the albinos are a pair - they are always together.
