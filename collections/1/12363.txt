A toenail may be discolored due to blood getting trapped under the nail after an injury. Discolored toenails may be due to a fungal infection, or a symptom of a medical issue such as diabetes. Discolored toenails may occur as a result of a stubbed toe. Bacterial infection can discolor toenails. Discolored toenails that are also painful or difficult to maintain may need to be checked out by a podiatrist.
