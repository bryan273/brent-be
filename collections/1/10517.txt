Optimal health is generally dependent upon tissue homeostasis, which may be regulated by genetics as well as molecular processes in cells. The process is regulated by genes and possibly stem cells, which some researchers believe can differentiate into organ tissues that need to be repaired. Tissue homeostasis typically involves consistency in the content of blood, in coordination of organ activity, and in normal cell function. Body functions are usually affected by activities that occur at the molecular level.
