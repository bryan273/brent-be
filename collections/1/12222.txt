Natural development – teeth usually have spaces between them when they first come through. The arrival of the canine teeth often closes any gaps. Missing teeth – some children are born missing one or two teeth (either baby or adult) in their jawbones, which leaves a space. Extra teeth – sometimes there are extra teeth in the bone which can prevent other teeth coming through, leaving a gap.
