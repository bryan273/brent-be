Many of our remaining giant rats are vulnerable to the threat of habitat degradation . Researchers identified seven species of extinct giant rat, the smallest weighing an estimated 3.3 lb (1.5kg) and the largest 11 lbs (5kg); as much as a miniature dachshund. The bones were discovered by archaeologists researching human activity on the islands. The early inhabitants obviously had a taste for rat, as the bones are charred and chewed.
