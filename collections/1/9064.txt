The wild oyster does exist but the reality is, almost all oysters are farmed. And that’s ok—better, actually. Oysters are filter feeders, pumping water through their bodies as they nibble on plankton and other bits of the sea. They need only seawater and the water needs them, so farming them makes sense. And besides, said Jacobsen, wild oysters don’t taste as good as farmed.
