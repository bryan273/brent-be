Landmark Resort 1501 S. Ocean Blvd., Myrtle Beach, SC 29577. The 300-foot lazy rivers (one indoor and one outdoor) at Landmark Resort are a huge hit with their annual visitors. Little ones love the lazy river and kiddie pools built just for them. Take a break from the water action and hit up the tropical 9-hole putt putt course on-site.
