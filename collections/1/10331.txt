Make sure the ribs are generously coated with a good BBQ rub. Here is a recipe for my rub which is great on ribs! 3 hours of smoking is the recommended time for pork spare ribs. If you are smoking back ribs you may want to smoke them for just 2 hours. Any more and you may find it dries the ribs out a bit too much. I have used hickory, apple, cherry, alder and maple woods with this method of smoking ribs.
