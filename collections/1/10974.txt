What is Quad Screening? Quad Screening is a prenatal test to determine the likelihood that a fetus (unborn baby) is affected with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18, and certain types of birth defects (open neural tube defect or abdominal wall defects). Chromosome abnormalities (e.g. trisomy 21, trisomy 18) occur more frequently as a woman ages.
