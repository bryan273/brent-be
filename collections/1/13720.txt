Becoming a professional poker player is actually very difficult but maybe not as hard as becoming a pro athlete. I notice the players are becoming well read. A lot of really sound poker advise has leaked out and the amateurs are reading and soaking it all up.So you have to keep learning new things.nyway, I do not recommend poker as a career for anyone who has not played poker nearly long enough to be able to understand themself what it takes to be a pro poker player as required to meet requirements of a career.
