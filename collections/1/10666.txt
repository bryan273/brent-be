Members may redeem up to 350 points per month. Points will expire on a rolling 12-month basis, meaning you may use them for 12 months from the date you earned them. If you drop out of the Essential Rewards program, you forfeit all points. Generally, one point is equivalent to $1. Redeem points by calling Customer Care at 1.800.371.3515.
