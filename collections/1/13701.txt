Compaction is the process in which  sediment is squeezed and in which the size of the pore space  between sediment grains is reduced by the weight and pressure of  ovâ€¦erlying layers.   Cementation is the process in which  sediments are glued together by minerals that are deposited by the  bodies of water.
