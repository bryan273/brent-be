I suspect that both varieties of sloths eat bugs. Since their fur is host for many types of parasites, the sloth scratches (a lot) and the sloth eats the bugs off of their claws. I deduced that this is how the sloth gets protein in their diet. suggested we learn about sloths and meet a few up close and personal. I m not real sure if the actual sloth and the plushy sloth got in a race who would be the winner. I think I d wager on the plushy. Now, put aside for now everything I have taught you about exotic pets it probably doesn t apply to the sloth.
