No, but there are some considerations. Your monthly benefits are effective beginning on your retirement date, regardless of whether you take a PLS advance. But by taking an advance in a lump sum, your monthly benefit is reduced for your lifetime to offset the advance of PLS. And, while monthly benefits begin on your retirement date, PLS advances take up to 90 days after your retirement date to finalize before payment is made.
