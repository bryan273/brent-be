Grand Theft Auto IV. Algonquin. Algonquin is Liberty City's equivalent to Manhattan, perhaps the most densely-populated island in the entire world. Rockstar has done a magnificent job of recreating such an environment and atmosphere in GTAIV, with endless amounts of people and cars crawling all over the island.
