What is a droopy eyelid or ptosis? A drooping eyelid or ptosis can be present at birth (congenital) or can occur later in life (acquired). Poor development of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle in the upper eyelid can lead to an inability to properly open the eye. It is the most common cause of congenital ptosis.
