As soda fountains gradually went out of fashion, the ice cream soda (containing soda water, syrup and ice cream) was popularly replaced by the ice cream float (ice cream in a soft drink). Perhaps the most beloved of the ice cream float recipes is the Root Beer Float, made with root beer and vanilla ice cream. A variation made with chocolate ice cream or cola in place of root beer, occasionally blended to milkshake consistency, is sometimes regionally referred to as a Black Cow or a Brown Cow.
