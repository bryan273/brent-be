The DNA double helix is held together by two types of bonds, covalent and. hydrogen. Covalent bonds occur within each linear strand and strongly bond the. bases, sugars, and phosphate groups (both within each component and between. components). Hydrogen bonds occur between the two strands and involve a base. from one strand with a base from the second in complementary pairing.
