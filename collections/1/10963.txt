Each of the 33 individual theaters at Cinemark’s Movies 16 and Tinseltown in Lubbock has been upgraded for digital presentations. The XD stands for Extreme Digital cinema. The XD is unlike any other local theater. The XD’s silver screen extends from ceiling-to-floor and wall-to-wall. James Meredith, vice president of marketing and communications at Cinemark’s home office in Dallas, said a Doremi server and a Barco DLP digital projector deliver the XD’s digital images.
