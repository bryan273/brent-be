The gap between the front teeth is called a diastema. The scientific name is diastema. If it is big, it can only cause aesthetic problems, and it can get fixed by many ways in dentistry (Orthodontics, bondings, veneers). But if it is small, some people just like having it, and it is ok. Shalise Graves.
