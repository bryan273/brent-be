When an atom has a different number of neutrons, because neutrons have no electric charge, the atom's electric charge is not affected. Isotopes do have a different atomic weight, though.On the periodic table, the atomic weight, or atomic mass, is given for each element. The number is not a whole number, since it reflects the natural abundance of isotopes of an element. For example, hydrogen's atomic mass is 4.003.
