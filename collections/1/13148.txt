Standard apple trees can grow to be 30 feet or taller in height, and take much longer to mature than the smaller varieties of dwarf and semi-dwarf. This long wait time, combined with the height of the tree, make standard apple trees impractical for the purposes of fruit production.warf apple trees only grow to be between 5 and 7 feet tall, and can take between 2 and 4 years to produce viable fruit. Semi-dwarf trees take between 3 and 6 years to reach maturity and produce viable fruit. These trees can reach over 20 feet tall.
