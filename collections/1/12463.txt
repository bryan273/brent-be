Horse saddle from normal saddle. A horse saddle is required to ride a horse, after taming it. To make a horse saddle you need five pieces of leather, arranged like a hat, and then three iron ingots positioned into a triangle underneath the leather. If you find a saddle from a dungeon, all you need to do is add an iron ingot underneath it and you will be able to turn it into a horse saddle.
