Follow @PatEsswein. If your windows on the world no longer enhance the facade of your house, shield it from the elements or filter out noise, it may be time to replace them with new ones that will complement your home's architecture, reduce your energy bills, increase your comfort, and promote peace and quiet.e generally charges $40 to $200 per window to install them.
