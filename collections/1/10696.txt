The story of pizza in America starts in New York City, on Spring Street in lower Manhattan, in 1905 when Gennaro Lombardi, a baker and pizzaiolo from Naples is granted the first license in the United States to sell pizza.he first generation trained by Lombardi to make New York pizza included Antonio (Totonno) Pero, who went on to open Totonno's (the first pizzeria in Brooklyn) in 1924, John Sasso, founder of John's of Bleecker Street, and, perhaps, Patsy Lancieri of Patsy's of East Harlem.
