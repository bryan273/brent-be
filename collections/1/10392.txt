For example, if you are comparing the mean age of people in two different cities, each sample can have numerous values; the person sampled could be anywhere from 1 to 110 years old. Below is a description of how to calculate a Confidence Interval for a population's mean. 95% Confidence Interval of a Mean is the interval that has a 95% chance of containing the true population mean. The width of a Confidence Interval is affected by the sample size. The larger the sample size, the more accurate and tighter is the estimate of the true population mean.
