Ground Beef Calculator. This page allows you to view nutrient information tailored to any fat or lean percentage within certain ranges, either for raw meat or meat cooked in a particular way. The user may find slight differences in the nutrient values generated by the ground beef calculator and those presented in SR for the same product. These differences are due to rounding,resulting from differences in the number of decimal places used by each system, and the complexity of the equations.
