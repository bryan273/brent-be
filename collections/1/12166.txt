Once again, we are about to succumb to Deliamania. Another book of hers came out this week ( How to Cook: Book Two), as seasonally tied to our palates as Dickens once was to our souls: it wouldn't be Christmas without Delia (even though she spends her Christmases in the West Indies). The book will hop to the top of the bestseller lists and just stay there.
