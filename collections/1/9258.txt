Finally, sometimes you see Effective Date used in a contract to refer to some date in the past. For instance, the parties to a distribution agreement signed on March 31, 2007, might want sales from January 1, 2007, to be included for purposes of determining 2007 sales. It would be simpler and clearer to say as much instead of using the term Effective Date and defining it to mean January 1, 2007.
