I know that the drop off sites all have names according to level. Region 1 is the Consortium Tradepost, Region 2 is the Alliance Supply Depot, Region 3 is the Refugee Relief Site, Region 4 is the Fighters Guild Locus, Region 5 is the Privateers Drop Off and Coldharbour is the Mages Guild Locus. So you want to go to the capital city of Region 3.
