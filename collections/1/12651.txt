Balanced signals are transmitted with both a positive and a negative phase and use three transmission wires: hot, cold, and ground. In this case, a dual (hot and cold) shielded ground cable is used. Unbalanced signals are transmitted with a positive phase only, and use two transmission wires: hot and ground. In this case, a cable containing one wire shielded by a mesh wire is used. Balanced cable: the two wires (hot and cold) that make up the cable core are covered with a shielding mesh wire Unbalanced cable: the single wire (hot only) that makes up the cable core is covered with a shielding mesh wire
