Our Quick change die holders allow for fast and easy die changing during forging. We can forge and fabricate custom dies of any kind, simply contact us. The 16 ton forging presses are built with the small shop in mind, simply roll the press out when in use and out of the way when you are done. No foundation of any kind needed. Running on any 110v 20 amp outlet allows you to take the press anywhere in the shop and even outside with an appropriately sized extension cord.
