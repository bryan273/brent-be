Prevent and remove arterial plaque naturally. (Health Secrets) The arteries are major blood vessels the heart uses to pump blood from it to the rest of the body. Over time, arterial walls can become congested with a fatty substance known as plaque.

Mainstream medicineâ€™s approach for treating plaque is to use drugs or surgery.
