You need to just take the pup out more often throughout the day and the night. I use to set the alarm and wake every 2 hours and then gradually make it every 3 hours then 4 you get the picture it took me 2 weeks and puppy was fully potty trained.f you don't want him to do that, just keep training him, If he does a good job, praise him. If he does a bad job, scold him. Yoiu shold get the game, Nintendogs for the DS, and Dogz 1, Dogz 2 for GBA. It gives you training. A lot! Its good for dog owners.
