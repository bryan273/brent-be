Making April â€“ I Wrote This Song lyrics. When I first started writing this I swear. My intentions were well. And I'd start with maybe a memory or two. But then I saw you for the first time in a while. And awkward thoughts brought awkward smiles. And I left your room for the very last time. And I know that I can't sleep.
