Overwintering spider lilies indoors will protect this frost-tender plant. If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, bring it back indoors when the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night. Repot in spring when you see new growth, and only when it gets too crowded, probably every 4 years or so. This tropical lily flowers best when potbound. Spider Lily Care Tips.
