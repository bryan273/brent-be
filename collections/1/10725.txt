Perhaps the most effective scent is deer urine. Spread this type of lure liberally across the section of your property where you want to attract deer. The animals are very likely to visit your land in order to investigate the new, strange deer that is in the territory. In addition, apply doe scent on the grass, leaves, or trees on your property to attract bucks.
