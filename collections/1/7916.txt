Lyme disease is spread by these ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the transmission of the bacterium through the skin to infect the body. So Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease. Lyme disease is not contagious from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system.
