A kitten is usually weaned around 5 to 8 weeks but it has been known that they will nurse for 6 months or longer, although this depends on the momma cat. Sometimes if there isâ€¦ only one kitten the mother may not cut the kittens off at all you may have to separate them so that the momma cat will dry up.
