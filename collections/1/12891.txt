If so, if the bubbles/foams continue, I suggest that you get a 24 hour urine collection done to detect protein volumn. Urinalysis dipsticks are not good at detecting all proteins. That means negative results doesnt rule out protein in urine completely. The 24 hour urine collection is far more reliable.
