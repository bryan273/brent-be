SoMo came from a musical family and at a young age he was playing clubs around Austin, Texas with his father who was in a band called Duck Soup. Although he took a break from music in high school, he later came back to music in 2008 when his mother gave him a piano. In 2009 he started to perform cover songs and in 2011 some of his cover songs from Drake’s “Take Care” album gained him a huge following when he posted the songs on YouTube.
