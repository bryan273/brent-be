Wireworm (Click Beetle) These inch long, hard segmented-shell yellow, gray or reddish-brown worms are the larvae of beetles, normally voracious feeders of vegetable crops, eating the interior tissue of seeds and roots. They resemble earthworms except for their hard segmented body, and feed entirely underground during their life cycle.
