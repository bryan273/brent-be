No two cases of lupus are exactly alike. Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent. Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes — called flares — when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: 1  Fatigue and fever. 2  Joint pain, stiffness and swelling. 3  Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose.
