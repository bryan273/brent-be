KBB Expert Rating: 7.3. Ford's latest Explorer is a far different vehicle than those of the generations before it. What used to be a rough and rugged truck-based vehicle is now a sleeker, softer and more fuel-efficient crossover SUV. Gone are features like a 2-speed transfer case and V8 engine that enabled the old Explorer to climb mountains.
