Soil profiles. Dig down deep into any soil, and you’ll see that it is made of layers, or horizons. Put the horizons together, and they form a soil profile. Like a biography, each profile tells a story about the life of a soil. Every soil originally formed from parent material: a deposit at the Earth’s surface.
