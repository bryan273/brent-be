The Zone diet typically caps daily calories for women at 1,200 and 1,500 for men. That’s two-thirds to three-quarters of the amount generally recommended for healthy people. You’ll eat five times a day: three meals and two snacks. Each meal should contain 40 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent healthy fat. After one year, the Zone dieters had lost an average of 7 pounds, compared with 7.3 for the Ornish group, 6.6 for Weight Watchers, and 4.6 for Atkins, and fewer Zone (and Weight Watchers) dieters had dropped out (about 35 percent) than Atkins and Ornish dieters (about 50 percent).
