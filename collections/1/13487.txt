All these drugs digest clots by increasing the amount of plasmin (plasmin dissolves clots) in the blood. To produce plasmin, the substance plasminogen must first be activated. Plasminogen is converted into plasmin by certain enzymes known as plasminogen activators. Streptokinase has been used since about 1960.
