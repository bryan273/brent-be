This type of mutation is a change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by a gene. nonsense mutation is also a change in one DNA base pair. Instead of substituting one amino acid for another, however, the altered DNA sequence prematurely signals the cell to stop building a protein. This type of mutation results in a shortened protein that may function improperly or not at all.
