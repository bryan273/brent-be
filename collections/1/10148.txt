It's a volume mousse. I put more in than a hairdresser would use to give it oomph. I have dead straight, fine hair but there's bloody loads of it and have to have it thinned regularly, or I'd look like I was wearing a hat. Got2be is cheap at the Savers - and as good as the Redken mouse I was a fan of.
