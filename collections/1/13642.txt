What is the melting point of tire rubber? Rubber in tyres is a mixture of many things; latex, chalk, carbon, rosin, sulphur or some other vulcanization, etc. Such a mixture is quite unlikely to have a single melting pâ€¦oint. A softening point may be a better term. This point is easily within the reach of super-heated steam, which is the main process heat.
