The ammunition storage area aboard a warship is referred to as a magazine or the ship's magazine by sailors. Historically, when artillery was fired with gunpowder, a warship's magazines were built below the water line â€” especially since the magazines could then be readily flooded in case of fire or other dangerous emergencies on board the ship.
