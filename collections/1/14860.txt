Contacted a local plumber, who troubleshot the the well pump, they said the pump had very low amps, and wanted to pull the well pump (200 feet). They pulled the old pump (13 years old), and advised me to replace the pump. 3/4 Grundfo pump installed, they used same wire which was in good shape replaced adapters on old plastic pipe, new control box.
