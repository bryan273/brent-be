When and how to eat if you have diarrhea: 1  Try a clear liquid diet — water, weak tea, apple juice, clear broth, frozen pops, or plain gelatin — as soon as diarrhea starts or you feel it's going to start. Clear liquids keep the bowels from working too hard and help prevent irritation.  Eat small, frequent meals.
