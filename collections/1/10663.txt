The earliest mime artist known to us by name was the Roman Livius Andronicus (284â€“204 BC). According to tradition, he turned to mime when his voice failed after a series of performances. In Imperial times the mimus, a type of bawdy knockabout farce, and the performances of the lascivious pantomimus became popular.
