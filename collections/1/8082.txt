When you are jerking game meats, freeze meats for at least 60 days at 0°F (-18°C) before drying as a precaution against any diseases the animal might be carrying. Then thaw meat, add seasoning and press into strips or sticks, and place on trays to dry. Depending on how thick meat is cut, how heavily dryer is loaded, and the humidity, jerky takes from 4 to 15 hours to dry.
