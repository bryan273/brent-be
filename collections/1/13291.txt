Some Armenian last names bear the suffix -նց ([nʦʰ]), transliterated as-nc, -nts or-ntz (as in Bakunts or Adontz), or in addition to-yan/-ian (as in Vardanyants), although that is not common. Some Armenian surnames have a suffix -լի ([li]) preceding the -յան/-եան suffix. For example, Sivaslian and Vanlian refer to the cities of Sivas and Van, respectively.
