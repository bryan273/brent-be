If they are cut flowers and you do not like the smell, throw them away. If they are in a pot to be planted later on, keep the pot outside with morning sun and afternoon shade. If you live where the sun gets into the 90' early in the day, only give them sun until 10:00 AM or there abouts. Joanne A. Â· 10 years ago.
