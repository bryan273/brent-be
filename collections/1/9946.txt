Spring, summer, autumn, fall, and winter are common nouns like any other. Think of them as similar to morning, afternoon, and night —terms that denote clearly defined periods of time but are not capitalized because they are not proper nouns. As parts of official names, however, seasons are capitalized—for example, the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Fall 2011 semester.
