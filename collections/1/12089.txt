Then wash on a high temp. Its not stains I want to get rid of, its when a client has laid on the towel and the oil has absorbed into it! I don't do massage any more but the lady who does massage on me (many years of experience) uses sunflower oil now because it doesn't stain and it washes out of towels very readily.
