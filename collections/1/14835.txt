There are other adhesives out there that are considered the “strongest” but only relative to the application. For example, there are chemical adhesives that actually chemically bond two surfaces becoming as strong as the substrate they are applied to. There is even a bacteria that can attach to solid surfaces which is the strongest glue known to exist in nature but only develops in the presence of water. So, in the end, being the strongest glue really depends on what you put the adhesive on, what the intended use is for, and how it is applied.
