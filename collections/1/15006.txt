Plant the spider lily bulbs with the tip of each bulb 4 inches beneath the soil surface. Space the bulbs 8 to 12 inches apart in all directions so they have room to spread. Water the soil immediately so it settles around the bulbs. Provide about 1 inch of water, or enough to moisten the top 6 inches of soil.
