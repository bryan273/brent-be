The NHL as we know it today was started right after World War 1 and at that time only featured 5 teams the Montreal Canadians, the Toronto Arenas, the Ottawa Senators, the Quebec Bulldogs, and the Montreal Wanderers. This is a far cry from what the NHL is today as it has two conferences and many divisions.
