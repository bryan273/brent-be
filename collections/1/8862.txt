Answer: Detective Mike Lowrey. Mike is the ladies man in the movie, but he has to pretend to be a married man. He must switch places with Marcus when they are around the only eyewitness to a crime involving the murder of one of Mike's lady friends. Marcus Burnett (played by Martin Lawrence) is Mike's partner, Captain Howard (played by Joe Pantoliano) is the boss, and Jojo (played by Michael Imperioli) is the guy Marcus and Mike question.
