What should it be? A normal fasting blood glucose target range for an individual without diabetes is 70-100 mg/dL (3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The American Diabetes Association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of 70â€“130 mg/dL (3.9-7.2 mmol/L) and after meals less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). Individuals with hypoglycemic unawareness (limited or no awareness of low blood glucose symptoms) may require a higher target range.
