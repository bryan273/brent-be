Urine test strip. A urine test strip or dipstick test is a basic diagnostic tool used to determine pathological changes in a patientâ€™s urine in standard urinalysis. A standard urine test strip may comprise up to 10 different chemical pads or reagents which react (change color) when immersed in, and then removed from, a urine sample. The test can often be read in as little as 60 to 120 seconds after dipping, although certain tests require longer.
