The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is commonly used by corporations and by marriage counselors. Corporations will type their employees and train in the hopes that everybody learns to get along with types that are different from themselves, to communicate better. elcome to my web site on the different Myers-Briggs personalities. I have collected information from several resources, books, lectures I have attended, and magazines (so, no, I did not write the majority of this). This website is strictly for my family, coworkers, and friends.
