If you are buying the car from a private party, keep your plates and go to any DMV branch location with proof of insurance, your bill of sale, the title (which must be signed over to you by the previous owner), and the car's previous registration. On your registration, you must go to one of the DMV locations with your new license, (the temporary license with your new name will suffice) your title, your legal document, and proof of insurance. 2  You will be asked to fill out the TR-1 form.
