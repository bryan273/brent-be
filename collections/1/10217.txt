The devil is in the details. Together the spinal cord and the brain form the central nervous system (CNS). It is connected to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which includes the nerves in our extremities. But, there are big differences between the two. Firstly the nervous cells (neurons) in CNS and PNS differ in ways such as their potential to regenerate. And, there are more cell types in the nervous system than just neurons. For a long time, those glial cells were regarded as mainly supporting cells (‘glia’ is ancient Greek name for glue).
