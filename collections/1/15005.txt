The enchanting blossoms of spider lilies seem to appear out of nowhere following late-summer rains. Try these classic bulbs at home to create your own miraculous show. Spider lilies move around with us in the South. True pass-along plants, these bulbs thrive in old gardens, yards, and cemeteries. Their show starts a few days after a good rain shower in September. From bare ground, stalks burst through and unfurl their Chinese red, curvy petals and stamens.
