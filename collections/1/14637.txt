Staying hydrated is one of the secrets to healthy looking skin, and is a great way to protect your organs. But drinking the recommended eight glasses of water a day can get old fast, so switch it up with prune juice. Prune juice is made from dried prunes, or plums, which contain many nutrients that can contribute to good health. Prunes are a good source of energy, and donâ€™t give rise to a rapid hike in blood sugar concentration. This is possibly due to their high fiber, fructose, and sorbitol content.
