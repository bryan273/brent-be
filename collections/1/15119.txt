But I want to share with you an experience I had 19 years ago which might help someone sometime. The uro who did my first cysto 19 years ago told me he wanted to do the cysto with a general anesthesia. When I questioned the need and wisdom of the general anesthesia he offered to have the anesthesiologist speak to me.
