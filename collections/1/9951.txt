- An excerpt from “The Sensitive Plant” by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The capitalization of seasons has specific rules in the English language. When the seasons are used generally, they should not be capitalized; however, when seasons are used in a title, then the first letter should be capitalized. Seasons, such as winter, spring, summer and fall, do not require capitalization because they are generic nouns.
