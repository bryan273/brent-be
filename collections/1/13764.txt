Eating pork products is one way to get potassium. A boneless pork loin chop contains about 770 milligrams of potassium, which meets 16 percent of your daily need for the mineral. A three-ounce serving of Canadian bacon gives you 598 milligrams of potassium and one cup of roasted, cured ham has 573 milligrams.While these pork products are high in potassium, they are also relatively high in fat and also contain cholesterol.ruits and vegetables are some of the best sources of the mineral, but certain meat and animal products help meet your needs, as well. The American Institute for Cancer Research suggests that you eat no more than 18 ounces of red meat, such as pork, beef and lamb per week to reduce risk of disease.
