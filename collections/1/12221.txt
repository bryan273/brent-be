What is the free ginigva? Located coronal to the CEJ, surrounds the tooth like a turtleneck, and fits snuggly around the tooth but is not attached. Can be gently pulled away from the tooth with a probe, and forms soft tissue wall of sulcus. It meets the tooth in a thin rounded edge called the gingival margin.
