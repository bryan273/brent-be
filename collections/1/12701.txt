There is question as to whether or not the Brush Goat is actually a stand alone breed. A Brush Goat is a goat or herd of goats that was given the name simply because they are used for the purpose of clearing brush. Spanish goats are often called by the name Brush Goat. In modern day terms, a Brush Goat can either be a mixed breed or goat of another breed but is most often the type of goat that has been culled from a herd for any given reason and used primarily to control brush. Therefore, Brush Goat is more or less a term rather than a breed, used to describe a function of a goat.
