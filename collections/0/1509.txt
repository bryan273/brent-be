The freezing point depends on the spirit's proof, or alcoholic concentration, which is is double its alcohol percentage. Vodka is usually about 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol. Wine is usually around 28 proof, and grain alcohol is 190 proof -- pretty darn close to pure alcohol [source: Real Simple ].
