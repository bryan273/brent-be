Each car and truck built after 1980 has been stamped by the manufacturer with a unique vehicle identification number or VIN. The VIN is unique to the vehicle the way your fingerprint is unique to you, and it's how we are able to deliver critical vehicle specific data in the AutoCheck Â® vehicle history report.
