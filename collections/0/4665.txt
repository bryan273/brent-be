Best Answer: If it is royal icing it is dependant on how thick you have made the icing. I haven't done mine yet I've been a bit lazy this year. Yours will be fine for Christmas day. It normally takes a couple of days to really set properly. Whatever you do don't put the cake in a fridge, just store it in a cool place.
