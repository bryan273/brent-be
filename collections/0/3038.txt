Maybe you've never thought about the difference between being an employee and being an independent contractor (also called a consultant). In many respects, there seems to be no difference at all. Often, independent contractors and employees work side by side at the same company, even doing the same or similar work. But there are very important legal differences between being a contractor and an employee. These differences go beyond job title.
