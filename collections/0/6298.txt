This is a work in progress but will contain all the measurements and equivalents I can think of that pertain to making ice cream. US Standards of Measurements. Ice Cream Quantities. 1 scoop of ice cream is roughly 1/2 cup. 1 serving of ice cream is the same, 1/2 cup. There are 2 cups in a pint or 4 scoops of ice cream. There are 4 cups/2 pints in a quart so 8 scoops of ice cream. There are 6 cups/3 pints or 12 scoops in 1.5 quarts of ice cream. There are 8 cups/ 4 pints or 16 scoops in 2 quarts of ice cream.
