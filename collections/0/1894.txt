She'll have a mission! I can't wait to get some new appliances, the stove is nearly 20 years old and looks very dated, I'm tasting a solid surface instead of burners! And I can't wait to have a back-up fridge in the garage, that's where our 15 year old white one will go, for when we entertain or when Woody hunts. Oh, bliss! Extra room.
