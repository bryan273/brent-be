Edible by. Humans. Mealbread was a type of bread which was served in the mess halls of the First Order's Starkiller Base. The four human stormtroopers of the FN Corps ate mealbread alongside slivers of meat and numian cream while training on Starkiller Base, a meal designed more for efficiency than flavor.
