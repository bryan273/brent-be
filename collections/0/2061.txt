If by noodle bars you mean ramen places (as in noodles in soup), then Wagamama is not authentic. Ramen places in Japan are usually fairly down at heel, street corner type places along the lines of a local caff in London serving fish and chips, jellied eels and shepherds pie. None of the trendy flashiness of Wagamama.
