Change the drawing page size. Click the page tab of the foreground or background page you want to resize. On the File menu, click Page Setup. Click the Page Size tab, and under Page size, click the drawing page size you want. The drawing page size is set for the page that is currently displayed. If the page has any background pages assigned, you must set the background page size separately. Tip Check the thumbnail preview to see how your drawing fits on the printer paper.
