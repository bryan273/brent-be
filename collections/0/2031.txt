The Jews in the time of Jesus did not use last names    He was known as Jesus (or Yeshua) son of (bar) Joseph. Perhaps his  name would be closer to Yeshua bar Youssef.â€¦ Names were not  organized and handed down as they are in current western culture.  Contrary to popular belief, Christ is not his 'last name'.
