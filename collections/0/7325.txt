An interior basement drainage system should also be implemented for maximum protection. These basement waterproofing systems add a layer of protection around the basement's floor and wall joints, which is where flooding tends to begin. Installation of a new interior drainage system can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000 depending on the size of the space.
