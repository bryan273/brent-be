There are a number of fire giants in the Brimhaven Dungeon, which requires a toll of 875gp per trip (exempt from toll if a player has ever acquired the Karamja Gloves 3) to access. These giants are now a good option for both training and slayer, as the wild dogs are unaggressive to players who are over combat level 71.
