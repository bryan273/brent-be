WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Urethral stent placement is a procedure to open a blockage or stricture (narrowing) in your urethra with a stent. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. A stent is a small plastic or metal tube that is used to open your narrowed urethra. Blockages and strictures can make it hard for urine to flow out of your body. Pelvic (hip) injuries and repeat urinary tract infections may lead to urethral strictures and blockages.
