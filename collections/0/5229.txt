There is also a new method of finding out the sex that is gaining in popularity, it's called the Ramzi's Method or Ramzi's Readings. This uses ultrasound in early pregnancy, as early as six weeks pregnant, to be able to tell the gender of your baby based on locating the placenta. Most physicians don't offer this per se, but you can certainly ask about it.
