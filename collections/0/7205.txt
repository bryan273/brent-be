Puscifer's original name was Umlaut, a premiere improvisational hardcore band. The name Puscifer was first publicized as a fictional band in the first episode of Mr. Show, including Keenan and Adam Jones as members. Jones is not associated with Puscifer otherwise, although artwork by Jones has been featured on Puscifer apparel (the Your Mom's a Bitch shirt, specifically).
