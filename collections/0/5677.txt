The Riverfront area of Greenwich is one of the most interesting areas to explore. Here you can find the Cutty Sark, a historic clipper ship built in 1869, now the only remaining nineteenth-century tea clipper. In 1871 the clipper broke the world sailing record by traveling from China to London in just 107 days.
