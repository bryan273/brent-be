The paint can gives you an estimate of square footage or something or other. That was useless to me. When I'm thinking of what I'm painting, for example, two lamps or a picture frame, then a square footage doesn't help me out. Actually, there's some brands that don't even give you an estimate. Anyways, so I thought I'd give you an example of what one spray paint can might do for you.
