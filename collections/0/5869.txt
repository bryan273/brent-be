Babies' eyes change color about six to nine months after birth. This is usually when melanin production starts inside the eyeball. A one year old with darkly pigmented eyes might have been born with blue eyes. Eye color change in babies is usually from a lighter to darker shade. Don't expect your baby's brown eyes to change back to a blue â€“ it most likely will not happen naturally. The amount of melanin in the eye is determined by genetics.
