Centred on Geelong, Victoria's second-largest city, this seat also includes surrounding suburbs and towns such as Norlane, Lara, Drysdale and Portarlington. It has been held by Labor since 1967, and since 2007 by Richard Marles. Corio includes a Ford manufacturing plant that will close in October 2016 with the loss of more than 500 jobs. Geelong is the location of the national headquarters of DisabilityCare Australia and one of four sites nationally where the scheme launched in July. Bob Hawke, who would go on to be Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, ran unsuccessfully for the seat of Corio in 1963.
