The median nerve may divide into two nerve bundles in the distal forearm and appear as a bifid median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It has an incidence of ~3%. The median nerve usually divides into two or three branches after exiting the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament that covers the carpal tunnel. These subdivide into digital nerves that supply opposing sides of the digits.
