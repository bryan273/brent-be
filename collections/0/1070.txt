A transformer’s leakage impedance is a series element that reﬂects imperfections in. the windings. The real component of the leakage impedance is the resistance of the. windings. Its reactive component is due to leakage ﬂux,i.e. ﬂux in the magnetic circuit. that does not contribute to coupling the windings. Figure1depicts a transformer’s equivalent circuit with impedances referred to the sec-. ondary.
