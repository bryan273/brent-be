CSV (Comma Separated Value) was a file format devised to store tabular data. It uses commas to separate each entry in a row and the newline symbol to go to the next row. Excel is a more recent spreadsheet application from Microsoft and it saves the data with its own file format. Excel is way more superior compared to CSV as it is able to do a lot more to the tabular data. Formatting is one of the biggest feature that comes with newer spreadsheet applications.
