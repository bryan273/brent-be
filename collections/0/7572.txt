In some cultures the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the left hand, while in others it is on the right hand. Traditionally, a wedding ring was worn by the bride/wife on the ring finger, but in recent times more men also wear a wedding ring on the ring finger. It is also the custom in some cultures not to wear a ring on the ring finger unless one is married, though an engagement ring is usually also worn on the ring finger.
