• The stent may irritate your bladder causing you to feel a need to pass urine frequently. • You may see blood in your urine on some occasions. Sometimes you may feel pain in your back (on the side of your body where the stent is) when passing urine. This is usual as the stent may rub against the wall of your ureter.
