Bill's income is $850 from Social Security. Jane earns $400 per month from part time work. Bill is not eligible for QMB (or SLMB) because the state treats him as if he was single even though the state counts Jane's income. The fact that Jane's income is counted is what makes him ineligible. The QMB income limit for a single person is $981 per month and the SLMB income limit for a single person is $1,177. Bill is eligible for QI-1 because the QI-1 income limit for a single person is $1,325.
