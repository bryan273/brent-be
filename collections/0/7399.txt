A logical fallacy is often what has happened when someone is wrong about something. It's a ï¬‚aw in reasoning. Strong arguments are void of logical fallacies, whilst arguments that are weak tend to use logical fallacies to appear stronger than they are. They're like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often. very sneakily used by politicians, the media, and others to fool people.
