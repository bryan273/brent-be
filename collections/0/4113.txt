Edinburgh-Currency. The UK currency is the pound sterling (Â£), with 100 pence (p) to a pound. 'Quid' is a slang term for pound. Several Scottish banks issue their own bank notes which can be used in the north of England and in Northern Ireland, but may be refused elsewhere. UK banks will accept them but foreign banks generally do not.
