WILKES-BARRE -- The Wilkes-Barre zoning board struck down an application to build a new consolidated school in Wilkes-Barre. The zoning board voted 2-to-1 to reject the application for a new high school to be built on North Washington Street. The Wilkes-Barre Area School District had planned to build its new high school on the site of Coughlin High School, right in the heart of the downtown. Wednesday night's decision leaves Wilkes-Barre Area School District officials potentially looking at alternative sites outside the city.
