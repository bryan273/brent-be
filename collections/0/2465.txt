Red Panda Population in the Wild The current red panda population is difficult to estimate and ranges anywhere from 2,500 to 20,000. As mentioned, these red pandas are spread across several countries. China, for example, is home to just over 42% of all red panda habitats and as of 1999, has a red panda population of between 3,000 and 7,000. In India, the population is believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000.
