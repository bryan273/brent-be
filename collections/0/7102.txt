A company like Treyarch has over 300 employees and it takes them 2 years to design a new game. That is not something a single individual can do. They were purchased by Activision before the first game was released.ven if you do so you have to sell the game so it can be marketed. on the other hand you can work for a company and some people get paid around $50/hr. and some get paid like 100 grand after the game is done again it depends on where you work and how you work on it.
