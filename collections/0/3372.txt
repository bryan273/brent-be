The helix dipole may contribute to the binding of charged species to the protein: for example, negative nucleotide phosphates, which are typically found near the N-termini of helices. FIG. 17. A short segment of 310 helix from carbonic anhydrase (residues 159-164). Main chain carbonyl oxygens are shown as open circles.
