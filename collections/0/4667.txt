The oven worked. I was able to use them about 4 hours late and they stayed together pretty well. it was a transfer of a stork so I was a bit worried about the legs but whew - it worked! Dry time depends on a few things: (1) thickness of icing to start; (2) size of the transfer; and (3) ambient conditions . . . I've had teeny tiny flowers (1/4 inch) dry in less than 1/2 hour with no assistance from a dehydrator. But they can take longer depending on conditions noted.
