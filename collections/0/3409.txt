A point mutation is a change in a single base pair in DNA. A change in a single nitrogenous base can change the entire structure of a protein because a change in a single aminâ€¦o acid can affect the shape of the protein. A frameshift mutation is a mutation in which a single base is added or deleted from DNA.
