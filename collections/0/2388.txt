This may also lead to localized muscle spasm and pain referred to other areas away from the injection site. Sometimes the original pain may return or occasionally get worse after a treatment. Notify the office only if your pain medication, anti-inflammatories, ice and/or heat are ineffective. MEDICATION POLICY: If appropriate, controlled medications (narcotics, relaxants, and sedatives) may be prescribed prior to discharge from your procedure. Prescribing controlled medications over the phone is avoided.
