Charles Ray Smith, 44, stared straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdict was read in a downtown courtroom. Smith was convicted during a previous trial of taking part in two deadly shootings in 2006, including one that became known as the 49th Street Massacre in which two men wielding AK-47s opened fire on children and adults enjoying a Friday summer afternoon.
