You have to have Health Insurance in 2014 and forward. If you do not have health insurance (specifically Qualified Health Plan – QHP) you will pay a penalty (tax). The penalty for 2014 is the greater of $95 or 1% of house hold income reported on last year’s tax statement (the penalty will increase in 2015, and 2016).
