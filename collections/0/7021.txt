A twin mattress, also referred to as a single mattress, accommodates one adult or child sleeper. A twin model is 39 inches by 75 inches and typically works best in a smaller bedroom, on a daybed or with a bunk bed set. While it's possible to have two sleepers on a twin size mattress, it might be too snug. A twin size mattress fits in small bedrooms where space might be limited.
