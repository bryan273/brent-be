Any reverse-painted glass lamp designed by the American designer Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933) would be marked. From the last quarter of the 19th century through the first third of the 20th century, there were a number of manufacturers producing table lamps in a similar style, which will make it difficult to note the designer.
