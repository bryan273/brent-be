Cells found in bone tissue: osteoprogenitor cells - these are like stem cells for bone. They have the capacity to divide and proliferate to form osteoblasts, bone forming cells which actively produce bone tissue. They comprise the periosteal and endosteal cells (see below) which line the bone and its cavities.
