Just another night on the town. With the big man, money man, better then the other man. He got the plan, with the million dollar give a damn. What nobody understands. Become a smaller man, the bright lights keep flashin, Women keep on dancing with the clowns, Yeah, yeah, yeah, They pick me up when I'm down, Yeah, yeah, The rodeo clowns. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they pick me up when I'm down. The disco ball's spinnin', all the music and the women.
