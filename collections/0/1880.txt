Please.... Please..... (Come on). Well I'm tryin' to make some sense of it all, But I can see it makes no sense at all, Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor, 'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore. There's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, Here I am, stuck in the middle with you.
