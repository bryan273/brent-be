When you go somewhere, whether it's for fun or business, it's always nice to have an escort — someone to go along with you. Some escorts are there to protect you, some just to share a good time. The word escort can be a noun or a verb — your escort escorts you.. This word is derived from the Latin excorrigere, to set out, and moved through the Italian scorgere, meaning to guide.. In the 1570s it took on a military tone as escorte, used to describe armed protectors for travelers.
