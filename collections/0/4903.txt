You will be routed to the closest Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) for a temporary pass. VPCs are located at Fort Shafter’s Buckner Gate, Tripler Army Medical Center’s main gate, Pohakuloa’s main gate and Schofield Barracks’ Lyman Gate (for access to either Schofield Barracks or Wheeler Army Airfield). The VPC provides daily passes that expire at midnight on the date of issue, based on need.
