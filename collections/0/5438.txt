Your degree title will reflect the choices you make in the latter years of your programme. So, for example, your degree certificate might say “Liberal Arts (English)” or “Liberal Arts (History)”. The same applies to the MLibArts, which would give you a degree titled “MLibArts (English)” or “MLibArts (History)”.
