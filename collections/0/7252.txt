What the Hell Happened to...Sherman Douglas? Long before Rajon Rondo attempted any of his floaters it was this guy, the General, that was known as the master of the push-shot. If you watched Big East basketball in the late 80s, you would've remembered him running the point guard for the Orangemen of Syracuse. If you followed the Celtics back in the 90s, you absolutely remember Sherman Douglas. After attending Spingarn High School in Washington DC, he would go on to Syracuse where he teamed up with Rony Seikaly, Stephen Thompson, Billy Owens and Derrick Coleman under coach Jim Boeheim for some very talented college teams.
