The version of this song which made it famous was released by Judy Collins in 1975, although (I think) it had previously been covered on albums by Frank Sinatra and Sara â€¦ h Vaughn. The song was written by Stephen Sondheim for his 1973 musical A Little Night Music in which it was sung by actress Glynis John.
