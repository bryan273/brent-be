Because the 6 days would not raise the garnishment and the 4 days of work lower the garnishment because the garnishment was too high a percentage of 4 days of work. Depends on pay periods/dates, and how the garnishment order is written. Different scenarios, ignoring mandatory taxes, assuming an hourly wage of $10, a weekly pay date, and a set garnishment of $150 a week, not to exceed 40% of net pay: $10 x 40 hours = $400 pay - $150 garnishment=$250 net to employee.
