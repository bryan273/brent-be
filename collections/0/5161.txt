1 Mosaic Trisomy 21 â€“ This is a rare form (less than 2% of cases) of Down syndrome. 2  While similar to simple trisomy 21, the difference is that the extra chromosome 21 is present in some, but not all cells, of the individual. 3  This type of Down syndrome is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.
