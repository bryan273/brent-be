Focusâ€™ model-year 2015 update brought a restyled hood, grille, and trunk lid, along with LED head and taillights. The interior received revised materials, new seat trims, switchgear, and a larger center console. For 2017, Ford will continue to build the Focus as you see it now until the parts run out at the factory.
