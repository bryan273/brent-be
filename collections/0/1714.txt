What is an Ear Infection? Infection can affect the ear canal (otitis externa), the eardrum , or the middle ear (otitis media). Most ear injuries are caused by pressure changes during direct injury (such as a blow to the ear) or sport scuba diving, but, a persistently painful ear may signal an infection that requires treatment.
