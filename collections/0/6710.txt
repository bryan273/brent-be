Pex Plumbing System with a Boiler Hello, My family just bought and moved into a new home. My parents had a hydronic heating system in their house. The heat was always comfortable there so I was excited to see it when we looked at this house. I need to do some plumbing work on the water supply. I have read about using oxygen impermeable PEX on the lines between the boiler and the radiator.
