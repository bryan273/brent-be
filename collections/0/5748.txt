Dedication of the New Lyke House With the support of a number of generous volunteers from the local community, Fr. Branch worked diligently to position the Lyke House Catholic Center for service in the year 2000 and beyond. In particular, the dedication and volunteer time of the members of the Building Design Committee opened new doors of opportunity for the Catholic center.
