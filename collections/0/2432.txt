Separate plasma by centrifugation. Transfer the serum, plasma or whole blood to a plastic transport tube (see Pediatric Specimen Tubes below). To prevent injury and exposure to potentially infectious material, do not ship frozen serum, plasma, or whole blood received in glass tubes or SST (glass or plastic).
