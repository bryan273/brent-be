If the ESP light on a Mercedes Benz stays on, try holding the ESP button down for a few seconds. If holding ESP down for a few seconds doesn't reset the program, it's time to head to your local Mercedes dealership for a repair. More likely than not, there is some sort of error with the steering mechanism which causes the ESP light to remain on.
