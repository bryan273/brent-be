Air is drawn into the unit to capture particles. The airborne particles pass through an electrostatic field and receive an ionized charge. The charged particles move into a collector section where each alternate plate is charged with the same polarity as the particles. This drives the particles to the second set of plates of an opposite charge to attract and collect the particles. The cleaned air is then returned to the plant or building.
