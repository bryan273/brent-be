Vegito is able to transform into a Super Saiyan, calling himself  Super Vegito  (or Super Vegerot in the English manga) in this form. As a Super Saiyan, he gains a slight increase in muscle mass, bluish-green eyes, very defined golden hair and eyebrows and a golden aura (with occasional surges of blue electricity).
