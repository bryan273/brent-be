When Can I Find the Sex of My Baby? Most expectant mothers are able to find out the sex of their baby during their ultrasound. This is normally at mid pregnancy between the 16th and 20th weeks. Of course the choice is usually the motherâ€™s and the ultrasound technician can only tell if they have a clear view of the genitals.
