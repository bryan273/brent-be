But when I go to the VMWare site, there are dozens of products to choose from, including the following four which seem to relate to what I want: View, ThinApp, Ace and Workstation. I'm inclined to just purchase VMWare Workstation because I've used it in the past. But they're offering a free 60-day trial of View.
