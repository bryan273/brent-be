If you decide that word ‘smells’ bad, you may end up feeling bad. In doing so, you give the word, and therefore the person, your consent to make you feel inferior. You could just as easily decide the word smells nice, or at least neutral, denying the word, and therefore the person, your consent. It really is that easy.
