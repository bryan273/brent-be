We think Duncraft’s Cardinal House will do just that! With a little luck, our finicky Cardinals may come to learn that the nesting shelves we provide for them are sturdy, dry and provide a secure platform for their nests. In time, the birds may become less wary of them. Safer nests will help to ensure the future of this beautiful bird! –R.
