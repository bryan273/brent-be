Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive #5 (February 2003), the Federal government has created the National Incident Management System (NIMS). This system directs the creation of a comprehensive, national approach to incident management by federal, state, territorial, Tribal and local responders. The Presidential Directive also makes NIMS compliance a requirement for any of these entities wishing to receive Federal funds starting with Federal fiscal year 2007.
