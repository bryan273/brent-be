The 4th 'C' of diamonds, clarity, is a measure of the amount, size, color and position of blemishes and 'inclusions' in the stone. Inclusions are small bits of other minerals or metals that are formed along with the diamond. Most diamonds have at least a few imperfections, even if only visible in extreme magnification.
