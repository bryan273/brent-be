Rumpelstiltskin is a fairy tale character, not a real person. In the tale Rumpelstiltskin, a miller boasted to a king that his daughter could spin straw into gold. As a result, the king locked the girl up with straw and a spinning wheel, and told her that she must spin the straw into gold or die the next day.
