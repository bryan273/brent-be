Graphic artists/designers report to the supervisor or director of their department, so a marketing director would be an example of their boss. Their work environment is frequently inside of in an office or boardroom. Working hours are generally regular business hours, Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Requirements for becoming a graphic artist/designer are a bachelor's degree in graphic art or design and a portfolio of works produced. Many jobs also require previous job experience in the field. Graphic artists/designers are fortunate in that they may work with the ideas they dream about, while others may think of these ideas as just fantasies.
