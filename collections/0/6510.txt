What Is the Difference Between a Misdemeanor and a Felony? The main difference between misdemeanors and felonies is the type of penalty that is associated with each. Misdemeanors only result in jail sentences for a maximum of one year. The sentence for a misdemeanor will usually be served in a local or county jail. On the other hand, a felony charge may result in imprisonment for greater than one year. The sentence will be served in a prison facility rather than a county jail.
