I do not like that you said Jesus is not an American. Obviously He was born in Bethlehem and is not from North America. The rhetorical implication here, is that Americans are not true Christians. There is a VERY judgemental and anti-American bias in the writings of this red letter group.As a fellow follower of Jesus and as an American I would like to remind you of some thing that is easy to forget.any Christians believe in retribution. They want a God who tells them that there should be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and they become furious when anyone suggests another kind of God who asks them to be merciful and forgiving. The God of grace is not to their liking.
