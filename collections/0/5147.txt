Please note the following in the Common Beverages Substitutions Chart: 1. Only the pH is provided. Calorie, sugar content and other information is not provided.. 2. Beer and wine are represented, but there are differences among the various brews and wines. In general, red wine is less acidic than white wine. 3. Spirits and liquors are not listed. Almost invariably, they are acidic. Acidity will vary, meaning the pH will vary among the different spirits and liquors and will also vary depending on the flavoring (as one sees, for example, in vodkas).
