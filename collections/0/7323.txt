Trench Drain length. Hey all, not in all my searching could I find the answer to this. The space we are looking at for our 7bbl brewhouse (3 vessel HLT, MT, and kettle) will need floor drains installed. After reading how much better trench drains are, I've gotten a quote for 100.00/linear foot installed.
