The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Dauisse, which was dated 1327, in the Subsidy Rolls of Cambridgeshire, during the reign of King Edward 111, known as The Father of the Navy, 1327 - 1377. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation.
