-Nope! I did not play Pokemon Amie at all to get my Espeon and Umbreon. Their happiness level and Pokemon Amie is completely different. You can still play Pokemon Amie and get your Espeon/Umbreon but make sure that your Eevee does not know a Fairy Move since it will evolve into a Sylveon if it does.
