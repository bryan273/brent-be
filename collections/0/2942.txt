1 CHILD CARE: If you send your child to daycare or hire a babysitter in order to go to work or school, you can claim child care expenses. 2  The deduction limit is $7,000 for each child under the age of seven and $4,000 for children seven to 16 years of age. So if your monthly pass costs $100, you can claim $1,200, which would result in a tax credit of $180 ($100 x 12 months x 15 percent). 2  You can claim these costs for any dependent children under 19. 3  Be sure to keep your passes so you can substantiate the amount you spent.
