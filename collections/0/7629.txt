When planning a camping trip by boat or 4-wheel drive road in Glen Canyon, it is best to buy a map beforehand. These show the side canyons, good hiking spots, points of interest and marinas, explain the navigation system, and may give fishing information. In an emergency you will need to report your location on Marine Band 16 or call 911. There is no camping fee or permit required to camp on the lake in undeveloped areas.
