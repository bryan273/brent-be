Between Lone Rock and Page is a little lookout spot called Wahweap Scenic Overlook. From here you can get a great view of Lake Powell, the Escalante Grand Staircase and Monument Valley. The photos really donâ€™t do it justice. Ava is really enjoying taking photos with both the phone and sometimes the DSLR camera.
