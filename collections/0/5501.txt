You might learn that the IRS has accepted your income tax return within days of filing or after a few weeks, depending on how you file. The Internal Revenue Service can accept your tax return within 72 hours of e-filing or within three weeks for a paper return. You will receive an email notification that your return has been received within 24 hours of your electronic submission. The Where's My Refund tool on the IRS website allows you to check the status of your tax refund, including the date that it was accepted.
