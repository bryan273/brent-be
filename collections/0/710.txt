The ThermaCELL appliance uses a butane cartridge to heat up a small mat that’s soaked in mosquito repellent. Don’t worry – there are no open flames so it’s safe to use around fabric and children. As the mat warms, the repellent is released into the air. Each appliance comes with one butane cartridge and three mats.
