From the problem you know two things. The two numbers have a quotient of 9 and a difference of 56.   Step 1: Write these facts as equations.  x/y = 9   x-y = 56  …  Step 2: Take one equation and solve for one of the variables.ou meant to say What is the quotient for 210 divided by 9. 210 divided by 9 will not be a whole number. The trick for seeing if it is, is doing 2+1+0=3. 3 is not a multiple … of 9.
