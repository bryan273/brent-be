This 18-mile stretch of Highway 1 runs between San Jos√© del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, and is home to many luxurious homes and hotels. Most of the Corridor hotels are luxury resorts, so if you planning on staying there, expect elevated rates. Getting around will also require the additional cost of a car or taxi.
