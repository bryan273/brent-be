I'm 84 years old and the answers always confuse me even more. So, thanks for your efforts, but I'm as stumped as I was when I first asked. I'll try to find someone in this area who has used one of the things and somehow persuade him/her to give me what instruction I need. Expert: Josh replied 3 years ago.
