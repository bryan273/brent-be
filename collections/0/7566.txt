The ring was then left on the ring finger. In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. A Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In Norway, Russia, Poland, Germany, Austria and in Spain (except in Catalonia) the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger on the right hand.
