It is very possible and quite normal to have some 'bleeding' early in pregnancy. I had a very good friend who was 6 1/2 months pregnant before she found out because she was having normal 'periods' (she was heavy set which was why she didn't notice any weight gain or other symptoms).est Answer: You can have bleeding, but not an actual period. Women mistakanly call the bleeding a period when it's not. A period is the disposal of the unused egg and uterus lining.
