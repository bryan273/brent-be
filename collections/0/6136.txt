Heading down there in August too. I'm no expert, but having vacationed in the OBX the last 5 years, I know August is the early portion of hurricane season. Most season's typically peak in September, but August has its fair share (Katrina). Jamaica is just as vulnerable as any other island in that neighborhood.
