What is it? A thin, hollow tube placed inside the ureter during surgery to ensure drainage of urine from the kidney into the bladder. J shaped curls are present at both ends to hold the tube in place and prevent migration, hence the description double J stent. It allows the kidney to drain urine by temporarily relieving any obstruction, or to assist the kidney in passing out stone fragments into the bladder after definitive kidney stone treatment.
