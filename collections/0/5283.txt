Because we live in an era where one must first “qualify” before one may opine, I guess I should say, “as a victim of repeated, sometimes violent sexual abuse”, I find this trend toward calling everything “unsafe” and immobilizing to be really, a bit much. As an actual strong woman, I call it insulting.
