Brachial Plexus: What Is It? The brachial plexus is made up of five nerves, which are fibers that carry electrical messages from the brain to the muscles. The brachial plexus nerves start in the spinal cord and branch out from the neck to the muscles and tissues down the arms. These nerves provide movement and feeling to the shoulders, arms, and hands.
