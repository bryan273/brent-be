Clydesdale horses were first exhibited under the breed name in 1826, and the breed was further standardized through the system of hiring out purebred stallions. The Clydesdale Horse Society was formed in 1877, and its breed registry records go back to the 1830s. The Clydesdale was first imported to North America in the 1840s. The breedâ€™s attractiveness and size led to its use in promotional hitches, such as one sponsored by the Chicago Stockyard Company.
