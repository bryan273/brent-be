What it needs: Place it in bright, indirect light or partial shade and well-drained soil. Feed once a month with a water-soluble fertilizer such as 20-20-20. Key to success: Display ‘Tiger’ fern in a location where it won’t get too hot, such as in the cool shade of a deep porch. Good drainage is critical as well.
