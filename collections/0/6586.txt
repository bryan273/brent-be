The NIMS program consists of the NIMS-700 and NIMS- 800 courses. For those agencies (Federal, State, County, Tribal, Local Fire Departments, etc.) that receive federal funding (i.e. grants, wildland reimbursement, etc.) NIMS 700 is required. All chief officers for those agencies need to complete NIMS 800.
