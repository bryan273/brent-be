pro riders set up and bike sizes. I've been searching the net trying to find the sizes used by some of the top pro riders with little success. Does anybody know a site with this info? Do pros use different size frames/set up depending on the type of stage. I appreciate the gearing may change but I'm more concerned about their actual fit on the bike.
