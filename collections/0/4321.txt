The Jews hate Jesus Christ because they do not like being in a position of “weakness.” For one to come to Jesus Christ he has to admit that he has sinned and in need of a Saviour and therefore must repent and correct his conduct.The Jews find this absolutely abhorrent. The Jews do not want a Saviour.asically we were told in our Jewish circles, “Jesus Christ is for the Gentiles not for us Jews.”. It wasn’t until I started college in 1968 that I was able to buy a New Testament and read about Jesus Christ. I was amazed at how “Jewish” the New Testament was.
