Clay roof tile has been used for centuries worldwide and for good reason. Both clay roof tile and its modern partner, concrete, are not only beautiful but also extremely durable. With proper building design and installation, tile roofs can last 50 to 100 years or more. They do not rot in wet climates and are not susceptible to destruction by pests. They can be used in any climate or region and can withstand the severest weather conditions, including fire, wind, and snow.
