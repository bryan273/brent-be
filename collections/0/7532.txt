Citing a Quotation or Paraphrase. When you quote or paraphrase from a source, include the authorâ€™s last name, date of publication, and page number with the abbreviation p. (use pp. if the quotation or paraphrase is from multiple pages in the source).OTE: If possible, you should locate the original source being quoted or paraphrased so that you can cite it directly in your paper and list it on the References page with your other sources. Citing Source Material without Page Numbers Some sources, especially online, do not provide page numbers.
