A priori and a posteriori. The Latin phrases a priori (lit. from the earlier) and a posteriori (lit. from the latter) are philosophical terms of art popularized by Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (first published in 1781, second edition in 1787), one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.
