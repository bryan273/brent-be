When the catheter tip is in the balloon, the wire can be removed, and the balloon should drain. If the above techniques are unsuccessful, 10 mL of mineral oil may be injected through the inflation port and will dissolve the balloon within 15 minutes. If this does not occur, an additional 10 mL can be instilled.
