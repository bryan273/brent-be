Shelf Life Of Dried Dehydrated Meat Jerky. Dried jerky can be stored for 1 to 2 months at room temperature; in the freezer for 6 months or longer. Vacuum package jerky to extend the shelf life! I store my dehydrated strips in glass ‘canning’ jars and use our FoodSaver vacuum seal jar sealer lid attachment on the jars.
