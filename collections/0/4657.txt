SLMB does not have a six month or annual standard. Example : Myrtle is paid bi-weekly through her employer. In December, she will receive three paychecks and her income will be higher than the 120% FPG standard. Action: Myrtleâ€™s total net income exceeds the standard in December. She is ineligible for SLMB in December.
