The original Hupa name for the Trinity River was the Hoopah River. It was also known as the Indian Scalp River when first crossed by the Jedediah Smith fur-trapper's party heading northwards up the coast on May 25, 1828. The Trinity River flooded massively in the Great Flood of 1862, wiping out the economy of the area.
