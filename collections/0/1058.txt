Rodeo Clowns by G. Love & Special Sauce. This was written by surfer/singer/songwriter Jack Johnson. Johnson played this song for lead singer Garrett Dutton after the two came back from riding the waves together. Love and Special Sauce had already built a huge college-based following, but Johnson was a newcomer.
