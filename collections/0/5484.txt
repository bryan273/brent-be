Changing Device Name from Settings: Note: You will see the option to change device name only if you have an Android device with Android 4.2 and above. The easiest way to change the device name of your Android device is doing it from the About screen itself. Open Settings on your phone or tablet, scroll to About and tap on it. On the next screen, tap on Device Name, type the desired name for your device in the text field and select OK.
