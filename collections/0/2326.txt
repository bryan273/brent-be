The Clydesdale is a draft horse breed from Lanarkshire, Scotland, and its name was inspired by the River Clyde. The Clydesdaleâ€™s history goes back to the mid-1700s, when native stocks were mated with larger Flemish horses and then selected for use in agriculture and for all types of heavy hauling, including transport through the streets of Glasgow.
