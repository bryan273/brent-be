Electric power is delivered to each substation at 138 Kilovolts (kV) and is converted to 7,200 volts. The city-owned primary power lines carry the 7,200 volts to transformers within a distribution system that converts the voltage to lower levels that meet our customersâ€™ electric power requirements.
