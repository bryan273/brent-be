The main symptom of sialorrhea is drooling, which may not pose a problem but is rather an embarrassment. It can lead to cracking of the lips and irritation of the skin around the lips. The skin may become infected if left untreated. Some patients may actually choke on the excess saliva which can lead to coughing.
