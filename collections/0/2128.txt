Your preemie's special challenges. A premature or preterm baby is born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy. Generally, the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of complications. At first, your premature baby might have little body fat and need help maintaining body heat. He or she might cry only softly and have trouble breathing. Feeding your preemie might be a challenge.
