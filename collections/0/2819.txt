Escarole is another chicory at its best in fall and winter. Fennel's natural season is from fall through early spring. Like most cool weather crops, the plant bolts and turns bitter in warmer weather. Figs have a short second season in late fall (the first harvest comes in summer) just in time for Thanksgiving.
