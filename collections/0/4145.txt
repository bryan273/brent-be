Smoking is well documented to increase the white cell count especially neutrophils. Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000. An elevated ESR, LDH or CRP would be helpful and would make inflammatory changes more likely although not conclusive.
