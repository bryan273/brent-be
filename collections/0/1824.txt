Assuming you are a residential parent of a child and have legal custody then you would have to make a motion to the court for a determination of child support from the other parent.f you are asking how to start paying support then you can file a motion with the court to determine custody, support and any other issue involving the child. I really cannot comment further on this limited fact situation. David Kennett-JD-Attorney at Law.
