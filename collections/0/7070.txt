What I do is that I mix Methylsulfonylmethane powder to water, for example teaspoon of MSM powder to 1 litre of water and you do not really notice any bitter taste on it. It also goes just fine with just one glass of water (might taste a bit acrid). Another option which I use is to put MSM on smoothies.
