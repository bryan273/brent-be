Best Answer: let x be the number 9 times the reciprocal of a number is 9/x x ÷ 9/x = 1 x • x/9 = 1 x²/9 = 1 x² = 9 x = 3 or -3. Source(s): gohpihan · gôhpihán 6 years. Ago thumbs. upeport Abuse. call the number n then 9 times its reciprocal = (9/n) The qotient of those two numbers is: n/(9/n) now set that equal to 1 and solve. n/(9/n)=1 multiply top and bottom by the LCD of n to get: n^2/9=1 now cross multiply and get: n^2=9 so n= +/-sqrt(9) Hope this helps.
