The severity of symptoms depends on whether the injury is mild, moderate or severe. 1  Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as a concussion, either doesn't knock you out or knocks you out for 30 minutes or less.  Moderate traumatic brain injury causes unconsciousness lasting more than 30 minutes.
