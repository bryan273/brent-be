This is how rent-to-buy works: for a set period of time, usually 54 months, you will pay a fixed amount to rent a car. By paying this monthly rental fee you will in fact be paying monthly instalments on your car. During this time you’ll have full access to the car and won’t be limited by a maximum monthly mileage.
