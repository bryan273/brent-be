1 You should not cite any particular author or authors for a Wikipedia article, in general. 2  Wikipedia is collaboratively written. 3  However, if you do need to find the list of authors of a particular article, you can check the Page history.ee Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia, Caution on academic use of Wikipedia and our General Disclaimer page, for more information. A wiki is an unusual medium, and as such doesn't conform well to the usual book-citation formats.
