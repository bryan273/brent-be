If all that needs replacing is the drain pipe right under the sink, a homeowner may only have to pay around $200 for the work. Contractor fees could push the price up a bit more, and the cost of materials varies by location. Those who are familiar with plumbing and have done similar work in the past may attempt the installation without help. However, this is one home repair job that often turns out to be bigger than it looks.
