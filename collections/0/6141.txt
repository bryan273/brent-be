Hurricane season starts June 1 and ends about Dec 1. The peak is about the 10th of Sept but they are common (for the region, not necessarily Jamaica) in Aug and Oct. Last year we were there the first 2 weeks of Oct the prior 2 years the last of Aug to first of Sept. We were there when Ike went by north of Cuba.
