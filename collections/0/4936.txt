A good way of checking the value of baseball cards is seeing what they're selling for on eBay. You can look up individual cards by searching the name of the player followed by the year and make of the card. (For example: Ken Oberkfell 1988 Topps.) But don't be deceived when you see individual cards selling for $1 a piece on buy it now..
