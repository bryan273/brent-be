A reduction in red blood cell transfusion for AUIGIB would have substantial financial implications. In 2013-14, an estimated 204,000 units of red blood cells were issued for AUGIB, costing £123.31 per unit. A 13% reduction, as shown in this trial, would lead to annual savings to the NHS of about £3.3m for the blood alone, which excludes laboratory and administration costs.
