Conservation means a lot to me because without it ecosystems would fall apart and animals will become extinct. People often care about cute big animals like monkeys, tigers and eagles but it is just as important to look after animals that are not cute as well, like jellyfish, wasps and cod. Conservation is not just important for animals but to all living things. Conservation is also very important to prevent floods, fires, new deserts and drought. It is important to protect habitats and natural areas like rainforests. If we allow the destruction of rainforests it will increase the production of greenhouse gases which make the world warm up.
