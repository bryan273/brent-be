I have recently changed dr's looking for someone not so eager to pass out pills for anxiety. My dr. looked at some old blood tests I took to him and ordered a repeat. My CBC came back with high WBC of 14.1, high neutrophils of 9.6 and high leukocytes of 3.57. The issue is I looked at some of my lab results since 2005 and everyone I seen shown a combination of 2 or 3 of these high on them all.
