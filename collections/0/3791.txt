In fact, mint is a plant that is very mild in the conditions it requires. Supply your mother mint plant with enough water: unlike other plants, mint needs a lot of water. You do not need to water it the whole day long; I do it only once a day or twice if necessary. Just make sure the soil is always humid. A dead mint plant probably hasn't received enough water or sunlight.
