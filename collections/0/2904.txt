A quick and easy way to check is to try putting a small magnet on the piece. If the magnet falls, your piece is solid brass and you should read on! But if the magnet sticks, your piece is brass plated steel and what youâ€™re seeing is not tarnish but rust. Take some very fine grade steel wool and buff away the rust.
