The cuticle also works with the stomata to help complete photosynthesis. After the stomata open and carbon dioxide enters the leaf, the cuticle protects the mesophyll layer, which contains the photosynthetic cells that receive and process the carbon dioxide to manufacture glucose. The cuticle is translucent, so it does not block the sunâ€™s rays from reaching the photosynthetic cells.
