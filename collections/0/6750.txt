Available with 3 or 4 wheels, Rollators do not involve the lift and drop that a standard step walker requires. This rolling function provides a smoother and more natural walking experience. The reason people choose the 4 wheel rolling walker over the 3 wheel is the seat and the wider base for extra stability. The reason to move up to a heavy duty rollator model from a standard size is the need to be able to hold the heavier size patient and the wider seat widths.
