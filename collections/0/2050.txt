One of the most common kinds of concierge services are those that come with cardholder benefits. Many credit card companies like American Express or MasterCard offer the help of a concierge to those who are cardholders. You can dial a call center and request assistance to get tickets to an event or show, dinner reservations or travel accommodations.
