What Are the Different Classes of Misdemeanor Offenses? Most states classify misdemeanors into four of five subcategories, according to the degree of severity of the offense. For example, misdemeanors are usually classified as Class 1 through 4 or Class A through D. Class 1 or Class A is usually the most serious type of offense and is associated with greater penalties.
