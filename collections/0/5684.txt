Turn the dehydrator on to its maximum setting; typically 155°F. Record the temperature once it has stabilized. In order to safely dry meat at home, your oven or dehydrator must be able to maintain a temperature of at least 145° to 155°F. Do not test the temperature when the dehydrator or oven has product in it.
