This is another great stretch to use for relieving the tension in your neck. Loosen up by shrugging your shoulders and rotating your head slowly in a circle. To begin the side-to-side stretch, slowly turn your head to the right until you feel your neck muscles tighten. Hold the position for five seconds, then return your head to the starting position. Repeat the stretch for the left side. Do 10 stretches for each side of your neck. You can use your hand during this stretch as well. Place the index and middle finger of your left hand on the left side of your jaw. As you turn your head to the right, press against your jaw to increase the range of the stretch.
