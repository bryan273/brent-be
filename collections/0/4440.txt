Hotel is new. Do not choose the cheapest rooms, try polulux (cost - 3200 rub per night). It has two rooms and looks really good. Breakfast is in the next building. Quite large (porridge, sandwich, dessert). Location is good. Walking distance - two nice churches, river and Ugol (the best restaurant in Kovrov). Staff is friendly.
