An Unconditional Acceptance of what is just as choosing to resist what is are nothing more than choices that we ourselves have been provided the right as well as the ability to make which determine what The Flow delivers to us individually. The Flow never rests...the process of attraction never fails. It's the nature of the Universe to multiply and consistently supply an abundance of whatever we choose for ourselves. In fact, faith and abundance is all there is. The Power of Acceptance is far more than a feel good philosophy.
