So while designers selling their patterns directly to EU customers through Ravelry would be responsible for having to handle VAT for all EU sales, a retailer like LoveKnitting is responsible for the VAT collection because it makes the transaction with the customer on behalf of the designer.hanks for your comment. The purchase price that customers see on LoveKnitting will always include VAT. How customers see pattern prices on Ravelry is still being worked out. Weâ€™re working hard to make it as easy as possible for designers on Ravelry to set their prices for patterns that will be sold on LoveKnitting.
