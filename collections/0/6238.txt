The Whoodle is a hybrid breed, a cross between the Standard Poodle and the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier. Because the Poodle comes in three sizes (toy, miniature, and standard), the Whoodle also comes in three sizes – miniature, medium, or standard. The Whoodle comes in three different sizes so you should choose a dog food formula appropriate for the dog’s size.
