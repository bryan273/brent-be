I recently had minor surgery and an endotracheal tube was used. The back of my neck is painfully sore as well as my jaw and throat. I am still having problems chewing food as it hurts my jaw. I had problems talking and eating the first two days following surgery due to an extremely sore throat and damaged vocal cords.
