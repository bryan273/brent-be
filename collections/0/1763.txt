MicroSpacerÂ® is an aerosol spacer device for use with metered dose inhalers (MDI). Using an MDI without a spacer often results in aerosol medication ending up in the mouth, throat, trachea, and even the stomach. In contrast, MicroSpacer very effectively delivers aerosol medication from your MDI directly to the lungs, where it is needed most.
