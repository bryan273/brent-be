1 Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. 2  Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on).
