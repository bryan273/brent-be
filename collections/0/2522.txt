A typical example, truly, of German Kultur! At midnight, on August 4, Great Britain declared war on Germany in defence of Belgium's integrity, which she, as well as Germany, had solemnly pledged herself in 1870 to respect. France and Russia also declared war on Germany, and Italy declared her neutrality.reat Britain is in a state of war with Germany. It was officially stated at the Foreign Office last night that Great Britain declared war against Germany at 7.00pm. The British Ambassador in Berlin has been handed his passport.
