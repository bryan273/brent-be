Share the Love: You may have seen the exciting news today from Casey over at Ravelry that we’re working with him and the team to give Ravelry’s independent designers the option to sell their knitting and crochet patterns through LoveKnitting to customers in the European Union (EU) come the new year.hanks for your comment. The purchase price that customers see on LoveKnitting will always include VAT. How customers see pattern prices on Ravelry is still being worked out. We’re working hard to make it as easy as possible for designers on Ravelry to set their prices for patterns that will be sold on LoveKnitting.
