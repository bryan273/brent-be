Watching the ships roll in. And I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah. I'm sitting on the dock of the bay. Watching the tide roll away, ooh. I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay. Wasting time. I left my home in Georgia. Headed for the Frisco bay. I have nothing to live for. Look like nothings gonna come my way. So I'm just go sit on the dock of the bay.
