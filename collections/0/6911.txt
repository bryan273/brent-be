In cases of severe head injury, neurosurgery is usually carried out on the brain. Possible reasons for neurosurgery include: a haemorrhage â€“ severe bleeding inside your head, such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which puts pressure on the brain and may result in brain injury and, in severe cases, death.
