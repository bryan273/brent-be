show more Dollar General sells Fruit of the Loom panties and Family Dollar sells Hanes panties. Are the Hanes and Fruit of the Loom panties that these stores sell just as good as the department stores? I have Fruit of the Loom underpants that are from Wal-Mart. I also have some that are from Dollar General.
