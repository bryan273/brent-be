There's a saying here in Utah: If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes.. Our weather is as varied as our terrain. Some of our mountains receive over 500 inches of snow in the winter. In the summer, parts of the state can reach temperatures well over 100Â°F. Spring and fall bring every type of weather imaginable.
