The tax must be paid to a state that does not allow California residents a credit against taxes imposed by that state. See California Schedule S for a listing of the applicable states. The income must have its source in the other state. California law and its associated case decisions are the authority for the determination of the source of income, or any matter affecting the computation regardless of any provision or interpretation of the law of the other state.
