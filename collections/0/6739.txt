Well, the 5lb. 2oz. eye of round roast went in the oven for 30 minutes at 500 degrees. After the two hour wait, the oven temp and the internal temp of the meat were both about 153. A little more done than I would have liked, but still very tasty and juicy.y eye round was just 2.5 pounds and I cooked it at the 500F for 13 minutes. I would go maybe 10 or 11 minutes next time for such a small roast. Served it with the mustard Horse radish sauce. Good combo, I'll do it again.
