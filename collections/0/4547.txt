The pubic symphysis is a nonsynovial amphiarthrodial joint, and comes from the Greek word symphysis, meaning growing together. The width of the pubic symphysis at the front is 3â€“5 mm greater than its width at the back.t is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to the external genitalia; for females it is above the vulva and for males it is above the penis. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris.
