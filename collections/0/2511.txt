The Big Mac itself is allegedly 530 calories. The Sonic Jr. burger is allegedly 360 calories in the minimal configuration, but you can add cheese, bacon, and another patty if you want to. The big danger with the McDonalds burger is the stuff they sell you on the side: the fries and the soda. A sugar-based soda is loaded with corn syrup.
