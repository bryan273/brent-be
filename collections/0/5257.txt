I am a gold buyer and the above answer is half correct. The part where you should take it to a gold buyer and have it tested is correct. The part where they think it is filled may not be correct. I have here a ring I just purchased that says 10k F I have tested the ring and it is pure 10k gold. No filled or plating.
