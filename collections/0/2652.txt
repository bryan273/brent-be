Hello everybody, I'm a newbie that is very much interested in bread making. I have a particular question about wholemeal flour. When my sis and I are in the UK, we buy and eat Wholemeal bread - which is delicious! My sis has problems eating whole wheat bread in the US, but no problem with Wholemeal bread at all. I'm unable to find wholemeal flour anywhere. Now I'm wondering if Wholemeal is just the UK term for Whole wheat.
