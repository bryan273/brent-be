Appearance: White smock, red kerchief, gigantic sombrero, cheeky grin, at least from his second film onwards. Just remind me of it? Called simply Speedy Gonzales, it showed him and his friends trying to cross the US border to steal cheese that was being guarded by Sylvester the Cat. Good old Speedy! He’s one of my all-time favourite pieces of 20th-century intellectual property. In that case, you’ll be pleased to know that he’s coming back.
