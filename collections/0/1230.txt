Explaining the Medicare Summary Notice. When you are enrolled in Medicare, and you receive health services, the health care provider directly bills Medicare. The Medicare program pays your health care provider for her services. You then receive a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), describing the services and cost of service. The MSN is a not a bill to you, but you should spend some time reviewing the information, nonetheless.
