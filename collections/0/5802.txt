The company that landed this “deal of a lifetime,” was called ECOtality (NASDAQ: ECTY). With close ties to Washington, the news wasn't necessarily a big surprise. It also helped that back in 2009, ECOtality was ahead of the curve on marketing its technology. As a result, what was once little more than a $2 tech stock soared to $18.60 a share.
