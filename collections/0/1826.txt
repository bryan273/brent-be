In the state of Texas, child support and visitation are two different animals. You need to petition the court for visitation. Once it's set, she will be required by law to follow the order. You can also contact the Office of the Attorney General for the state of Texas regarding support, if you wish.ust so you know, even if you're not paying child support you have a right to see your daughter. If your ex doesn't request child support, that is her business -- she is legally not allowed to prevent you from seeing your child.
