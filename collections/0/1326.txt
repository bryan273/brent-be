There are two places where the bicep muscle connects: the shoulder and the elbow. In your shoulder, tendons connect your bicep into the shoulder joint. In your elbow, tendons keep the muscle attached to your lower arm. We most often see bicep injuries at the connection point with your shoulder. Strains or tears can develop in the ligaments.
