Sherman Douglas was the ultimate floor leader, leading Syracuse to its best three year run in school history. 'The General' was an excellent ball handler, who was a clutch scorer during the crucial moments of the game. Douglas graduated from Springarn High School in Washington D.C., the same school that Dave Bing attended.
