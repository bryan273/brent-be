Just to add what's already been said, 600 grit will make the metal a white-ish color. This is about the roughest grit that won't look like a bunch of scratch marks or grain. Getting up to around 2000 will start to make aluminum shiny, but you'll need a buffing wheel with polish if you want to get a mirror shine.
