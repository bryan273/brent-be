No one knows what causes NEC. It may happen if not enough blood and oxygen reach your baby’s intestinal tissues. Then when food moves into the area, bacteria from the food can damage the tender tissues. This can harm the tissues and cause them to die. When this happens, a hole forms in the intestine. This can cause a severe infection in your baby’s belly (abdomen).
