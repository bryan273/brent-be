According to Kantar Media estimates, sports programming in 2014-15 generated $8.47 billion in sales for ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, accounting for more than one-third (37%) of the Big Four's overall ad revenue for the period. That marks a 35% increase from five years ago, when sports contributed $6.27 billion to the networks' ad sales kitty. For the third time in the past five broadcast TV seasons, CBS booked the most sports bucks, raking in $2.8 billion, up 11% versus last year's $2.51 billion.
