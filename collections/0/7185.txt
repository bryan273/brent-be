Your basic men’s sherpa jacket is thigh-length and straight-sided, with a full front zipper, slit hand pockets, and flap breast pockets. Most also have interior breast pockets — you get a lot of cargo space with your sherpa jacket. The collars are turndown and lined with the same sherpa lining as the interior. That feature is both decorative (it gives the coat a fluffy “winter” look) and functional (the fast-drying sherpa lining won’t get sodden from snow or condensing breath as quickly as a cotton collar).
