Although Frida's work, often fantastic and sometimes gory, has been described as surrealism, she once wrote that she never knew she was a surrealist until Andr Breton came to Mexico and told me I was one.. (The art of Frida Kahlo is a ribbon about a bomb, Breton wrote, admiringly.) However, Frida eschewed labels.
