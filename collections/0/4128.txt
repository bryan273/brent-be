Tip: It's actually a good idea to repot a large fern, especially if it is pot bound, unless you want to water all the time. The correct soil mix is essential to the health of the plant, too. To make a potting mixture suitable for Boston ferns, combine equal parts of peat moss, sand, and garden soil.
