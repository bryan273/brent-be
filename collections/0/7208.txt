Puscifer /ˈpʊsɨfər/ is a band (not a side project) of Maynard James Keenan, known for his work with the bands Tool and A Perfect Circle. As Keenan is the only permanent member, he considers the project to be his creative subconscious.. In light of this, Puscifer could be considered a pseudonym for his solo work.
