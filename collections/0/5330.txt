Allegory. Definition: An allegory is a story with (count 'em) two levels of meaning. First, there's the surface of the story. You know, the characters and plot and all that obvious stuff. Then there's the symbolic level, or the deeper meaning that all the jazz on the surface represents. The symbolic meaning of an allegory can be political or religious, historical or philosophical.
