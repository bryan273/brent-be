In the early years, all of a townâ€™s water might come from the irrigation ditch. In St. George, the city had a rule that first thing in the morning, families could fill their barrels with ditch water for the day. Mormon pioneers in Cache Valley, Utah, built the Logan/Hyde Park/Smithfield Canal in 1861-62.
