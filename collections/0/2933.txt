Lower the nitrite level. 1  You can dilute the nitrite level with a 25% partial water change. If your tank is new, try to leave the biological filter and gravel bed alone so the bacteria are not disturbed and will keep multiplying. 2  Filter out the nitrite directly using API Nitra Zorb filter media in freshwater aquariums.
