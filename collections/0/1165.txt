We prefer parents to use the infant's hunger cues as a guide to how much to feed, since the infant's appetite will vary from meal to meal. A rough estimate is as follows: Age 4 mon-offer 2-4 total ounces per feed, Age 5 mon-offer 4-8 ounces total per meal, Age 6 mon-offer 6-12 ounces total per meal.
