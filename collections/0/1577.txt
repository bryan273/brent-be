First-Year Applicants. Applying to college is a thrilling experience and we're excited that you're considering the University of Georgia. We want to do everything we can to answer your questions, guide you through the admissions process, and introduce you to UGA. In reviewing first-year applicants for admission, the University of Georgia sets no rigid standards for test scores or high school grade point averages that carry over from year to year. Admission is competitive as there are a limited number of spaces available in the first-year class.
