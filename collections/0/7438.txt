(TMFSchool). Jul 16, 2015 at 7:10AM. If you want contribute money to an IRA for your retirement, the IRS rules are (uncharacteristically) straightforward: You must be under the age of 70 1/2 (for a traditional IRA; the Roth has no age restrictions) and you must have earned taxable income.bility to deduct contributions to a traditional IRA may be limited or entirely eliminated if the working spouse contributes to an employer-sponsored plan. No effect on eligibility for spousal Roth IRA. Age Limits on Contributions Yes. Contributions are not permitted for a nonworking spouse beyond age 70 1/2.
