I almost never have time to knit for myself, but I dream about it constantly. I’ve got a few “ultimate projects” that I’ve wanted to knit for years.One is a long richly cabled coat knit in a charcoal grey yarn — something that I can wear throughout the autumn months here in New York.

I mentioned to a friend that I would like to learn to knit, and for Christmas 2003 she gave me a copy of Debbie Stoller’s Stitch’n Bitch book. A week after receiving the book I went out and bought my first skein of yarn (Cascade 220) and needles and began to learn to knit.
