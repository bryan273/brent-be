St. Anne. The name Anne derives from the Hebrew, Hannah, meaning ‘Grace’. Saint Anne was born in Bethlehem and became the wife of Saint Joachim from Nazareth, in Galilee. Joachim was a shepherd, given the responsibility of supplying sheep for the temple’s sacrifices in Jerusalem. They were both of the royal House of David, and their lives were wholly occupied in prayer and good works.
