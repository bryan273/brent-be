Liposuction in three areas of the body can range from $6000 to $8000, and in five areas, as high as $11,000. (Because most plastic surgeons offer “package deals” whereby a patient can have multiple areas treated while paying a flat fee for the operating facility and anesthesia, many choose this option.)
