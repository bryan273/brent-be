The lava flows associated with shield volcanos, such as Mauna Loa, on Hawaii, are very fluid. â—‡ A volcano composed of steep, alternating layers of lava and pyroclastic materials, including ash, is called a stratovolcano. Stratovolcanos are associated with relatively viscous lava and with explosive eruptions.
