Alpha Helices. The alpha helix is a rod-like structure whose inner section is formed by a tightly coiled main chain, with its side chains extending outward in a helical array. The alpha helix structure takes advantage of the hydrogen bond between CO and NH groups of the main chain to stabilize. The CO group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the NH group of amino acid four residues earlier in the sequence.
