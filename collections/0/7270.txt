Punctuate your sentence — that is, put your punctuation mark outside the end parenthesis. Ex.: According to the poem, “tender is the night” (35). 2) When you quote consecutive lines of poetry (lines that follow each other in the poem), use a virgule (/) to indicate where the lines “break” (are separated) in the poem. Then, in your parenthetical citation, list the first and last line quoted, separating them with a hyphen (dash).
