One of those physicians is Steven D. Knope, a concierge physician in Tucson, Ariz., who runs a full-retainer practice that is “completely off the grid” of third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and insurers. He charges an annual fee of $6,000 per individual or $10,000 per couple for full services.
