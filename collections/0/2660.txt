By this point the term passport was being used, although whether it originated with the idea of people passing through maritime ports or through the gates in city walls (portes in French) remains a matter for debate. A passport from this period, issued on June 18 1641 and signed by Charles I, still exists. From 1794, the office of the secretary of state took control of issuing passports, a function that the Home Office retains today.
