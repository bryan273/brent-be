1 Do not place the shoulder belt under the child’s arm or behind the child’s back.  Older kids get weighed and measured less often than babies, so check your child’s growth a few times a year. Generally, kids need to use a booster until they are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds.
