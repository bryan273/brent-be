I love that song and find myself skipping along the whole month of October to that tune while it jams out in my mind. So, it is with great pleasure that I introduce this awwwwesome and oh so very spooky Monster Mash Halloween Bow brought to us by the fabulous and brilliant bow maker…Mary from Little Mama Bowtique! Just try not to hum the famous Monster Mash tune while checking out this festive bow…I dare you.
