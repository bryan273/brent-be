A by-product of these tests is that you can find out the sex of your baby. The blood tests involve a study of your baby's chromosones: if a Y chromosome is detected, the baby is a boy while if there is no Y chromosome, the baby is a girl. These tests can be carried out from 10 weeks gestation and are close to 100 per cent accurate.
