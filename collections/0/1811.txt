Michael was born on April 15, 1797, the eldest son of Arnold and Gratianne Garicoits. They were poor and Michael was hired out as a shepherd boy to a farmer. His desire to become a priest always met with No, we are too poor by his parents, but his grandmother talked the matter over with the parish priest.
