Best Answer: It means a buyer made the seller an offer to purchase their house. The sellers accepted the buyer's offer. It is now in the 'Pending' status awaiting financing. It is off the market, pending mortgage approval. If the buyers can not qualify for a mortgage, the house will be back on the market usually in 30-60 days. Usually it is sold and you don't have a chance.
