Bronchiolitis usually starts with a runny nose and congestion. Within 2-3 days, the patient starts coughing, wheezing, and potentially breathing hard. The wheezing and tight breathing usually become worse over 2-3 days and then begin to improve. Overall, the wheeze may last up to 7 days, and the cough up to two weeks.
