One bantam was six months, the other was seven months, and the large fowl were both eight months old before laying. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
