It was during this tour that Dorothy met Harold Nicholas, half of the popular Nicholas Brothers dance team, and the two fell in love. When the tour was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe, The Dandridge Sisters returned to Hollywood and Dorothy left the act to work as a solo performer.
