Each state has different requirements for the amount and type of training needed, so professionals working in various states may have to go through several training programs. Security guard training programs often must be completed during the first 100 days on the job, though this requirement varies by state. Topics covered during the training programs include basic security techniques, investigations, report writing, patrolling tactics, firearm use and emergency procedures.
