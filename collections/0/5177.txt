On Monday the Type 2 Incident Management Team for the Funny River Fire at Soldotna, Alaska mentioned that the fire had crossed the Kenai River near Torpedo Lake. The map, above, that we found on the Teamâ€™s Facebook page (it is not on their InciWeb page) shows that the fire has become established east of the river.
