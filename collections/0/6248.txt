XLSX and CSV serve different purposes. XLSX is mainly for Excel operations, much beyond plain data. You have formulas, formats, pivot tables, charts, and VBA code in it. Itâ€™s not designed as a common data format for further data manipulation outside of Excel, although other tools can read plain data from it.
