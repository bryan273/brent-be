In that case, the organism can still create energy, but through the process of fermentation. Fermentation happens in the cellsâ€™ cytoplasm (not in the mitochondria) and helps generate only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (much less effective in generating energy than cellular respiration). Fermentation uses the pyruvate molecules made by glycolysis from glucose.
