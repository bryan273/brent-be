ESP stands for Electronic Stability Program, which is the stabilization feature built into most Mercedes Benz cars. If the car detects a spin in the wheels or the danger of skidding in a turn, the ESP light will come on, verifying that the program is taking control of the car. But what do you do when the ESP light stays on? If the ESP light on a Mercedes Benz stays on, try holding the ESP button down for a few seconds. If your car goes into a spin and the ESP light does not come on, it's time to see that repair shop too.
