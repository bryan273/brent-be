Technique. When people are procrastinating or will 'be back', emphasise how now is the best time to buy. All sales people know that 'there are no bebacks'. Invoke seasonal effects, such a Summer, Christmas and other holidays. Remind them of other short-term reasons, including sales, weather, and so on.
