Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Overstocking. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
