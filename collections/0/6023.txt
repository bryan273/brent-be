Follow these steps to check whether an unconscious victim is breathing and to see if they have any signs of circulation: 1. With the victim's airway open, look, listen, and feel for breathing for about 5-10 seconds by placing your cheek near the victim's mouth and watching for their chest to rise and fall. 2. Check the victim for signs of circulation, such as movement, coughing, or groaning. 3. If the victim is not breathing but does show signs of circulation, perform to rescue breathing. If the victim is not breathing and has no signs of circulation, perform to CPR.
