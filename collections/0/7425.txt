An opening in the Earth's crust from which lava, ash, and hot gases flow or are ejected during an eruption. A usually cone-shaped mountain formed by the materials issuing from such an opening. Volcanoes are usually associated with plate boundaries but can also occur within the interior areas of a tectonic plate.
