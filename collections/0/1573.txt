Demonstrated academic achievement is the primary factor in first-year admission decisions at the University of Georgia. The academic review of first-year applications centers on three criteria: the student's grade point average (GPA) in core academic courses, the rigor of a student's course selection, and his or her best combination of scores on the SAT I or ACT.
