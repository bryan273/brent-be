In most American households, heating is provided by one of two types of HVAC systems: a heat pump or a furnace. Both types of heating systems are effective and reliable.he heat pump contains a set of coils in the indoor unit and another in the outdoor unit. When the system is providing heating, the refrigerant in the outdoor coils is evaporated into a gas, which absorbs heat.
