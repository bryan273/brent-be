If you live in the United States, chicken is probably a staple in your diet, especially if you have implemented a healthy eating plan. Part of the meat and beans group of the Food Guide Pyramid, chicken is full of essential nutrients that your body needs, while carrying fewer of the unhealthy qualities that other meats have. A boneless, skinless chicken breast is an excellent low-fat food that can be prepared in a variety of ways and that fits into many different cuisines.
