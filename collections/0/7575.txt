microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation. In animal cells, miRNAs regulate their targets by translational inhibition and mRNA destabilization. Here, we review recent work in animal models that provide insight into the diverse roles of miRNAs in vivo.icroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation.
