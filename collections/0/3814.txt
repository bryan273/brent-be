The temperature falls at the adiabatic rate in unsaturated air till the base of the cumulus cloud is reached. Higher than this, the temperature decreases at a fairly uniform rate, but more slowly than the adiabatic rate. At the same time the utmost pains are taken to maintain the adiabatic condition of the metal walls.
