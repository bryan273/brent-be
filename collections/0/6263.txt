Only if the specific gravity of the liquid is very low or very high will the flow change by more than 10 percent from that of water. The effect of specific gravity on gases is similar. For example, the specific gravity of hydrogen is 93 percent lower than that of air, but it changes flow by just 74 percent. Carbon dioxide has a specific gravity 53 percent higher than that of air, yet it changes flow by only 24 percent.
