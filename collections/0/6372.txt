Like the little boy has seen the light. Cut from one face in the mirror to another. It is some time late in the night of 18 January or early in the morning of 19 January, 1996. We are in the bathroom of a Bel-Air mansion, and this guy, Don Simpson, is sitting on the john. He seems half asleep. A book slides off his lap - the latest biography of Oliver Stone.
