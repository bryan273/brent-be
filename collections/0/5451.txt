This cell wall exoskeleton provides the bacteria with several benefits. The cell wall protects the bacterium from damage by encircling it with a tough, rigid structure. This structure is also porous. Small molecules are able to freely pass through the cell wall to the membrane, but large molecules are excluded. In this way, the cell wall acts as a coarse filter.
