The Soviet-Mongolian War was a conflict between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Mongolia which began on 7 October, 1967, 50 years after the October Revolution. Though Mongolia was a communist state, democratic uprisings had been sweeping through the nation beginning that summer. The Soviets desired to put these uprisings down. Also, the Soviets greatly desired the oil and mineral rich lands on which Mongolia rests.
