Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. It is the most common treatment for a pituitary gland tumor. Surgery, which is performed by a surgical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating a tumor using surgery, is often successful in removing the entire tumor. About 95% of surgeries to remove pituitary gland tumors are done by the transsphenoidal route.
