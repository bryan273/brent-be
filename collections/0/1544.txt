To make a dispute online, you must have recently ordered a copy of your credit report. You can submit a dispute with the credit bureau who provided the credit report. To dispute via mail, write a letter describing the credit report and submit copies of any proof you have. The credit bureau investigates and removes the entry if they find that is indeed an error.
