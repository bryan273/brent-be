According to the former Disney Channel star, her dad Billy Ray Cyrus would call her Smiley when she was a baby because she always had a grin on her face. That was eventually shortened to Miley â€” and when she was 15 years old, she legally changed her moniker to Miley Ray Cyrus. Her middle name is in homage to her famous father and grandfather.
