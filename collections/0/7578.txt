miRNAs (microRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They generally bind to the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of their target mRNAs and repress protein production by destabilizing the mRNA and translational silencing.iRNAs (microRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
