How To Remove All Negative Items on Your Credit Report. WARNING: Disputing Legitimate Items (items that do, indeed, belong to you) is Fraud. Please do not attempt to remove items that you are sure belong to you. We are not suggesting that you remove all items from your credit profile, unless they definitely do not belong to you.
