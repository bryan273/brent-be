All ULS and ASR users that have existing licenses and were registered in the ULS TIN Registration database prior to December 3, 2001, were issued an FRN. Search by your call sign in ULS License Search (accessible from the ULS Home). Your FRN will appear on the License Search results page. If you do not have an FRN, you must register with the FCC. Once you have registered, you must return to ULS and associate any existing call signs you have with your new FRN.
