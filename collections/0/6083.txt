This process starts in the cells’ cytoplasm and is completed in the mitochondria-the cellular powerhouse. In those tiny organelles, one molecule of glucose with 6 molecules of oxygen are changed into 36 molecules of ATP – the energy cells can use to get things done. Cellular respiration is going on in every cell in both animals and plants.
