Why is the fitness industry as a whole so anti-alcohol? Isn't there any room for a drink or two at major events? What kind impact does that really have? The fitness industryâ€™s anti-alcohol stance is due, in large part, to the (lack of) nutritional content contained in alcoholic beverages. Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in drinks, has toxic metabolic byproducts called acetaldehyde and acetate.
