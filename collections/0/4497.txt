To make the bottle cap center you will need a 1 inch hole punch, an epoxy dome sticker, and bottle cap image. I found my image HERE. I also made a little glitter bow with a sequin to attach a Frankenstein Monster so she of course, had a bow too! Last but not least, take your choice of partially lined clip either alligator or French and attach it to back of your new bow. I used a French Barrett as this bow got heavy and is great for pony tails.
