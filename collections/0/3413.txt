If vengeance works anything like the demon hunting glyph. I'll no doubt go it and become a tank. Off course, if havok works in a simaler way, I may also go it. I liked the old demon hunting glyph, and loved tanking dungeons when I got the chance. My demon hunter, who will be accountant spec, is named Dilbert. Short, balding and tubby with thick glasses. He'll sit at a desk all day and won't even think about demon hunting because demons are scary.
