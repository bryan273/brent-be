Any exercise is better than none, and that helps your body slowly get used to being active. Your goal is to work up to half an hour most days of the week to get the full benefits from exercise. If it's more convenient, you can do short spurts -- 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there. Each action by itself may not seem like much, but they add up. Once youâ€™re in better shape, you can gradually exercise for longer periods of time and do more strenuous activities.
