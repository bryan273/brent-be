You Can Rise Again! Lakewood Church | by Joel and Victoria Osteen. When Jesus was on His way to be crucified, He was made to carry His own cross. He had been so beaten down that He couldn't carry it all the wayâ€”He fell down under the weight of His cross. Sometimes in life, the cross we're carrying can get heavy.
