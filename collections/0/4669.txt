When it's humid I use dehumidifier to help manage moist air. You can also speed up drying process by baking icing cookies at the lowest oven setting(mine is 170F) for about 10-15 minutes) A nice crust will develop on the top. Icing maybe still wet under the crust, but you can continue with a second layer of royal icing decorations.
