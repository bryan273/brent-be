Team RWB’s mission is to enrich the lives of America’s veterans by connecting them to their community through physical and social activity. Enrichment is defined as creating quality relationships and experiences that contribute to life satisfaction and overall wellbeing. The concept of enrichment consists of three core components—health, people, and purpose—that define a rich life. Enrichment Equation: Enrichment = Health + People + Purpose.
