Andrew Jackson, our seventh President of the United States, is a rather acceptable President. He was considered as the People's President, he was very straight forward and h â€¦ onest to his people. He takes his job seriously and is probably the most liberal president in history. His presidency however was neither a hero nor a villain, but shared a fair amount of each.
