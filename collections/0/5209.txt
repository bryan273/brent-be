Biological hazards reports. The European Union system for the monitoring and collection of information on zoonoses is based on Directive 2003/99/EC, which obliges the Member States of the European Union (EU) to collect data on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents, antimicrobial resistance, animal populations and food-borne outbreaks.
