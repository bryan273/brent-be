Backing up files. It never hurts to take security copies of important files, such as photos and financial data. One cheap and easy way to do this is to ’burn’ folders full of these files to blank CD-R or DVD discs. Backups need to be reliable so don’t buy the cheapest discs, and don’t use rewritable ones (eg CD-RW). Also, always use the ’write at once’ option and burn a whole disc, even if it’s not full. When you are saving data, it is not the time to save pennies.
