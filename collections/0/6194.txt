The optic nerve, which is a collection of retinal nerve fibers, conducts the electrical impulses to the optic chasm of the brain, according to the Vision for Tomorrow Foundation. Half of the retinal nerve fibers from each retina's inner half cross to the other side of the brain. The nerve fibers meet at the occipital lobe in the back of the brain. Vision is interpreted by the brain in the primary visual cortex. Each rod and cone, which are photoreceptors, in the retina is connected to the optic nerve by a tiny nerve branch, according to the Merck Manual Home Edition.
