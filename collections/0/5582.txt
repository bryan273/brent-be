Our brand new personal statement tool! You can write up to 4,000 characters of text that show you’d make a great student – so it might take a few redrafts until you’re happy with it. This tool will help you think about what to include in your personal statement, and how to structure it. It also counts how many characters you’ve used, so it’s easy to see when you’re close to that 4,000 character limit. Use our personal statement timeline to see when you need to get started.
