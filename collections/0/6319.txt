Form Your League - First, organize a group of people that want to play. Then, choose a commissioner and give each owner a copy of the rules. The ORBL's constitution is available in a book called Rotisserie League Baseball, and the ADRL's is in a book called How To Win At Rotisserie Baseball. Both books are revised each year and available in paperback at your local bookstore.
