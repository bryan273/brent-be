Women typically begin getting their periods anywhere from age 10 to 15. During the first two years after starting your period, your hormones may still be adjusting. This can cause late or missed periods. Menopause generally begins between ages 45 to 55. As your body goes through the transition, your normal cycle can become irregular.
