The northernmost of the Greenwich DLR stations, Cutty Sark is located in the Maritime Greenwich district of south-eastern London. Its name comes from the clipper ship named Cutty Sark which is housed 200 metres to the north of the station; in 2007 the ship was severely damaged in a fire that occurred during restoration.
