If you compare the gearing of the cranksets (keeping the same cassette in the rear) you'll see that the compact crankset is about 15% lower gearing than the standard, and the sub compact is about 8% lower gearing. This means that for every pedal revolution, the bike will move forward 15% and 8% less.
