Platform: PlayStation 2|Verified Purchase. 1  I have been a fan of the RPG Makers for PC for a long time, and to see that the PS2 also as an RPG Maker is a maker plus. This is a great idea for newbie game designers or even those who want to learn about script writing for games and even learn about how RPG games are made. PROS.
