Joe DiMaggio joined the Yankees for the 1936 season, making his major league debut on May 3 against the St. Louis Browns. He played with a talented team which included members Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It had been two years since Babe Ruth left the Yankees, and the team was in need of a new era of success.
