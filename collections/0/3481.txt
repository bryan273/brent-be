No-Fault Insurance Fraud in New York State is Ramping Up Premiums. Fraud is driving up the cost of auto insurance for New York State drivers, particularly those who live in New York Cityâ€™s five boroughs and its neighboring suburbs. As a result, some people are paying four times more for no-fault auto insurance than the state average and seven times more than drivers in Albany, which has fewer cases of fraud.
