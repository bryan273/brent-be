Wrist sprains can vary in severity. A mild or grade 1 wrist sprain may involve the ligament being stretched. Moderate or grade 2 injuries are partial tears of a ligament and severe grade 3 injuries are full ruptures of one or more ligaments. Grade 3 injuries may also involve an avulsion fracture where a fragment of bone is pulled off with the ligament.
