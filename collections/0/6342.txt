All chordates possess four characteristics that define the phylum, although in most species, these characteristics can only be seen during a relatively small portion of the life cycle (and this is often an embryonic or larval stage, when the animal is difficult to observe).ubphylum Urochordata. The most primitive chordates are the tunicates or sea squirts, and closely related groups such as the larvaceans (Appendicularians). In tunicates, the chordate characteristics can be observed only by examining the entire life cycle.
