Heart Dysrhythmias, Irregular Pulse, Missed beats and Palpitations. Contents. A normal person's heart should beat somewhere between 60 and 80 beats per minute with the rate slightly speeding up as one breathes in and slightly slowing down as one breathes out. Fit athletes have a slower pulse because as a result of training the heart beats more powerfully at rest.
