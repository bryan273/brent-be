Heat Resistance. Wet heat resistance is a notable characteristic of spores when suspended in an aqueous medium. Generally, wet heat resistance allows spores to be resistant to temperatures 40 degrees celsius higher than their respective vegetative form [11] . The major determinant of wet heat resistance is the core water content [10] .
