Cleavers make an excellent cleansing tonic that purifies the lymphatic system and urinary tract. Cleavers help remove toxins from the blood and intestines. They also make a cooling drink when treating feverish conditions. Cleaver tea is often used as a wash for burns, scrapes, abrasions, ulcers, dandruff, itchy scalp, and other skin problems.
