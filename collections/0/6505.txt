In criminal law, a misdemeanor is a lesser type of crime that is usually punished by a monetary fine and/or a short jail sentence of less than one year. A misdemeanor is a criminal offense that is less serious than a felony, but more serious than an infraction. Many jurisdictions set different classes of misdemeanors: high or gross misdemeanors, regular misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors. Common examples of misdemeanors include petty theft offenses, public intoxication, trespassing, displaying or distributing obscene materials, false imprisonment, stalking, and simple assault.
