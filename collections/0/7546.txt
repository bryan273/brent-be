An earthquake occurs when tension along a plate boundary becomes too great, the rocks slip releasing energy. When cracks form in the crust, or one plate slips beneath another building up intense pressure and heat, volcanoes can erupt. To understand volcanoes, students need to understand the plate tectonics connection.
