Talalay process latex was developed in the early 70â€™s and was pioneered by the new startup company Latex International. It really helped bring back latex to the forefront as a raw material used in mattresses. Essentially the Talalay process uses extreme heat and extreme cold during the vulcanization to produce very good cell structure.
