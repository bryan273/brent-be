No. Michigan law requires a license to practice athletic training. BOC certification is not a license issued by the State of Michigan. The Board of Certification is an independent organization that provides a certification program for entry-level athletic trainers; it is not a state licensing body. Proof of BOC certification is required in Michigan to show that you have met the educational and exam requirements for licensure. 8.
