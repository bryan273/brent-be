The standard score of a raw score x is. where: The absolute value of z represents the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. z is negative when the raw score is below the mean, positive when above. A key point is that calculating z requires the population mean and the population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation.
