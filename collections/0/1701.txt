amplitude is the height of the wave from the middle point, it can be either from the middle to the bottom, or middle to the top of the wave. the frequency is how frequent the â€¦ crests of each wave (the amplitude) pass a given point. so how they relate is, the highest point/lowest point is the crest, and the that is the amplitude is the ends of the crests ===== (In other words, to paraphrase the above remarks, there is no relationship between the amplitude and frequency of a wave.
