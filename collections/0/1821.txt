Mild aortic enlargement may not cause any noticeable symptoms at first. An enlarged aorta, however, may allow blood to leak back into the heart, due to aortic valve insufficiency. This can cause shortness of breath and a pounding heartbeat. More severe aortic enlargement can further weaken the aortic wall, causing the aneurysm to enlarge or dissect.
