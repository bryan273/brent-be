Your blood pressure numbers and what they mean. Your blood pressure is recorded as two numbers: Systolic blood pressure (the upper number) — indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) — indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.
