RE: How do you refill a Papermate Sharpwriter mechanical pencil? It&#39;s one of those pencils that retracts or advances lead by twisting the portion at the bottom, but I don&#39;t know how to refill it. It&#39;s got a spring and this little black lead holder thing inside, which holds only one piece of lead at a time.
