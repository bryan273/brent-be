It is the responsibility of the listing agent to bring offers made on the home to the bank or mortgage company for their approval or rejection. All short sales are pending the mortgage companies approval. The listing agent is just announcing in the listing that itâ€™s a short sale listing. If you make an offer for the property it may take weeks before you get confirmation that your offer has been accepted and your deposit will be tied up until you have confirmation.
