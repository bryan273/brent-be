Stool is usually brown due to bilirubin, a substance made from hemoglobin that is produced when the liver processes dead, used-up red blood cells and gets them ready for secretion. Bilirubin starts off as yellow before it is secreted from the liver as bile, which is yellow/green. When bile makes its way through the small intestine, it digest fats by breaking down lipid molecules into fatty acids.
