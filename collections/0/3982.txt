May 27, 2009 - Today, Jordan and I went to Stockley Park, the location of Hasbro's main UK office. We were able to sit in and film a design meeting where the Hasbro Monopoly team was hard at work planning details and logistics for new versions of the game that should be launching sometime next year.
