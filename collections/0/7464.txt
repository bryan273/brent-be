Miles And Miles. The familiar land mile is 5,280 feet, is called a statute mile, and it’s based on paces. On the other hand, the nautical mile is used for distances on the ocean and doesn’t have a tangible equivalent like paces. It’s a mathematical calculation based on degrees of latitude around the equator. The equator is a circle, which we know has 360 degrees.
