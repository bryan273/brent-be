Most civil court files are public records and may be viewed by anyone. To see a court file you must present valid picture identification, such as a current driver's license. A copy machine is available in the Records Unit and copies cost $0.25 per copy. Copy cards cost $1.00 and can be purchased at the dispensers located in Room 101. The dispensers accept only $1.00 bills.
