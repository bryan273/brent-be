The Whoodle is an intelligent, loving, companion that is easily trained. We do recommend that all puppies, regardless of breed, go through basic dog training. The little bundle of fur puppy does grow up to be an adult and what is cute in a puppy might not be so tolerable in an adult. It is important to train your puppy early so that you will have a perfect Whoodle for life.
