Wrist sprain explained. A wrist sprain is quite a common injury, which usually occurs after a fall onto an outstretched hand. Other accidents or impacts can cause a sprained wrist, although it usually involves the wrist being bent either forwards or back. A sprained wrist doesn't usually occur as an overuse injury.
