Usually when people think of the expansion of the canal they think about the bigger ships, says Arnold Cano, an engineer who's working on the project. Right now they can't fit through the Panama Canal. And that's a big aspect of the expansion. But really, the main driver for the expansion is capacity, being able to transit more cargo.. By adding a third lane, 50 percent more ships will be able to pass through the waterway each day.
