When it comes time to choose your travel dates, we help you find the lowest possible prices by coloring the best days to fly green. To qualify as a best day to fly, the departure or return date must feature a price that is relatively better than other dates around the same time. But please remember that we often do not display a price for every travel date. When this happens, we display the word price. Airfares may still be available on these dates. Simply click the word price to search our latest prices. To locate the best possible deals, you may wish to search a few days before and after your desired departure or return date to avoid peak travel days.
