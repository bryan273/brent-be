Answer Wiki. 6 Answers. Interesting question, which made me realize that my answer is: nothing, really. Despite living in Bavaria, which shares a border with the Czech republic, I don't personally know any Czechs and haven't been there. I don't even know any stereotypes about Czechs. All I know is some basic history, that they have good beer and Prague is supposedly well worth visiting.
