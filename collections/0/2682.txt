He was also great as Sid the Squid on Batman: The Animated Series. It's a shame he hasn't done much voice acting in recent years, hopefully that will change in the near future. Happy Birthday Matt Frewer! He just has this voice that oozes creepiness yet psychotic with a hint of comedy sprinkled into the mix. He was excellent in roles such as Jackal, The Leader and Panic.
