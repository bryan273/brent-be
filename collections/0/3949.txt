A catheter (thin tube) with a balloon attached may be placed over the wire. The balloon on the catheter will be inflated to widen your narrowed urethra. The stent will be put into your urethra, over the wire, to the area of the blockage. Once the stent is in place, the wire and catheter will be removed. An x-ray may be done to check if the stent is in the proper place inside your urethra.
