The towns of Monument and Palmer Lake have grown faster than El Paso County's 8 percent population increase between 2010 and 2015, said state demographer Elizabeth Garner. El Paso County as a whole has lagged behind state averages in terms of growth, between 2010 and 2015, she said, when the state grew an average of 1.6 percent and El Paso County grew 1.5 percent. But Garner thinks Colorado Springs and El Paso County have turned the corner in terms of new development.
