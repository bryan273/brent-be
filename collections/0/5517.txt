As derided as pop-punk often is among the more hardcore set - it's probably more true to the spirit of Johnny Ramone than a lot of other bands were. The Ramones certainly didn't originate the scaling down of rock music - that had already been happening with people like Jonathan Richman as far back as the early 70s. One could even make a case for bands like The Kinks being the first punk groups.
