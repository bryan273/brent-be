Japan is the 5th largest importer and exporter in the world. Like many of the other Asian countries that have experienced rapid economic growth in the past few decades, exports have had a historical significance to the Japanese economy. Japan imports raw materials and pays for them by processing the raw materials, thus adding value to them before exporting the output.
