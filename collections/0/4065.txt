Gerd Gigerenzer focused on the fast and frugal properties of heuristics, i.e., using heuristics in a way that is principally accurate and thus eliminating most cognitive bias. Heuristics – like the recognition heuristic or the take-the-best heuristic – are viewed as special tools that tackle specific tasks (e.g., binary choice) under conditions of uncertainty and are organized in an adaptive toolbox.
