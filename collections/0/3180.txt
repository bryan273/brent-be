You can refill them and I encourage you to do so. This video explains how to refill the pencil, complete with close-ups. Don't throw them away, refill them! Remember, the Paper-Mate Sharpwriter pencil uses 0.7mm lead. Standard Pentel lead will work excellent. The video was recorded with a Sony EVO-210 Video 8 8mm VCR.
