Whenever I hear the word corporate, I get the image of indoctrinated people working on bog standard computers within an eternal sea of cubicles. Each individual works continually with no expression. They simply do the job they are assigned to. They have no personal identity, only a corporate identity. Every aspect of their being has been conditioned so they are only compatible within a corporate environment. Every aspect of their lives is an extensive marketing campaign. They eat at McDonald's.
