Weil is less enthusiastic about white, or button, mushrooms, a species of mushroom that also includes Portobellos and criminis. “Button mushrooms do possess some health benefits, but not the general health benefits found in Asian mushrooms,” Weil says. Weil also says that these commonly available mushrooms contain natural substances called agaritines, which studies show may increase the risk of tumors in animals.
