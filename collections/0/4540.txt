How did each family do? In the 10,000 potential futures that I modeled, the Smiths ended up with an average net worth of $2.63 million. 50% of the time, they had more than $1.3 million, and 50% of the time, they had less than $1.3 million after 60 years. 70% of the time, they departed this earth with money in the bank.
