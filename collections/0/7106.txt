I'll try my best to explain :)   No one can make you feel like you are worthless unless you belive what they are saying. For example, if someone makes fun of a grade you goâ€¦t, you could take it personally and feel inferior, or you could choose not to care and you wouldn't feel inferior; you wouldn't care. Making the world better, one answer at a time.
