March 7, 2011 - I've written a couple articles -- one about the history of MONOPOLY and one about Under the Boardwalk, both of which were published in the March 2011 issue of Boardwalk Journal, a monthly magazine serving Atlantic City, NJ and the surrounding cities. You can read the article via their archives.
