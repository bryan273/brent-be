Culture and Sensitivity – “C & S”. Culture: You send a specimen to the lab and the labs job is to tell you what the organism is, a definitive ID based on gram stain, morphology and biochemical profile. Susceptibility: The lab also gives you the info on the antibiotic susceptibilities to know how to treat it.
