Dr. Fishbien and his team are friendly and very responsive to their patients. The office is well organized and the appointments were timely, no more than 5-10 minutes waiting time. Dr. Fishbien knew exactly whom (specialists) to refer to for his patients' problems and the referrals were approved within a day or so.
