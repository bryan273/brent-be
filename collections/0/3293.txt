Tonic Water. Just because it contains the word water in its name and is carbonated doesn't mean that tonic water is in the same category as bubbly waters. Unlike the other carbonated options, tonic water has a distinct flavor and it certainly can't be swapped out (or in) for carbonated water. Tonic water is a bitter drink (a result of the addition of quinine) which pairs particularly well with gin.
