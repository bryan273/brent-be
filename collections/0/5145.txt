Why is the acid-level important in winemaking? Low acidity (high pH), common in grapes that are too sweet because they were grown in excessively warm climates, lowers the amount of subtle flavours in the grapes and consequently in the wine. As mentioned before, there is an optimum pH for fermentation as well.
