Some characteristics of Central American phonology include: / 1 s/ at the end of a syllable or before a consonant is pronounced like [h], except in Guatemala and in Costa Rica. 2  j (/x/), is aspirated except in some areas of Costa Rica; it is soft as the /h/ in English (e.g.: Yahoo).  Use of seseo.
