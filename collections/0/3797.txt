Mint will grow in most soils - you've got yours in a pot, so you should use a potting mix - any will do. In a cooler climate it will take full sun. In a hot climate it does best in partial shade. Mints prefer moist soil with excellent drainage and the soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. Mint is susceptible to rust. Keep manure away and remove any yellow-streaked sprigs to prevent the spread of the rust virus.
