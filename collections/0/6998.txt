Retailers have different per unit prices on larger size or value packs of meat. For example, the 93% lean ground beef 1 lb. package is $6.49/lb. at King Soopers and Safeway, but the value pack of 3 lbs. or more drops to $3.99 on sale every 4-6 weeks, so you save almost 40% by purchasing the family pack on sale.
