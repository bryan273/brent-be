This sounds far-fetched to me. Agaricus blazei, sometimes called Agaricus blazei Murrill, is a medicinal mushroom known in Japan as himematsutake; in Brazil, where much of the worldâ€™s supply is grown, as cogumelo do sol or medicinel; and in the United States as the almond portobello or Royal Sun Agaricus.
