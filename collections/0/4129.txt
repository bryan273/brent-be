Most ferns like an evenly moist soil with regular waterings. Allowing the soil to dry out between waterings stresses these plants. Bushy ferns can be difficult to water. Try using a watering can with a long spout to direct the water to the center of the plant. Water generously, until it drains out of the bottom of the pot. Bathrooms and kitchens are good environments for ferns because of all the running water.
