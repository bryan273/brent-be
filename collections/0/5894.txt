Figures from music industry sources reveal the kind of money top acts charge to perform before wealthy fans. They range from “The Boss” Bruce Springsteen, who is understood to ask for at least £610,000 for an appearance, down to a bargain basement £1,000 for former X Factor cult hero Wagner. Springsteen’s fee also goes for Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Madonna and Bon Jovi. But the true cost can work out much higher.
