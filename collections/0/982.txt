Good morning everyone, this is going to be a short post about the retention offers I received on my 5 Citi credit cards. Before I go on, I highly recommend reading Doctor of Credit’s post on Retention Bonus Rules & Tips For Each Card Issuer – Get More Than One Bonus Each Year. I called Citi yesterday to tell them I was going to make a large “purchase” at Target with my Citi American Airlines Executive Credit Card.
