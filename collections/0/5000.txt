To help compare different orders of magnitude, this page lists lengths between 10−4 m and 10−3 m (100 µm and 1 mm). 1  100 µm – 1/10 of a millimetre. 2  100 µm – 0.00394 inches. 3  100 µm – average diameter of a strand of human hair.  100 µm – thickness of a coat of 1  paint. 100 µm – length of a dust particle.
