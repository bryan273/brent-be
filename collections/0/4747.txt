Currently, Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is the reigning 100-meter dash champion at both the Olympics and the world championships. Given those titles, many consider her to be the fastest woman in the world. Fraser-Pryce's personal best time in the 100-meter dash was set in June 2012 in Kingston, Jamaica. She completed the race that day in a blistering 10.70 seconds. Given that time, however, Fraser-Pryce is not the fastest woman in history.
