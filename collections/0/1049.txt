Listings with the status “pending release” (status 2) or “pending continue to show” (status 3) that state “no more offers” or “no more showings” are incorrectly classified. If the property is not available to show or not accepting offers, the status should be “pending no show” (status 4). A list of the different statuses and their uses can be found on the MLSListings Portal and below. Active – Valid listing contract exists and no offer has been accepted. Pending with release, continue to show (PR) or (Pend w/Rls) – Accepted offer on the property, and a release, “escape” or “kick-out” clause exists in a purchase contract that allows one party to withdraw under certain circumstances.
