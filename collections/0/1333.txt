Rotator cuff/bicep tendinosis is diagnosed by eliciting pain or weakness with stress testing of the rotator cuff muscles. There are two common tests used for diagnosis of impingement: The Neer’s Test and the Hawkins’ Test. The Neer's test elicits pain with passive abduction of the shoulder to 180 degrees.
