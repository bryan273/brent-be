The Church of the Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church, was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith. Smith claimed that God had led him to a new set of scriptures called the Book of Mormon. Further, Smith espoused polygamy as part of his utopian society. Smith and his followers were persecuted in Ohio and the midwest. In 1844, a mob murdered Smith and his brother Hyrum in Illinois.
