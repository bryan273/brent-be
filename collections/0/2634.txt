There are a number of reasons that you can ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit. For instance, you can ask that the court dismiss for: 1  Lack of Jurisdiction (ie if the court does not have personal jurisdiction over you). 2  Insufficiency of Service of Process (ie if the Plaintiff did not properly serve the summons/complaint).
