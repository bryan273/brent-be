Be careful with borax on carpet or yard, if dogs get in lungs, it can cause respiratory problems. I do use 1/2 cup borax in bath water for them once a week during flea seasonâ€¦then rinse though. Lavender spray is effective repellent. To make, use 1 cup of water and about 20 drops of quality essential lavender oil.
