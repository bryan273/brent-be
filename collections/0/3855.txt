Every fusion is energy consuming and part of the energy is bound in the created core. Cracking neutrons gives the energy back. The fusion is a energy consuming byproduct. It is a waste of the process, which is fission not fusion. Fusion reactors will never produce energy because they consume more energy! They are not real fusion reactors! Its fission!
