While theistic Satanists do acknowledge an actual deity to whom they are dedicated, that being has significant differences from the Christian Satan. Theistic Satanism does not promote murder, rape, evil, etc. Instead, their Satan is a god of things like freedom, sexuality, strength, creativity, hedonism, and success.n contrast to LaVeyan Satanism, which is atheistic and considers Satan merely a symbol for what their faith encourages, theistic Satanists view Satan as an actual being.
