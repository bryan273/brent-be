As an alternative to having the form notarized, a power of attorney may be witnessed by two individuals. If you are unsure of the language of a power of attorney form, and what authority it confers on you as the agent, have a qualified lawyer review the document. Typically, only the principal may revoke a power of attorney. A court may provide for revocation if a third party can prove good cause for doing so.
