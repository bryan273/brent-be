So happy to finally make the trip to pay my respect to those killed and Wounded Knee Creek on 12/29/1890 and burred here in a mass grave in this active cemetery. Also paid respect to some killed at this site in 1973 in a stand off with the Federal Government, the American Indian Movement and tribal leaders.
