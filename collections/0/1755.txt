Skin is the human body's largest organ. A surgeon prepares to transplant skin at a burn victim care center. Skin grafts and transplants help reduce infection and fluid loss (which burn patients with extensive skin loss are especially susceptible to), but transplants carry several risks, including bleeding, infection, and rejection of the graft.
