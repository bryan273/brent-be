In 1854, Walter Hubbard and his brother-in-law Nathaniel Lyman Bradley produced clocks, tables, frames, lamps, and desk sets, primarily made of brass and bronze, in Meriden, Conn. The value is based on the condition of the glass shade and the size of the lamp. The shade appears to be intact, and the lamp is a nice size.
