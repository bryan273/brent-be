Warriors' Phil Pressey: Signs camp deal with Warriors. by RotoWire Staff | Special to CBSSports.com. Pressey agreed to a non-guaranteed deal Tuesday with the Warriors that includes an invite to training camp, international basketball writer David Pick reports. Pressey spent time last season with the 76ers and Suns, appearing in 23 total games and averaging 3.4 points and 3.3 assists per game. The 25-year-old also appeared in 31 games for the Idaho Stampede of the D-League, posting averages of 13.7 points, 6.8 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game. Pressey's chances of cracking the Warriors' final 15-man roster out of camp appear slim at this juncture.
