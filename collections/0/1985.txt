However, that is counterbalanced by Long Island being far more out into the ocean than Whidbey Island, trapped far inland in Puget Sound. Long Island Sound is far wider than Possesion Sound, too. One superlative remains: Whidbey Island is indeed the longest island on the Pacific coast of the contiguous United States. This is mainly due to lack of competition from the almost island-free coasts of California and Oregon, though.
