When the plumbing is in working order, all that needs to be done is removal of the old sink and the installation of a new unit. However, if the network of pipes under the sink has any problems such as leaks or breaks, homeowners should expect to pay much more for the full job. The average cost of replacing a sink is around $2,200 while installing new plumbing may cost $2,116.
