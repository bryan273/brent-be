I know that figs are a low acid fruit. With lemon juice they can be processed in a boiling water bath canner. I have a recipe (Time-Life Good Cook series) for preserved green figs in vanilla syrup p. 147. No acid is added. The CB says to process as per directions on p. 30 -31. These pages do not address figs.
