The aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood to the rest of the body. In patients with Marfan Syndrome, the walls of the aorta are weaker than normal. This can cause the aorta to enlarge and stretch. An abnormal bulge in the wall of the aorta (an aneurysm) may develop. The inner and outer layers of the aortic wall can also separate (a dissection).
