Symptoms of ear infection include: ear pain, fullness in the ear, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, discharge from the ear, nausea, vomiting, and; vertigo. Symptoms may follow a respiratory infection such as the common cold. Discharge from the ear canal is often caused by the infection known as swimmer's ear (otitis externa). A painful ear with decreased hearing is often the result of otitis media, an middle ear infection.
