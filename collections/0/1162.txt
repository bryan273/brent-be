The term feeding schedule varies greatly according to the temperament of your baby and the time management of the caregiver. There is some merit to putting baby on a predictable feeding schedule. Offer solids at the time of the day when your baby seems the hungriest and you have the most time. Mornings are usually the time when most formula-fed babies eat the most.
