During stress, your body produces some hormones that increase the blood sugar levels, and at the same time, they inhibit the insulin function. As a consequence, you’ll have high blood sugar levels, which will help you face your “stress situation”. On the other hand, these levels can reach the highest peak (uncontrollable), and then, they are considered as dangerous high blood glucose level.
