27 out of 28 found this helpful. In both of my pregnancies, I took tests 1 - 2 days after my missed periods which both turned out negative. I waited about 3 more days both times and then each turned out positive. I guess it just depends on your hormones... by now, you should be fine trying another test. When in doubt, see your doctor.
