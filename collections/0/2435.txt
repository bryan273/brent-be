When speaking of Redwood tree sizes, one should distinguish between the two types. The Coast Redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest on Earth (the highest reaches up to 379 ft). The Giant Sequoia or Sierra Redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganeum) reach 290 ft (average) and have the biggest volume.
