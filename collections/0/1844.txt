Report Abuse. There's no right answer. Electricity has become steadily more available to more people in the world over the last 100 years. There's no one time when it went from generally unavailable to generally available.oes anybody know when electricity became available as a general household power source-as in changed from gas lamps, candles etc. Update: I do not mean when it was invented, I mean when it was available for any household (maybe in a city) to have access to it.
