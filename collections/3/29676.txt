Quantum Meruit. The Latin term quantum meruit, translates to “as much as he has earned,” and refers to the actual value of services rendered. The legal theory of quantum meruit holds that a person should not be obliged to pay, nor should the other party receive, more than the value of the services exchanged. This concept may be used as an equitable remedy in a civil lawsuit, often where the transaction for goods or services was done without a written contract specifying the amount due.
