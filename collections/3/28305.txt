A retroactive repeal means no estate tax for deaths as of January 1, 2013. The North Carolina legislature repealed the state's estate tax in July 2013. The legislation made the repeal effective retroactively, for deaths on January 1, 2013 or later. Previous to 2013 if a North Carolina resident died with a large estate, it might have owed both federal estate tax and a separate North Carolina estate tax.
