Some nest underground, in places such as abandoned rodent holes, under sheds and in compost heaps. Of those that nest above ground, some make nests in thick grass, while others make nests in bird boxes, lofts and in trees. One of the species which nests in bird boxes and lofts is the Tree bumblebee, Bombus hypnorum. With this species you may often see 'swarms' of bees flying around the nest (see the video at the bottom of this page).
