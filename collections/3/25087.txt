Video: Heart and circulatory system — How they work. Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist and located slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left side. The division protects oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood. Together, your heart and blood vessels comprise your cardiovascular system, which circulates blood and oxygen around your body. In fact: 1  Your heart pumps about 5 quarts of blood every minute. 2  It beats about 100,000 times in one day — that's about 35 million times in a year.
