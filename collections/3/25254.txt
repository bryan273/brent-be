The district cannot conduct an initial evaluation or a re-evaluation if the parents refuse consent. However, the district can conduct a re-evaluation if the family does not respond to the notice. If parents refuse to consent to the initial MDE or re-evaluation, the district can ask a hearing officer to order it.
