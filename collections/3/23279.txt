Don't read too much into stranger anxiety. It doesn't mean the child is going to be shy. It's just a phase they're going through. If your baby is frustrated, afraid, or in pain, don't hand her to an unfamiliar person. She needs you or someone she's comfortable with to calm her down. Watch your reactions.
