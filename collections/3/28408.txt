I live in a very noisy area,near the airport... there is constant traffic,noise,neighbours and what not..even till 9 pm at night..and obviously aeroplanes as usual. I bought a condenser microphone and it would pic up every little noise. It was so hard and those noise wont get away even after noise removal.
