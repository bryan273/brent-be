Cooking salmon in the oven can be tricky -- the key is how long to bake it. Knowing how to cook salmon in the oven is essential to mastering basic cooking techniques for weekday meals. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets, or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. Fillets can be baked at a lower temperature, if desired, with an increase in cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness. Bake a dressed salmon for 6 to 9 minutes per 8 ounces of fish. To test for doneness, insert a fork and gently twist. The salmon is done as soon as it begins to flake and becomes opaque.
