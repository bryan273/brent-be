These hearings are conducted by a civil servant called a Hearing Examiner at the state level and known as an administrative law judge at the federal level. Legislative hearings occur in state legislatures and in the U.S. Congress, and are a function of legislative committees. They are commonly public events, held whenever a lawmaking body is contemplating a change in law, during which advocates and opponents air their views.
