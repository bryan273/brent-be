The time is the same on all of the islands you can visit in Hawaii: Maui, Oahu (Honolulu, Waikiki), Kauai, Big Island of Hawaii, Lanai, and Molokai. Even if you spell it Hawii, the time is still the same. The State of Hawaii is in the Hawaiian Time Zone. Hawaii does NOT go on Daylight Savings Time. In the winter, Hawaii is 5 hours earlier than Eastern Standard Time, 4 hours earlier than Central Standard Time, 3 hours earlier than Mountain Standard Time, and 2 hours earlier than Pacific Standard Time.
