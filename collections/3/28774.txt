Unequal Comparisons with Adjectives. In English, we typically add -er to an adjective and combine it with the word than to make unequal comparisons. In Spanish, however, we can't just add -er to an adjective. Instead we need to use the word m√°s in front of our adjective. And instead of than we'll use que.
