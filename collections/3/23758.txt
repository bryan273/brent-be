Price: Friday's Cheeseburger and combo fries $5.99 at lunchtime (regular price $8.49). TGI Friday's isn't a place I have much of a history with.I've only dined there a handful of times, and have always ordered a simple pasta dish.GI Friday's wasn't on my radar as a place for a good burger, until now. The regular price ($8.49) is admittedly a lot less sweet, but it's comforting to know that when I'm in an unfamiliar city, there's always at least one option for a cheap and tasty lunch.
