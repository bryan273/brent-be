1300 BRUNY HOTEL. (03) 6293 1148. Here at hotel bruny we are obsessed with fressness and our food is as local as we can possibly get it.....where practical, everything is made here on the premises.here is no public transport to or on Bruny Island, so you will need to bring your own car or hire a car. Europcar, Hertz, Thrifty, Budget and Avis all hire cars in Tasmania and this can be arranged from all of the major cities and airports.
