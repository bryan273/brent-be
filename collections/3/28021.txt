Select the best arm for administering the injection. Choose an injection site that's free from scars, bumps and other skin irritations. Give the injection in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm, not in the surrounding fatty areas. Wash your hands well, and put on gloves. Clean the area where you will be injecting the medicine with an alcohol wipe. Let the skin dry naturally, as blowing or fanning will direct bacteria to the area.
