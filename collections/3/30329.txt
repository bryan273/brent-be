An aqueous solution is one where water is the solvent in your solution. For example...aqueous HCl is hydrochloric acid (which is a gas) dissolved in water. Liquid just describes the phase of matter (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). In a chemical reaction you would write liquid for a reactant that is a liquid, but not dissolved in water (or it is aqueous).
