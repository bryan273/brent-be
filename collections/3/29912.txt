If you want a certain sex for your baby, the day of conception can help you to determine what sex your baby will be. Your male partnerâ€™s sperm determines the gender of your baby. Each of his sperm has either male or female traits, and the one that reaches the egg first, decides which sex the baby will become. In other words, if a sperm containing male chromosomes reaches the egg first, a baby boy will be born.
