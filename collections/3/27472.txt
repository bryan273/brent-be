Answer: None of the retirement plans you mentioned requires that contributions be made by the end of the year. An IRA contribution can be made all the way up until April 15 after the end of the year for which you want to make a contribution. SEP and Keogh contributions can be made up to the due date for filing your tax return -- or the extended due date, if you've requested an extension for filing your return. Keogh plans must be set up by December 31, even if you delay making your contribution until later.
