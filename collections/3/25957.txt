Assets range in liquidity based on how hard they are to exchange for money. Items such as cash, gold or silver are considered highly liquid assets because they are exchanged relatively quickly with very little risk of loss. Land and housing are nonliquid assets, states AllBusiness, and it takes time and risk in order to exchange for higher-liquidity assets.
