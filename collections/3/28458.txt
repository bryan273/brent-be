Python Functions. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing. As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions. Defining a Function. You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python. 1  Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses 2  ( ( ) ). Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
