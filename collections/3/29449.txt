RADIOACTIVE MINERALS. Naturally radioactive minerals are not very radioactive! This is because they are formed from naturally occurring radioactive isotopes which, by necessity, have extremely long lifetimes - comparable or greater than the age of the Earth itself. The radioactivity of an isotope is strongly dependent upon its half-life.
