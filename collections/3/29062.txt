Emphysema is usually caused by chronic irritation of the lung tissue, most commonly by cigarette smoke but sometimes by environmental pollutants as well.It can also be caused by an illness such as asthma or tuberculosis, allergy or infection, or an inherited deficiency of a protein called alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT). Smoking Cessation: If the emphysema has been caused by smoking, the person must quit to prevent further damage. 2  Bronchodilator Drugs: These drugs, which are taken either orally or with an inhaler, help to relax and open air passages or reduce inflammation and swelling.
