When you hire an employee, you must have the employee complete a Form W-4 (PDF), Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate. Form W-4 tells you, as the employer, the marital status, the number of withholding allowances and any additional amount to use when you deduct federal income tax from the employee's pay.
