Remove ribs from refrigerator at least 30 - 60 minutes before you are ready to cook. Preheat the oven to 225F. Flip the ribs so that they are laying meat side down on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife and slide it under the white membrane on the back of the ribs so that the knife is between the meat and membrane.
