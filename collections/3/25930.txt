NPS/Jacob W. Frank. Glacier's weather is highly variable and can be extreme. Warm days and cool nights are the norm in summer. Even when it's in the 80s and 90s in the daytime it can cool down into the 40s at night. Hikers setting out on a warm summer day, should still bring along raingear and lots of extra clothing.
