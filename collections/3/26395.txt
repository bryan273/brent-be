Waiver of the 10% Early Distribution Penalty for Public Safety Employees Age 50 and Older. Section 828 of the Pension Protection Act waives the 10% penalty for early distributions made to “qualified public safety employees” who separate from service after attaining age 50 (instead of age 55, as was the case prior to the Act). 1  This provision applies to distributions made after the Act’s date of enactment (August 17, 2006).
