It is known that the parietal lobes mediate exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception, while interoceptive sensations are also associated with activations of the right insular cortex. This article will focus primarily on the parietal lobe, and the effect of parietal lobe lesions on cognitive, perceptual, and motor function. One of the primary roles of the parietal cortex lies in the integration of somatosensory and visual information that is needed for movement planning and control.
