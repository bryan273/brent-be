At the same time I tested several Horizon and ProForm ellipticals and the difference was like night and day. Of course, these are cheaper machines, but in this case you get what you pay for. 4. 20″ Elliptical Stride — I particularly liked the 20″ stride length, which is longer than most ellipticals. I am 5’8″, and it seemed very comfortable. When I tried a Horizon with a 16″ stride, it felt awkward and constraining.
