Mark the setting, then turn down the thermostat.everal adjustments may be necessary before you get the temperature you desire. 4.) Mark the new temperature. If you are satisfied with the temperature, mark the new temperature on the water heater thermostat with a marker, so that you can make adjustments in the future if necessary.
