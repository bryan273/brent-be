The lemonade diet was first developed by Stanley Burroughs. The diet works by cleansing the body of toxic materials, resulting in accelerated weight loss. The reason you lose weight so quickly is the severe caloric intake restriction over a short time frame. This dramatic calorie cut can result in a large drop in weight over a small period of time (a few weeks).
