There is the dir(theobject) method to list all the fields and methods of your object (as a tuple) and the inspect module (as codeape write) to list the fields and methods with their doc (in ). Because everything (even fields) might be called in Python, I'm not sure there is a built-in function to list only methods. You might want to try if the object you get through dir is callable or not. share | improve this answer
