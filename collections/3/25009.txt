As emperor, Trajan expanded the Roman Empire to become larger than ever before. He conquered Dacia (now part of Romania), which provided land for Roman settlers and rich pickings from gold and salt mines. He then attacked the Parthians, Romes old enemy in the East, who lived in what is now part of Iran.
