Once a tree is established, it does not have to be watered on a regular basis. Depending on the species, trees can grow extremely tall, such as the California Redwoods. Other species might stop growing at a certain height, as many ornamental fruit trees do. Trees do not grow all over. Instead, they expand at the edges.
