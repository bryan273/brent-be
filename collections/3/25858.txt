Similar to other nail abnormalities, Beau's lines can also signal a mineral deficiency. Beau's lines usually appear in all fingernails, but if the condition affects only a single nail, it may be a sign that a cyst or wart exists at the base of the nail causing pressure. It is important for those with unexplained fingernail conditions to visit a doctor or dermatologist a proper diagnosis. Treatments vary according to a doctor's analysis.
