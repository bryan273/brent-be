Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint rep payees for those individuals that SSA determines to be incapable of managing their own benefit payments. Each representative payee has a legal responsibility to use SSAâ€™s benefit payments for the use and benefit of the beneficiary only. There are two major types of rep payees -- individual rep payees and organizational rep payees.
