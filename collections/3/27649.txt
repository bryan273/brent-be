Wool Embroidery Types. Embroidery types rooted in folk art traditions are often worked in wool threads. Berlin embroidery and crewel embroidery, also known as Kensington embroidery, both derive their signature look from the use of wool threads. Bargello, a type of geometric embroidery, features wool stitches on canvas.
