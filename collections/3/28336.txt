Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance: 1  Use isinstance() to check an instanceâ€™s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int. 2  Use issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int.
