The python code you write is compiled into python bytecode, which creates file with extension .pyc. If compiles, again question is, why not compiled language. Note that this isn't compilation in the traditional sense of the word. Typically, weâ€™d say that compilation is taking a high-level language and converting it to machine code. But it is a compilation of sorts.
