I could put in a couple of new beams to try to level the floors upstairs, but it might not work. If I do a full foundation replacement, I'd definitely have new steel seamless beams put in. Based on the research I've done and the people I've talked to, I'd be looking at between 40-50k. It costs about 15k to pick up the house.
