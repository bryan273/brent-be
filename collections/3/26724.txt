Aortic calcification, either mural or thrombus, is a common finding in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Differentiating between the two sites of calcification is necessary in order to avoid confusing simple thrombus calcification with displaced calcified intima in aortic dissection.ural calcification was seen in all 152 patients with aneurysms whereas thrombus calcification was identified in only 33 (24%) of the 136 patients with thrombus.
