Trees that grow from seeds start out as tiny seedlings, usually growing directly under the parent tree--the tree that dropped its seeds. Often, those seedlings die because they are blocked from receiving sunlight and moisture. However, seedlings raised in nurseries usually do very well, depending on the species of tree.
