1 For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket costs for a pancreas transplant typically consist of doctor visit, lab and prescription drug copays as well as coinsurance of 10%-50% for surgery and other procedures, which can easily reach the yearly out-of-pocket maximum. The United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit organization that maintains the national Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, puts the average total cost of a pancreas transplant at $289,400, including procurement, hospital admission, doctor's fees, and immunosuppressants.
