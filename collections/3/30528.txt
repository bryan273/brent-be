Check the bite site to see if you left any of the tickâ€™s head or mouthparts in the bite. If so, remove those. Clean the bite site with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. You do not need to take medicine or see a doctor for a tick bite unless you begin developing symptoms or do not want to remove the tick yourself.
