A mastectomy is an operation to remove a breast. When part of a breast is removed, this is called a partial mastectomy. Radical mastectomy describes removing the whole breast. Preventive mastectomy may be recommended to help prevent breast cancer in women who are at a high genetic risk of developing cancer.
