I Love YouFilmed in County Wicklow. I watched this movie at least five times which is surprising as I consider it a chick flick and don't tend to enjoy those. I think it's a combination of the Irish scenery and the music - so much so that I purchased the soundtrack and listen to it still. While the story is a bit sappy, the true charm of this happens when in Ireland, particularly in the Wicklow area where you'll take a walk through the National Park during a flashback.
