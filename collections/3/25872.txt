  Under California Vehicle Code 22651(o) a vehicle on city streets with an expire registration more than 6months and 1day can be impounded.   I â€¦ suggest you always get a Temp. Reg from the DMV this way PD or any enforcement agency would have to wait another six months from the date of your temp. reg. number.
