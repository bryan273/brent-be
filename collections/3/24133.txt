Hello my loves! I have a new lookbook video up for you featuring a few of the outfits I wore on my recent vacation to the Maldives! Most of the time I was honestly just in a simple bikini and sandals but it was nice to wear some vacation wear as well :) It was one of the most amazing trips I've ever been on, and where Mo and I got engaged!
