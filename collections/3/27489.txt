Wayside Property, Inc., 2014 WL 6634324 at *7 (E.D. Cal.) (court declined to rely on the Real Rate Report in disability case litigated for noncorporate client).) Legal Billing Report. A third reliable source comes from Thomson Reuters, which several times a year compiles hourly rates from bankruptcy court filings by case and timekeeper. It used to be known as Westlaw Court Express but is now called the Legal Billing Report. Each report has two sections. One is sorted by region/law firm, and the other is by billing rate/region. This is the most granular of reports, including the names of timekeepers, law firms, and the case names and numbers of the matters.
