Causes of Gas and Bloating. Bloating in the abdomen is commonly caused by gas in the intestines. One reason for too much gas is eating foods that create gas. Swallowing air while eating is often done unconsciously and may result in frequent belching during or after meals. To avoid swallowing air, slow down when eating, don't 'slurp' drinks, and don't talk while chewing.
