If a bad oxygen sensor is aligned with the ignition system on a car's engine, it can retard or advance engine ignition timing, which can cause an engine to ping. Pinging occurs when an engine's combustion gases are ignited at the wrong times. bad oxygen sensor can impede the air/fuel mixture of an engine or interfere with the engine combustion, both of which can cause an engine to miss, or run irregularly.
