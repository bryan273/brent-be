This is especially important for patients on multiple medications: For statins metabolized by P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin), concomitant administration of medications that inhibit the CYP3A4 pathways (protease inhibitors, cyclosporine, amiodarone, fibrates) is problematic. The result is increased statin levels and increased risk for muscle tissue injury. On the other hand, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin (metabolized by CYP2C9) and pravastatin (metabolized by the kidneys) are considered to be safer statin choices for patients on multiple medications. 1 of 4.
