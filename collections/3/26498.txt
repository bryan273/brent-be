To prevent rust, iron can be coated to prevent its reaction with oxygen and water. One such process is called galvanization. Galvanization usually involves coating an iron object with a protective layer of zinc. The layer of zinc helps to prevent the iron underneath from reacting with oxygen and water to form rust.
