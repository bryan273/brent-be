3. I have Googled like mad, but can't find a clear answer on this! I bought a spaghetti squash about 5 weeks ago meaning to cook it and never got around to it. I have never eaten it before, and my husband was skeptical, so I kept putting it off. Anyway, everything I read says that it will keep a long time..eople used to keep squash and other foods in their cellars for long periods of time. If it's been kept cool, has no soft or dark spots on, and looks okay when you cut into it (today or tomorrow!!), I'd say go ahead and eat it.
