Lewis Runnion: Today I’m proud to say that we’ve employed nearly 7,000 veterans, and we’ve made a commitment to hire an additional 10,000 veterans over the coming years. Alex Rolinski: Bank of America has a great work life balance, so they’re very attentive to your home life and your family. Life is great, yea. I mean it wouldn’t have been possible, like I said, had I not gained what I had from the military and what Bank of America has been able to do for me. It’s just phenomenal.
