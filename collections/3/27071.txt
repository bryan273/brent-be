opiate withdrawal, hydrocodone, oxycodone, withdrawal. Details: I have had an addiction to hydrocodone for 2 years. I took 4 to 5 10/650's a day. I just got ahold of oxycodone 10/650's and for about 2 weeks have been taking about 4 a day. I'm out of everything now... Day 3 of W/D symptoms... ughhhhh. Is oxycodone worse to come off of than Hydrocodone... This is hell...
