The enzyme ATP synthase can be used to catalyse this reaction. Converting ADP to ADP is therefore a reversible reaction as one way is a condensation reaction and the other is a hydrolysis reaction. Cellular respiration can be used to produce ATP, along with carbon dioxide and water from the reaction of glucose and oxygen. Cellular respiration, however, is a series of reactions that occur in three ‘pathways’.
