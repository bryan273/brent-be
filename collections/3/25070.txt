The major route for endocytosis in most cells, and the best-understood, is that mediated by the molecule clathrin. This large protein assists in the formation of a coated pit on the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the cell.This pit then buds into the cell to form a coated vesicle in the cytoplasm of the cell.he major route for endocytosis in most cells, and the best-understood, is that mediated by the molecule clathrin.
