Using xrange is safe when dealing with larger numbers, observe below screen shots to see how memory is used for both functions. The range python function create a list with elements equal to number we given to that range where as xrange create one element at any given time. This saves use to reduce the usage of RAM. With xrange the memory usage is in control from below screen shot where as with range function, the memory hikes it self to run a simple for loop program from below screen shots.
