Many Americans are looking to raise their house foundations due to new restrictions from FEMA. If you want to improve your home and raise a foundation for this or any other reasons, it's an expensive but worthwhile process. Overall, you can expect to spend anywhere between $30,000 and $100,000 depending on the size of your house, number of floors and the size of your house's footprint.
