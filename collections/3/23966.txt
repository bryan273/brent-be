On average, financial analysts are much better paid than the typical worker. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median annual income for financial analysts across all experience levels, as of May 2012, was $76,950. Financial analysts at the big Wall Street firms often make much more, even during the first year.
