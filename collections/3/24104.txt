Rotator Cuff Injuries. DESCRIPTION. The rotator cuff is the group of four muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, providing strength and stability. Above the rotator cuff there is a bursa, or sac of tissue, that co-vers and protects the rotator cuff as it comes into close contact with bones around the shoulder (Figure 1).
