If you aren’t sure your patented idea can actually be produced, it’s just that: an idea. The other reason most patents never make any money is because inventors and entrepreneurs cannot — for whatever reason — pick up the phone and start contacting the right potential licensees. They may spend years developing a prototype, but won’t dial. You’re not in the game if you’re not making calls.
