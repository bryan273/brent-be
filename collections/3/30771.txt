Why would progesterone be prescribed during pregnancy? I'm having a surgery to remove a cyst in my abdomen. The doctors don't know whether it's a urichial or ovarian cyst but since it's so large (about 7.5 in x 3.0 in) it might cause harm to the baby. So the nurse called today and said I'd need to pick up progesterone before the surgery, but I have no idea why I'd need it.
