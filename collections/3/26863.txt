Exploration and Settlement of Pennsylvania. Like colonies elsewhere, European tumult shaped the nature and composition of American settlements. The Reformation touched off years of religious controversy and sent thousands in search of havens in which they could practice their beliefs. Pennsylvania received a wide sampling of these refugees, including Quakers, Roman Catholics, Puritans, Calvinists, Huguenots, and Pietists.
