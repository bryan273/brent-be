If you have a tax free component, this is regarded as a deductible amount for income support pension purposes, and reduces the amount of your assessable income. For example, an annual superannuation of $5000 less an annual deductible amount (tax free component) of $100 is divided by 26 fortnights. Note: If you have reached qualifying age or age pension age, depending on what type of pension you receive, the first $250 of your employment income in a fortnight is disregarded under the Work Bonus. 2  For further details, refer to the information about the Work Bonus in Wages and Earnings later in this chapter.
