Since the term Kc [H2O] is a constant, let it be symbolized by Kb, giving: Kb = ( [NH4+] [OH¯] ) / [NH3] This constant, Kb, is called the base ionization constant. It can be determined by experiment and each base has its own unique value. For example, ammonia's value is 1.77 x 10¯5. From the chemical equation above, it can be seen that NH4+ and OH¯ concentrations are in the molar ratio of one-to-one.
