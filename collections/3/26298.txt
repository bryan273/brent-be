Sometimes employees are required to use their own vehicles for work-related travel. This, of course, excludes traveling to and from work. Employers are required to reimburse employees for their mileage. Every year, the IRS specifies a rate at which employees can be refunded their mileage-related costs. The mileage reimbursement rate intends to cover the costs of operating a motor vehicle for business purposes. Mileage reimbursement offers benefits to both employers and employees. It encourages employees to make more business trips and support their companies without worrying much about the accrued mileage costs.
