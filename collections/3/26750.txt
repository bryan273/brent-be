Choose the Email Photo. (If you have MobileMe, you'll see you can also send your Photo directly to your web gallery -- more on that in a future post). Your photo will shrink a bit and a blank email message will slide up behind it. Tap on the To: field and start typing to bring up email addresses from your contacts.
