Q: The oven of my gas range takes a really long time to preheat. Sometimes, I'll leave it on for an hour and it doesn't heat up at all.f it doesn't draw enough amperage, the igniter won't send out the gas needed to light the oven. This is a very common problem in ovens and the repair typically costs around $150, though that can vary depending on the type and brand of oven you have.
