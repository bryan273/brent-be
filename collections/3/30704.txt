Weeks or months of slightly slower growth alternate with mini growth spurts in most children. Kids actually tend to grow a bit faster in the spring than during other times of the year! A major growth spurt happens at the time of puberty, usually between 8 to 13 years of age in girls and 10 to 15 years in boys. Puberty lasts about 2 to 5 years.
