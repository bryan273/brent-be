Water, if left alone in a zero-gravity space (or equivalently, when in free fall), will tend to form itself into a sphere. Since every molecule pulls on one another, and the molecules on the surface have no molecule to pull on them from the outside, this causes what is known as 'surface tension'. This is the reason why one can overfill a glass with water, past the top, by a couple millimeters. Now, since there is tension in the surface, water tries to minimize the surface (it is like a balloon with extremely flexible surface), and since a sphere has the least surface area for a given volume, it forms a sphere.
