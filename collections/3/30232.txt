Optimum take off angle. The take off speed of a male elite long jumper is about 10.5 metres/second in a run through (take off angle of zero degrees) and 3.5 metres/second for a vertical jump (take off angle of 90 degrees). This decrease in speed means that the optimum angle of take off is well below 45 degrees.
