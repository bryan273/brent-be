This tangy, tart, yogurt-like drink is teeming with good bacteria and yeast -- it contains more friendly probiotics than regular yogurt. Kefir is made by adding kefir culture (aka grain) to milk from a cow, sheep or goat, then letting the mixture ferment for about 24 hours. Once it's strained, it's good to go.
