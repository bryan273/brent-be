To treat second-degree heat burns with open blisters, do not remove any clothing that is stuck to the burn. Refrain from using water on the burn because it increases the risk of shock. Cover the burn with a clean (sterile, if possible), dry, non-fluffy bandage, such as a gauze pad. Do not put tape on the burn.
