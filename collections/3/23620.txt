Angel's Landing (view N from near trailhead) This strenuous route runs up a steep paved trail for 2 miles to Scout Overlook, an overlook on the edge of the ridge that connects Angel's Landing to the rim of Zion Canyon. The route then runs another 0.5 miles up steep, exposed ledges along the narrow ridge to the summit.
