When combined with a carrier oil (such as jojoba, sweet almond, or avocado), frankincense essential oil can be applied directly to the skin or added to baths. Frankincense essential oil also can be inhaled after sprinkling a few drops of the oil onto a cloth or tissue, or by using an aromatherapy diffuser or vaporizer.
