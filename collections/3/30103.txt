Henson Family tree. These 1999 photographs were taken by Aviaq II Henson* . She is a great granddaughter of Matthew Henson and an Inuit living in Qaanaaq, near Thule. This is one of the villages where Peary & Henson traded for Eskimo dogs, and hunted with the local natives. Aviaq took these photos for the website in the summer of 1999. These are Matthew Henson's direct descendants and some of their friends. Notice on the bottom of the page is Uussaqqak Henson, Matt's grandson! * She calls herself Aviaq II because she has a cousin also named Aviaq.
