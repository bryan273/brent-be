Frost Concerns. Do not move your geraniums outdoors until the danger of frost is passed. When this exactly happens varies from climate to climate, but can occur anytime from March, such as in parts of Florida, until July, such as in parts of Colorado.cclimate them to the indoors like you did the outdoors. You can grow them as houseplants in a sunny area of your home. Donâ€™t forget to keep the soil slightly moist and keep plants away from heat sources and drafts. Note that garden geraniums will die back like annuals if they are not hardy in your climate.
