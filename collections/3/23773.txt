The best course long term is harder to determine, as it is based on the income you will draw, the earnings/fluctuations of your account balance (for deeming purposes), changes in legislation/deeming rates, etc. At age 71 and purchase price of $250,000 you will have a deductible amount of $17,806.he calculation for the minimum is around $14,700. However using the formula, and a fresh start, my number is 15.49 and hence deductible amount for Centrelink purpose calculates at $26,469, which will suit me just fine as I need to draw that much anyway.
