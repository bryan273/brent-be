Income from a pension, income from a 401(k), income from an IRA and income from any other type of retirement account are all taxed at the North Carolina state income tax rate of 5.75%. Unlike many other states, North Carolina does not allow deductions on any type of retirement income. However, the North Carolina standard deduction is fairly large. It is $7,500 for single filers, $15,000 for joint-filers and $12,000 for heads of household.
