Both teams have made four appearances in the Hall of Fame Game. The Colts last did it in 2008, while the Packers havenâ€™t played in the game in 13 years. The other 32 teams start the preseason the following week, meaning Green Bay and Indianapolis will both play five exhibition games. The regular season kicks off on Thursday, Sept. 8 with a rematch of Super Bowl 50 as the Denver Broncos host the Carolina Panthers.
