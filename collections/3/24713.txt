lactation consultant. Yes, certainly. If you're doing a lot of pumping, try to mix batches pumped around the same time. The most common scenario is pumping on Tuesday and adding it to milk that you pumped on Monday. If the milk is already frozen, be sure that you cool the milk before adding it to what's already pumped. In other words, if you have 1 ounce pumped, cool it and add only that ounce to the frozen supply.
