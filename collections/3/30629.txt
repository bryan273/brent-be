Characteristics of Protists. Protists are eukaryotic organisms that cannot be classified as a plant, animal, or fungus. They are mostly unicellular, but some, like algae, are multicellular. Kelp, or 'seaweed,' is a large multicellular protist that provides food, shelter, and oxygen for numerous underwater ecosystems.he fungus-like protists are the slime molds and water molds. They are mostly single-celled organisms that live in the moist soil of forest floors and compost piles. These heterotrophs absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter and move in the same fashion as amoebas by extending and pulling with pseudopodia.
