Proteinuria is the name of a medical condition. It means protein is in the urine. As blood moves through the kidneys, the kidneys filter out waste products, excess fluid and salts. The clean blood cycles back through the body. Most proteins are too big to go through the kidneys, so usually no protein is found in urine.
