Each cylindrical unit within compact bone is an entire haversian system. The system includes lamellae, osteocytes, lacunae, canaliculi and a haversian canal. Lamellae are the thin layers that compile and eventually form bone. They contain collagen fibers that are arranged in a parallel array. Lamellae also contain a small amount of proteoglycans in addition to collagen.
