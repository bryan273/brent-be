1 The interest rate refers to the annual cost of a loan to a borrower and is expressed as a percentage. 2  The interest rate does not include fees charged for the loan. 3  The APR is the annual cost of a loan to a borrower -- including fees. Like an interest rate, the APR is expressed as a percentage. 2  Unlike an interest rate, however, it includes other charges or fees (such as mortgage insurance, most closing costs, discount points and loan origination fees) to reflect the total cost of the loan.
