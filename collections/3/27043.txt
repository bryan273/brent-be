A pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption.This physical process differs from fluorescence, phosphorescence, and other forms of luminescence, in which a material emits light. pigment is a material that changes the color of reflected or transmitted light as the result of wavelength-selective absorption.
