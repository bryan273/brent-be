The H.J. Heinz Company was founded by American entrepreneur Henry John Heinz, son of German immigrants. He began a small food business with his brother and cousin in 1876. Heinz Tomato Ketchup was among the company’s first products, and it is now Heinz’s most iconic brand, claiming more than 50% of the market share for ketchup in the U.S. Heinz eventually bought out his partners and established the H. J. Heinz Co. in 1888.
