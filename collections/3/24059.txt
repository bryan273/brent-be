The word for air (vāyu) or wind (pavana) is one of the classical elements in Hinduism. The Sanskrit word 'Vāta' literally means  blown , 'Vāyu'  blower , and Prāna  breathing  (viz. the breath of life, cf. the *an-in ' animate ').ʋaːyu]) is a primary Hindu deity, the lord of the winds, the father of Bhima and the spiritual father of Hanuman. He is also known as Vāta, Pavana (the Purifier), and sometimes Prāṇa (the breath).
