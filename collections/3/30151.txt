Every July – as welcome as summer itself – Ukulele Festival Hawaii presents the annual Ukulele Festival at Kapiolani Park on Oahu. Families jam the park. Ukulele fans wouldn’t miss it. Tourists follow the sounds of music. The music swirls over the tops of ironwood and monkeypod trees toward Diamond Head.
