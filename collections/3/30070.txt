Don't make any withdrawals before the age of 59 1/2. If you do, you'll have to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal fee. After 59 1/2 you can make penalty-free withdrawals. Keep payments to a minimum and watch your age. The savings penalty on IRA distributions is 15 percent for withdrawals exceeding $155,000 annually. However, this amount is tax deductible.
