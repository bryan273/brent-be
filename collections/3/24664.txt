The taxonomic kingdom Protista is a collection of single-celled organisms that do not fit into any other category. Protists are a group made up of protozoa, unicellular algae, and slime molds. We will concentrate on the animal portion of this group: the protozoa (proto = first, zoa = animals). Protozoa are the oldest known group of heterotrophic life that consume and transform complex food particles into energy. Although protozoans are only made up of a single cell, these organisms manage to perform all the basic tasks of life. The protozoa are divided into four major groups: the ciliates, the flagellates, the heliozoans, and the amoebas.
