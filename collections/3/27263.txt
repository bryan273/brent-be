A boost leak is an air leak in the intake path downstream of the mass air flow sensor (MAS or MAF) and before the engine cylinders. Because the car's computer fuels the engine based on (largely) the amount of air measured by the air flow sensor, air leaking out causes the incorrect ratio of air to fuel.asoline engine boost hoses should be dry or almost dry. Here is an example of a TDI intercooler which was leaking through the end caps. A spray bottle used during the boost leak test easily verified the leak. Your basic boost leak tester should have a gauge and a way to get air in.
