A saddle embolism is a clot that blocks both sides of an arterial branch. The classic example is a saddle pulmonary embolism that appears at the split of the pulmonary artery, blocking blood flow to the lungs by effectively plugging both branches of the pulmonary artery. This type of clot can be a life threatening medical issue, depending on where in the body it is located.
