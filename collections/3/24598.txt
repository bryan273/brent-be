Lithium is an element. It gets its name from “lithos,” the Greek word for stone, because it is present in trace amounts in virtually all rocks. Lithium works with other elements, drugs, enzymes, hormones, vitamins, and growth factors in the body in many different ways.ithium carbonate and lithium citrate have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But not enough is known about the safety of lithium orotate. Avoid using lithium orotate until more is known. Lithium can cause nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle weakness, fatigue, and a dazed feeling.
