A transverse wave is when the wave is vibrating perpendicular to the direction the wave is traveling. A longitudinal wave, also called a compression wave, is a wave in which the vibration is in the same direction as that in which the wave is traveling. How frequently a wave or vibration occurs during a span of time, determines the waves frequency. Frequency is the number of waves per unit time. The unit for frequency if a Hertz ( 1/second). The speed a wave travels is the wavelength multiplied by this frequency. The amplitude of a wave is the maximum distance the wave is displaced. Waves are characterized by several distinct behaviors. One behavior is interference. Wave will combine with each other, causing an interference.
