What is pertuzumab (Perjeta)? Pertuzumab is a cancer medication that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. Pertuzumab is used together with traztuzumab (Herceptin) and docetaxel (Docefrez, Taxotere) to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Pertuzumab is usually given after other cancer medications have been tried without successful treatment. Pertuzumab may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide. What are the possible side effects of pertuzumab (Perjeta)? Some people receiving a pertuzumab injection have had a reaction to the infusion (when the medicine is injected into the vein). Tell your caregiver right away if you feel weak, tired, or nauseated, or if you have a fast heartbeat, headache, fever, chills, muscle pain, or an unusual taste in your mouth during the injection.
