So range(5) returns (or possibly generates) a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (up to but not including the upper bound). A call to range(2,10) would return: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. A call to range(2,12,3) would return: 2, 5, 8, 11. Notice that I said, a couple times, that Python's range() function returns or generates a sequence. This is a relatively advanced distinction which usually won't be an issue for a novice. In older versions of Python range() built a list (allocated memory for it and populated with with values) and returned a reference to that list.
