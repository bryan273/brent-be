However, many popular apps have multiple versions available, so you can use them with more than one OS. For example, you may be able to play a game on your Android device with a friend that has an Apple® device because the app designer created a version for each OS. To find out if an app is available for your OS, visit the OS's storefront: Android - Google Play™ Store. Apple iOS - App Store℠.
