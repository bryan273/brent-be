For winter barley, October is the best time to plant. For spring barley, plant in January. Sow the seeds in the rows, ensuring that there are 20 to 25 seeds per square foot of space. Grow barley as you would wheat. Some varieties are spring planted and some are fall planted. Barley ripens sooner than wheat; spring-planted barley ripens in 60 to 70 days, fall-planted barley about 60 days after spring growth begins. Barley thus fits well into a double-cropping scheme and a variety of crop rotations.
