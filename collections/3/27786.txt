1 Do not list domestic or childcare activities on your resume. 2  Being a stay-at-home parent is an important role, but any attempts to spin it into a full-time job such as CEO of the Family or Domestic Engineer come across as silly. If you are applying for a specific job, tailor your resume to show that you are an ideal candidate for the job. 2  Most recruiters use resume scanning software so make sure to use the same keywords that appear in the job description. 3  Focus on your experience and maturity.
