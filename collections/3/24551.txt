LDL (Bad Cholesterol) Guidelines. For people at high risk of heart disease, the optimal level is considered 69 mg/dL or lower. People at some risk, but not high risk, for heart disease should aim to have LDL (bad) cholesterol levels that are 99 mg/dL or lower. Desirable for people not at risk for heart disease are levels between 100 and 129 mg/dL.
