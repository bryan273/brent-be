A flag holder offers a means to hold your flag pole or poles and fly your flag or banners by mounting to a post or a wall. Flag holders come in different orientations and sizes. A stainless steel flag holder holds a flagpole at a 45-degree angle. This flag bracket comes with a thumbscrew, and mounts with four screws or bolts or a stainless steel mounting strap (all mounting hardware is not included) for extra strength. Of these flag holders, you can select from a mirror or silver color. A single corner flag bracket is made of aluminum, and holds a 1.5 inch diameter pole at a 45-degree angle â€“ hereto, mounting hardware is not included. A double corner flag bracket has the same specifications, but is a two flag holder.
