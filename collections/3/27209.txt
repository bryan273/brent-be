At 37%, the recycling rate for single serve PET plastic bottled water containers has doubled in the last ten years. In addition, 3 and 5 gallon plastic bottled water containers are reused between 30-50 times before being recycled. Bottled water bottles are also the most frequently recycled PET beverage containers in curbside recycling programs, according to the National Association for PET Container Resources (NAPCOR).
