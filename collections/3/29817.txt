Standing or sitting for hours at a time without getting up and walking around can cause blood to pool in your legs and feet. This isnâ€™t a serious condition, it happens only because you are not moving around. You might notice that your feet are swollen and legs feel stiff and heavy. Just walking around gets your blood flowing again and the problem is solved. A hot and humid day can also cause swelling of the legs and feet.
