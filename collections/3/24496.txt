Hello, I have been diagnosed with intraductal papilloma. The surgeon's intern said it is not and will never turn into cancer and in no way indicates future cancer. It is 3.3mm X 3.5mm in the 3 o'clock position. The surgeon wants to do a partial mastectomy anyway. I am 52 years old, single and in good health but with only a small amount of friend and family support.
