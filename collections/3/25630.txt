Many bee and wasp species make nests with little rooms. Each room has just one egg and a supply of food (pollen for baby bees, paralyzed insects or spiders for baby wasps). The baby eats up its food, grows and transforms inside the nest, and emerges as an adult. These kinds of bees and wasps dig holes in the ground or in dead wood for these nests. Other wasps and a few bees (bumble bees and honey bees) make bigger nests, and bring their babies fresh food while the babies are growing. paper wasp nest in eaves. bald-faced hornet nest in tree.
