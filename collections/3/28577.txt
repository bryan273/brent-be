Track lighting is great for calling attention to a specific workspace, piece of artwork, doorway or architectural detail. If, however, you are looking for general illumination to light up an entire space, a standard ceiling fixture will cast a more dispersed glow. Voltage As with most home lighting, there are two basic types of track lighting systems: line voltage and low voltage. Line-voltage systems use the standard electrical wires and current in the home, which provides 120 volts to the fixtures. These type of track lighting installations tend to use incandescent spot lights or flood lights and have the largest light fixtures.
