By and large it is the man-made pollutions of waters that get the most attention, and perhaps rightfully so. But what is also important is the overall contamination, or natural quality of water that will help determine the treatments necessary to make a water safe for public consumption.n example of a point source of water pollution is a pipe from an industrial facility discharging effluent directly into a river. An example of a nonpoint-source of water pollution is when fertilizer from a farm field is carried into a stream by rain (i.e. run-off).
