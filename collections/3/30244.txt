Harvesting for silage should begin when the barley heads are well filled and the grain is in the late soft-dough stage -- when it contains 55-65 per cent moisture. Crops that are cut when they contain more than 65 per cent moisture should be allowed to field-wilt to that stage before being chopped and ensiled.
