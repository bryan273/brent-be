Some Endocrine hormones have an effect on the respiratory passages. This can affect the amount of oxygen that the lungs absorb. Your lungs are part of a group of organs and tissues that all work together to help you breathe. This system is called the respiratory system. The main job of the respiratory system is to move fresh air into and get waste gases out of the body. The nose (naval canal) and the mouth (oral cavity) are two ways outside air enters the respiratory system. The hairs in the nose are apart of the air-cleansing system. The throat (pharynx) collects air from the nose and mouth and passes it to the trachea. The voice box (larynx) is where the vocal chords are located.
