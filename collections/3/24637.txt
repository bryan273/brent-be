Keeping winter squash in the refrigerator makes them last only a tiny bit longer but alters the flavor and texture so is actually not recommended. For a long term option, cooked squash freezes great for 6-8 months (but raw squash does not freeze well).For cooking instructions, see how to cook spaghetti squash.f course, all foods last for a shorter period of time if they are not stored properly. Winter squash includes acorn squash, spaghetti squash, butternut squash, delicata squash, hubbard squash, kabocha squash, turban squash, sweet dumpling squash, and of course all types of pumpkins.
