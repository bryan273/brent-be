President Theodore Roosevelt was one of the park system’s greatest patrons. During his administration (1901-09) five new parks were created, as well as 18 national monuments, four national game refuges, 51 bird sanctuaries, and over 100 million acres (40 million hectares) of national forest.any native peoples were displaced and, when eastern parks like Shenandoah were created, so were settlements of U.S. citizens. But in the final analysis, America’s system of national parks became a unique triumph—and one that carries with it a great responsibility.
