My dog's laser surgery failed. He had cataracts, but the surgery brought on glaucoma (a possiblity they did not tell me about) then 2 more surgeries trying to relieve the pressure in both eyes, finally eye removal. Within 30 days my dog had 3 surgeries at a cost of 6K. If your dog is not in pain, leave him be.
