Sherlock Holmes didn't take a fancy to women unless in a case to help. He criticizes women's intellect until he has an encounter with Irene Adler who he referred to as The Woâ€¦man. Dr. Watson says this about Sherlock Holmes but it is never to be said by himself for your own account of the matter. Dr. Watson had hoped that Sherlock Holmes would take a liking to her, but he did not. Sherlock Holmes never married. But he was certainly respectful of Irene Adler's abilities and admired her.
