Kit Kat’s target market is men and women of all ages. The brand is youthful in nature, and focuses on the consumer segment who love chocolate, and are willing to indulge themselves with chocolaty snacks. What draws consumers to this brand is its association with “breaks” due to its tag line “Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat”.
