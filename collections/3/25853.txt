Hi! Splinter haemorrhages are tiny lines that run vertically under the nail. At first they are usually plum coloured, but then darken to brown or black in a couple of days. Cause of splinter haemorrhages is not always known. It is thought they may be due to a blood clot, or particles of fat that are carried in the blood and which become stuck in the nail bed. They can also appear because of injury to the nail, especially in manual workers, or as a result of an illness (such as arthritis or heart disease).
