What is the first name of Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. Watson? I have just finished reading THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and it never mentions his first name. It was my first sherlock holmes book and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle book, so if they mention it in another tale, then i have no knowledge of it.
