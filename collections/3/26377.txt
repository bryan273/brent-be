Yik Yak works by combining the technologies of GPS and instant messaging, allowing users to anonymously microblog to other nearby users. Before loading messages, the Yik Yak app determines the user's location and groups them into pockets of 1.5 mile (2.4 kilometre) radius zones. Within these zones, anyone inside the radius can post and read other people's “yaks”. Yik Yak is effectively an anonymous bulletin board.
