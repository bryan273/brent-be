Average male height for Americans. The average American height for men is 177 cm or 69.7 inches, which is approximately 5 foot 10 inches tall. (for white males*). A height chart for men of “White” race/ethnicity*, showing average height changes with age. (hint: 5 feet tall is 60 inches or 152 centimeters. 6 feet tall is 72 inches or 183 centimeters.) I don’t like charts, I don’t like arithmetic.
