In Europe, the three most important nations ruled by dictators were the Soviet Union, Italy, and Germany. In Asia, Japan also had a powerful new government. It was controlled by a group of military leaders who were preparing their nation for war. Russia was the first great power in Europe to become a dictatorship. For hundreds of years Russia had been ruled by czars. These czars had become hated. Russia suffered terrible defeats by the German army during World War I. This led the Russian people to revolt in 1917.
