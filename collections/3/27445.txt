OR place the bacon on a rack. Place the baking pan in the oven. 3. Cook bacon for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how chewy or crispy you like your bacon. 4. Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined platter. The extra grease will be absorbed by the paper towels, and the bacon will crisp up a bit as it cools. You can then transfer it to a clean plate to serve.
