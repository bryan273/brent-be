If you do not conduct the test properly you will not get an accurate score. Learn how to read your Radon test results. The first step is to determine which floor of the home to place the test. Place the Radon test on the lowest livable floor, which is usually the basement. If there is a finished room in the basement, such as an office, family room, computer room, or work-out area; that is where you would want to place the test.
