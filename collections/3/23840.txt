I would consider blood pythons to be one of the easier pythons to breed. Anyone who has any experience breeding other species of python, and even those that haven't shouldn't have too much trouble breeding blood pythons. For blood pythons, this involves having animals of the right weight and age. Males should be at least 2 to 3 years old and weigh at least 5 to 7 lbs, though larger is preferable and smaller is not completely unheard of. Females should be at least 3 years old and weigh 12 lbs, and no less than 10 lbs.
