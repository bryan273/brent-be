Emphysema, a type of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), occurs when the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs are damaged, becoming less elastic and, therefore, less able to exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. Smoking Cessation: If the emphysema has been caused by smoking, the person must quit to prevent further damage. 2  Bronchodilator Drugs: These drugs, which are taken either orally or with an inhaler, help to relax and open air passages or reduce inflammation and swelling.
