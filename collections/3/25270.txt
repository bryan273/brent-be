Moss is a relatively uncomplicated plant, lacking the leaves, stems, roots, and buds we often associate with â€œvascular plants such as ferns, pine trees, and flowers. As a non-vascular plant, the body of moss has no roots; rather, it uses tiny threads to anchor itself to the stones, trees, or ground where it grows. If you asked moss to describe its dream home, it would likely reply: cool, moist, and dark. Most species prefer shady ground, rock ledges, or tree trunks.
