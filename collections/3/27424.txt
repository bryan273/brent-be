Bladder infections are caused by bacteria in the bladder. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is usually the bacteria that causes a bladder infection. Bladders normally have a small amount of bacteria in them and urinating helps flush out the bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria grows so fast it causes a bladder infection.
