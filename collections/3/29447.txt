Any rock can be radioactive, but igneous rocks tend to have radioactive properties because they may have radon gas trapped in their crystals. When under pressure radon gas is released from the rock. Radon gas is a radioactive gas, when it is inside the crystals of an igneous rock it will make the rock itself radioactive. It changes over time as the unstable isotopes decay, thus the amount of radioactive element goes down, but the amount of the new element goes up.
