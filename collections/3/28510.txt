Smoke with a cooking thermometer to 145 degrees internal temp. Pull it out of the smoker and wrap in foil for 10 to 15 minutes. You will have a juicy pork loin/roast every time. Don't finish on a grill. smoked a 6 lb pork loin at 220 for 3 hours and when it hit 145, it was done! Rest 15-20 minutes and enjoy! I have found that many older blogs and comments still want to go to 160 plus-that's way too hot and way too long.
