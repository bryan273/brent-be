frange(), a range function with float increments (Python recipe) by Dinu Gherman ActiveState Code (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66472/) Sadly missing in the Python standard library, this function allows to use ranges, just as the built-in function range(), but with float arguments. All thoretic restrictions apply, but in practice this is more useful than in theory.
