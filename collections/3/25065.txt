Whether a cell uses facilitated diffusion or active transport depends on the specific needs of the cell. For example, the sugar glucose is transported by active transport from the gut into intestinal epithelial cells, but by facilitated diffusion across the membrane of red blood cells.y contrast, erythrocytes (red blood cells) and most other tissues in your body move glucose by facilitated diffusion carriers, not by active transport. Facilitated diffusion makes sense in this context because the environment is different for red blood cells and the gut.
