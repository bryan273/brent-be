Sweet orange oil is extracted from the fruit of the tree via cold expression; it is also possible to distill sweet orange oil. Use sweet orange oil in aromatherapy for the same problems as bitter orange oil; the main difference between these two oils is that bitter orange oil is photo-toxic whereas sweet orange oil is not photo-toxic (unless it is distilled).
