Bladder infections are caused by bacteria in the bladder. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is usually the bacteria that causes a bladder infection. Bladders normally have a small amount of bacteria in them and urinating helps flush out the bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria grows so fast it causes a bladder infection. Effects Bladder infections can cause a frequent or urgent need to urinate. They can also cause pain, itchiness or a burning sensation during urination. Urine can smell and look different when the bladder is infected. Like other bacterial infections, a bladder infection can also cause fever, chills and fatigue.
