Vegetables that Bunnies Can Eat. Bunnies can eat most vegetables, but some rabbits are more sensitive than others. If you’re not sure what your rabbit can eat, start him off with just one type of green leafy for a few days.Watch his poops to make sure he doesn’t get diarrhea, and if he tolerates that vegetable fine, you can add a second type.Again, watch his poops for a few days to make sure he doesn’t get sick. Most rabbits can handle vegetables that are high in calcium or oxalates, as long as these vegetables are served in moderation and the bunny doesn’t have kidney or urinary tract problems. 2  If you have a healthy rabbit, do not hesitate to serve him wonderful vegetables such as kale, just becuase they are high in calcium.
