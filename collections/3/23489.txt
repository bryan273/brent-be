The tip works like this: Preheat the oven to 325-350Â° Fahrenheit, place a whole (unbroken) egg in each cup of a standard-size muffin tin, then transfer the tin to the oven to cook for 30 minutes. Remove the tin from the oven and immediately place the eggs in an ice bath. Once they're completely cooled, peel and eat.
