8 Xper mho 21%. I personally think that the term junk refers to all of a guys gear. The penis, the sack, the balls, there's a lot going on down there. And it just sits there like a pile of junk, because it's usually just in the way.That's my take on it.1d. The first time I heard it was in the movie that the dude from Saved by the Bell was in... Mark Paul Gossalear, or whatever. It was something about college. Anyway, the one frat dude told the other dude to kick me in the junk, so since then, I've often called my nuts and dick my junk.
