Mechanic's Lien Basics. If you're a mechanic and are working on a project, and want to help ensure that you'll be paid regardless of the status of the property, you can use a Mechanic's Lien. A lien helps prevent the property owner from selling the property you've worked on without first paying you, the lienholder.
