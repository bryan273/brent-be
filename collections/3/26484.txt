In return, the Surety extends Surety Credit to make the required guarantee (the Bond). A claim can arise when the Principal does not abide by the terms of the Bond. In the event of a claim, the Surety will investigate to ensure it is valid.If the claim is valid, the Surety will look to the Principal for payment of the claim and any associated legal fees. Bond is not insurance, it is a form of credit where the Principal (you) are responsible to pay any claims. The alternative to a Contractor Bond is to post cash or a letter of credit. Surety Bonds are advantageous, as they typically require no collateral, which frees up capital.
