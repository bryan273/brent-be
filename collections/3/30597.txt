Lately I have reviewed multiple closed-end loan advertisements, with the same compliance issue â€“ not providing the required disclosures when a trigger term was present. A trigger term is an advertised term that requires additional disclosures. Trigger terms when advertising a closed-end loan include: (1) The amount or percentage of any downpayment; (2) The number of payments or period of repayment; (3) The amount of any payment; or. (4) The amount of any finance charge.
