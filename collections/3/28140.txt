An echocardiogram may be done to further evaluate signs or symptoms of these and other conditions. The echo can detect problems with the heart such as enlargement, abnormalities in motion of the heart wall, blood clots, and heart valve abnormalities. It also measures the strength of the heart muscle (ejection fraction).The echo is more accurate than an ECG, but also more expensive.
