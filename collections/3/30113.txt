Paleness (pallor in Latin) is abnormal loss of color from normal skin or mucous membranes due to reduced amount of the blood in the skin arteries. Paleness should be distinguished from other causes of prominent white skin: Fair skin is genetically determined skin hue with low concentration of skin pigment (melanin) in the skin.
