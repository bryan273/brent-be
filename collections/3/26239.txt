Well, like it or not, I have managed to break my wrist, so I will be taking that break from minis and from many creative pursuits that require both hands! I am still learning just what I can do with only one hand..... everything is a challenge! (Even typing this post is very slow and awkward!) It is a simple break, and should be better in about six weeks.... and I might be able to accomplish some mini things...
