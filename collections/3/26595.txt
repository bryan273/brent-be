The answer is 0.8. If that answer seems odd to you, think of it as a percentage. To see the test score in a common form, mentally multiple the answer by 100 and the answer is 80 or 80%. If the test above had no weight applied to any of parts, then the test score would have been 88%. Eighty-eight seems like a better score, but the 88% does not necessarily reflect the student's knowledge and skills as well as the weighted score of 80%.
