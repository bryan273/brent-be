Nanette Fabray. A sparkling, entertaining, highly energetic presence ever since her early days (from age 4) as a singing and tap dancing child vaudevillian, Nanette Fabray (born Ruby Fabares in San Diego) was once billed as Baby Nanette and working with the top headliners of the era, notably Ben Turpin, in the Los Angeles area.
