The story is set in 19th-century Louisiana. According to the Kate Chopin website, Chopin uses the storm to move the story forward. The storm traps Calixta's husband and son at a local store. Alcée arrives, seeking shelter from the storm. As Calixta and Alcée give in to their desires and have a sexual encounter, the storm mimics their passion in its intensity.
