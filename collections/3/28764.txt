Report Abuse. Lucario is a Fighting/Steel type Pokemon. The only weaknesses to this Pokemon are Fire, Fighting, and Ground type Pokemon. Water, Electric, Psychic, and Flying work normally, but any other type will have little or no effect. Also, neither his defense nor his special defense is that great.
