An aqueous solution is a solution in which a substance is dissolved in water. The substance known as solute is added to water, which is known as solvent in this case as it is in a greater quantity. All aqueous solutions include water as the solvent and are liquid in form. NaCl (aq.) is the most commonly known aqueous solution, where normal table salt is added to water to form a solution. The form is denoted as aqueous with addition of (aq.) to the name.
