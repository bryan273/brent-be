The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and the penis in front of the rectum. The urethra runs through the centre of the prostate, from the bladder to the penis, letting urine flow out of the body. The prostate secretes fluid that nourishes and protects sperm. During ejaculation it squeezes this fluid into the urethra and it is expelled with sperm as semen.
