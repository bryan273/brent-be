Re: Missed payment on HSBC Best Buy card. Give it a try. I have a best buy store card and was two days late making a payment. I had a video camera charged at 0% for 24mos. Nothing appeared on my account in terms of late fees or interest for a few days, and when it finally did I called the number on the back of the card.
