I’ve been using a sour cream muffin recipe from KAF’s Whole Grain Baking Book that calls for 1/2 stick butter and 1 cup sugar. I use a hand mixer for creaming, and it never works, no matter how soft the butter is or how long I run the mixer. The mixture is just too dry, and the mixer only spits out pebbles of butter/sugar.
