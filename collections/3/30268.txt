\nBut now I see, what one embrace can do, \nLook at me, it's got me loving you, \nMadly... \nThat little kiss you stole, \nHeld all my heart and soul. Heart and soul, I fell in love with you, Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, Madly ... \nBecause you held me tight, \nAnd stole a kiss in the night... Heart and soul, I begged to be adored, \nLost control, and tumbled overboard, \nGladly... \nThat magic night we kissed, \nThere in the moon mist.
