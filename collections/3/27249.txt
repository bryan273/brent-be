The leaves of the Black Gum Tree turn red or purple in fall, followed by small black berries, which wildlife animals love to eat, and the tree can grow huge in the wettest of soils but does not grow quite as tall on drier land. The Black Gum Tree is also called the Sour Gum Tupelo, and a rare tree to find in nurseries.
