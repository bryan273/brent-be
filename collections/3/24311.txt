My sister-in-law is conplaining about the same thing. Her oven takes 20 minutes to heat up to 350 degrees. I timed our oven last night and it took 7-1/2 minutes.I was suprised it heated up so fast. share | improve this answer. answered Aug 19 '14 at 20:36. user26639. 11 1. add a comment |. up vote 0 down vote. my electric oven takes 25-30 min to reach 350.t takes at least 20 minutes after the I'm fully heated beep before the stone is fully up to temp. We have problems with things baking poorly if we don't preheat for quite a while, but on the upside, if we put a cold roast in or open the door a lot, the temperature in the oven stays pretty high.
