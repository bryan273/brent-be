Great timing for me! I just put two 5 lb. port loin roasts on my smoker and was nosing around for opnions on how long to expect it to take and found this spot on discussion. One is brined for Canadian bacon and the other is spice rubbed for pork roast, using Ruhlman's 'Charcuterie' recipes (plus a maple syrup kicker). bought a 5 lb pork loin roast to use on my Traeger smoker. I've been searching to figure out how long to smoke it for, but I can't tell if its a pork loin or pork roast.
