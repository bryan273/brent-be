Formaldehyde is an important precursor to many other materials and chemical compounds. In 1996, the installed capacity for the production of formaldehyde was estimated to be 8.7 million tons per year. It is mainly used in the product of industrial resins, e.g., for particle board and coatings.In view of its widespread use, toxicity, and volatility, formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health. In 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as  known to be a human carcinogen .t is mainly used in the product of industrial resins, e.g., for particle board and coatings.
