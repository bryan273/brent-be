As I said earlier, if you know any other Java tips or best practice, which can help to reduce null check, then you can share with us by commenting on this article. 1) Call equals() and equalsIgnoreCase() method on known String literal rather unknown object. Always call equals() method on known String which is not null.Since equals() method is symmetric, calling a.equals(b) is same as calling b.equals(a) , and that’s why many programmer don’t pay attention on object a and b. One side effect of this call can result in NullPointerException, if caller is null.s I said earlier, if you know any other Java tips or best practice, which can help to reduce null check, then you can share with us by commenting on this article. 1) Call equals() and equalsIgnoreCase() method on known String literal rather unknown object.
