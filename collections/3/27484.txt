For firms that did not supply data to us, in many cases we were able to supplement billing rate data derived from public records. In total, we have rates for 159 of the nation’s 350 largest firms. Rates data includes averages, highs and low rates for partners and associates. Information also includes the average full-time equivalent (FTE) attorneys at the firm and the city of the firm’s principal or largest office.
