Recessed lighting can provide general, task and ambient lighting in a very subtle manner. Installed in the ceiling with only the trim showing, recessed fixtures can be used anywhere in the home, including outdoors, under eaves and on porches. They are ideal for any type of ceiling, including tall ceilings, shorter ceilings and sloped ceilings. They are available as downlights for ambient and track lighting, and as adjustable accent lights or wall washers for accent lighting. Undercabinet fixtures offer both task and accent lighting.
