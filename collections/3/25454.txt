Book Review: Never Never is the brain child of New York Times Bestselling authors Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher. Both have different writing styles and types of novels so I was intrigued to read the product of their collaboration. novella comes with the expectation that it will have a distinct beginning, middle and end (a small story arc). In part one, there isnâ€™t a complete story arc. Never Never ends in the middle of a scene. Many have called it a cliffhanger but to me it is more of a to-be-continued ending.
