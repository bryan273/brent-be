This study demonstrates several important points. First, fever occurs in most patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Second, many of the predictors of fever relate to brain injury, and not to infection, underscoring the importance and prevalence of central neurogenic fever. Third, there is a dramatic association between fever and poor clinical outcome, perhaps in a dose-dependent fashion.
