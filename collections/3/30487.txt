This new loan amount, along with the interest rate (5.00%), is used to calculate a new monthly payment ($1089.75). The APR is then calculated by working backwards to figure out what the rate would have to be for a loan with the new monthly payment ($1089.75) and the original loan amount ($200,000).This is your APR (5.13%). The APR is typically higher than the interest rate because it includes the fees.his question comes up a lot in Zillow Advice, so this post will help explain the difference between interest rate and APR (Annual Percentage Rate). Basically, think of the interest rate as the starting point in what you will pay for a mortgage loan and then, tack on associated fees to calculate the APR.
