What’s so special about Hawaii’s volcanoes? Hawaii emerged from the sea millions of years ago, forged by the power of volcanoes. Today, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Hawaii Island is one of the few places in the world where visitors can come face to face with an active volcano. This once in a lifetime chance to safely explore Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, makes Hawaii a destination unlike any other.
