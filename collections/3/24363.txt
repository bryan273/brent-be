The reason they believe this is because Jesus went to the temple when he was twelve years old. However, this is not a good argument, because Jesus went to the synagogue every Sabbath probably since the time He was born. Only God knows what the age of accountability is, and it is different with each individual. I believe this is because there are people who are severely mentally retarded who will never come to the age of accountability.
