Nanette Fabray. OK, one of you out there must remember this (and yes, I tried a Google search). Yesterday, a group of friends and I were watching an old episode of Let's Make a Deal (sad already, I know) and Nanette Fabray was the guest star. I was trying to explain to them who she was and where they may know her from. I knew she was a musical comedy star, and that she was a frequent TV guest star.
