I can never remember. On which side does one wear a flower behind the ear if a single woman? My friends and I want to wear flowers behind our ears for fun. A flower behind the right ear means the woman is single; behind the left ear she is married or not available. Associate the wedding ring on the left hand with the flower on the left.
