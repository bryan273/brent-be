In these mammals there is a considerable synthesis of bile alcohols, which are poorly solubilize cholesterol (2). In mammals that have the gallbladder (humans, monkeys, rabbits) both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic bile acids may be synthesized (table 2). The secondary hydrophobic hepatotoxic bile acids can be formed in large quantities, but they are poorly absorbed in the ileum and the colon (1-3).
