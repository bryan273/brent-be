The primary difference between an interest rate and annual percentage rate, or APR, is that the APR includes all financing costs on a loan.Comparing the APR on loans is typically the best way to evaluate alternatives, which is why banks are required to disclose the APR when promoting a loan.ecause APR stands for annual percentage rate, some borrowers get confused and assume APR is annual and interest rate is not. In fact, APR just refers to the entire financing charges on a loan, expressed on an annual basis. The APR takes into account upfront closing costs or loan fees you pay to get the funds.
