The first step to contentment is to make the Lord your Shepherd (23:1). The key to not wanting is to have the Lord as your Shepherd. Many people apply this psalm to themselves for its soothing effect, but they do not know the Lord as their personal Shepherd. Jesus made it clear that this is not a blanket truth.
