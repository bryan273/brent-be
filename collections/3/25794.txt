How much can the owner of a CPA firm make? I'm planning to get the CPA license and start my own small CPA firm. I want to hire bookkeepers and outsource the work overseas to save on overhead costs. I already have a large family of about 80 people, so I believe I can make at least 100 clients in my first year and do their taxes.
