The G20 I received from PING for testing had a 9.5* loft and a stiff flex shaft (58g) and it was tested in almost every condition possible.he G20 may not be the perfect panacea for helping you with your driving problems but it sure will try to as long as you give it something to work with. Overall. The PING G20 driver is a contender for a full time spot in my bag.
