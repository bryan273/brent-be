You’re wrong. Your due date is 38 weeks after conception (or 40 weeks after the first day of your last menstrual cycle). If you actually conceived on January 1st, you’d be due September 23rd. Your last period would have started about December 18th, but that’s not really when you would have actually gotten pregnant.
