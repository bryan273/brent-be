Your texting will work fine within your country zone. I guess that&#x27;s the deal you&#x27;ve been given. But If you sent one text message to an international number (ie, not in your country), you&#x27;d be charged for it. With whatsapp however, there&#x27;s no charges whatsoever. Just make sure you have a data plan.
