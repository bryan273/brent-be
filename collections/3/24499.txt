Double mastectomy not necessary for most breast cancer patients who choose it, study shows. Unless a woman is at increased risk for a breast cancer recurrence - because of a strong family history of the disease or because she carries the mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene - she doesn't need to undergo a double mastectomy. The findings of a study in JAMA Surgery show that most women who have the surgery don't need it.
