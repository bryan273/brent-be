There are two types of nuclear reaction, fusion and fission. Fusion is what the sun uses to generate energy --- the process in which light atoms combine and form heavier atoms. Fission is used in nuclear reactors and requires the atoms to be split, forming smaller atoms. There are four radioactive fuels used in nuclear reactors, although uranium is by far the most commonly used. Uranium is the most commonly used reactor fuel as it is the most common usable element. Different isotopes of uranium can be used, with uranium 235 the most widely used, although uranium 233 is also available for this task.
