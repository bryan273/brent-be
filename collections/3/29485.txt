In electrochemistry, the standard electrode potential, abbreviated E° or E⦵ (with a superscript plimsoll character, pronounced standard or nought), is the measure of individual potential of a reversible electrode at standard state, which is with solutes at an effective concentration of 1 mol dm−3, and gases at a pressure of 1 atm.
