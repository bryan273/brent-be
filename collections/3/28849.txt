The Life & Times of Ulysses S. Grant. Newly-christened Lieutenant Grant served in the Mexican-American War under Generals Taylor and Scott. Under General Scott, Grant was assigned as a quartermaster, which left him a little disappointed with the lack of action. He was stationed close enough to the front to see action, however, and fought bravely. He fought in the battles of Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey, Palo Alto (pictured below) and Veracruz.
