Security Ratings. Security Ratings and Standards. Locks and safes are standardized and rated by their ability to resist attack from pre-defined compromise techniques. The rating given to a particular lock or safe is a measure of the level of protection it is meant to provide, usually measured in time. Many government and law enforcement agencies use these ratings to select their own locks as well as recommend them to the public.
