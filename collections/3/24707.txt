Once they are at the same temp in the fridge - combine them - then freeze that way you will have 4oz. of milk per bag. I have been told you can mix different days of pumped milk as long as they are not over 3 days old and as long as they are the same temp. You almost have to because you usually need more milk per feeding than you can pump at once it shouldn't matter if you mix it before you freeze it or after in the bottle. Helpful (8)
