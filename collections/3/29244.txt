Carbon Monoxide Detector Requirements, Laws and Regulations. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious public health concern. More than 10,000 people are poisoned by carbon monoxide and require medical treatment each year. More than 500 people in the U.S. die annually from carbon monoxide poisoning. In light of the number of illnesses and death caused by high levels of carbon monoxide in homes and buildings, state legislatures have begun adopting laws mandating the use of carbon monoxide detectors. The requirements vary.
