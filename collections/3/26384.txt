Yaks are multipurpose animals. Yak meat is a unique choice for those interested in an alternative to traditional beef and bison. Most yak producers adhere to a free-range, grass-fed regimen that yields a lean and flavorful product. Yak milk is high in butter fat and produces exceptional cheeses, butter, and yogurt.
