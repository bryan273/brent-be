Prostacyclin acts predominantly on two receptor types: cell surface prostacyclin (IP) receptors and intracellular peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)β/δ. There are a range of synthetic and naturally occurring prostanoid and non-prostanoid ligands which activate IP receptors and/or PPARβ .
