Nicotine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, (a Na⁺/K⁺ ionophore through neural postsynaptic membranes in mammals and insects) except at nAChRα9 and nAChRα10 where it acts as an antagonist. It is made in the roots of and accumulates in the leaves of the nightshade family of plants.
