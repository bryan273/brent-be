Employers who withhold income tax on wages, or who must pay social security or Medicare tax, must file Form 941 each calendar quarter. After you file the first Form 941, you must file a return for each quarter, even if you have no taxes to report (but see the seasonal employers and final return information below).o not include tips on this line. Stop reporting an employee's wages (including tips) when they reach $84,900 for 2002. However, continue to withhold income and Medicare tax for the whole year on wages and tips even when the social security wage base of $84,900 is reached.
