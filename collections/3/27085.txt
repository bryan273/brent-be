Heat Pumps. Heat pumps offer a heating solution for homes with no access to natural gas. If you need a reliable, efficient solution for heating and cooling, you’re in the right place. As the name suggests, heat pumps move heat from one place to another. Even in air that seems cold, heat energy is present. When it’s cold outside, heat pumps extract outside heat and transfer it inside.
