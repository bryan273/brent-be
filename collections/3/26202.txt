Back in 2013, upon the advice of our Board Director, George Weiner, America’s Charities applied for a $10,000 per month Nonprofit AdWords grant from Google, and simply put - the results have been awesome! You see in 2012, our website attracted between 4,000 – 9,000 page views per month and 39,000 total visitors that year.
