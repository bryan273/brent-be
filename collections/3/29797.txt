The word glycolysis means splitting of sugar.. A cell invests two ATP molecules to break down glucose. The products of glycolysis are two pyruvic acid molecules, two NADH molecules and four ATP molecules. Using two ATP molecules as an initial investment, the cell splits a six-carbon glucose molecule in half. The result is two three-carbon molecules, each with one phosphate group.
