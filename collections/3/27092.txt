Constructive interference is when two or more waves combine, and the amplitude of their resultant wave increases. Destructive interference is when two or more waves combine and the amplitude of their resultant wave decreases. Waves will also diffract. Diffraction is the bending of waves when they hit a barrier. Sound is the result of vibrations in molecules causing the molecules to compress and retract, making sound a longitudinal wave.
