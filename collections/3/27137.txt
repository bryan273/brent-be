Scientists discover what makes human embryo attach to uterus. A UCSF-led research team has identified the first molecular step that allows a week-old human embryo to attach to the uterus. The finding is expected to provide a new tool to diagnose and treat infertility and early pregnancy loss, the scientists report. The researchers found convincing evidence that a molecular sticking process stops the embryo’s journey along the uterine wall and starts attaching it to the wall—the first stage of implantation. Failure of the embryo to implant causes about three-fourths of lost pregnancies.
