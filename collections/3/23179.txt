The pupil is the circular hole at the very center of your eye, surrounded by the colored area known as the iris. The iris is made up of small muscle fibers that control the size of the pupil, thereby controlling the amount of light allowed to reach the retina, the sensory area at the back of the eye. Normal pupils get smaller, or constrict, with bright light levels, and enlarge, or dilate, with low or dim light. Changes in pupil size also occur with focusing your eyes and in response to emotion. Pupil dilation can also result from a variety medications or drugs.
