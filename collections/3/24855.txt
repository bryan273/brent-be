You can get leaner cuts of meat in non-halal meat markets if that is your concern. Machines can be used in halal slaughterhouses to disassemble the carcass after the animal has been killed. Islam is not a race – it is an ideology.alal slaughter requires that Muslims perform all halal rituals. The end result is that Muslims begin to “take over” food production jobs of a nation. The idea that Muslims – who wish to eliminate non-Muslims – control any aspect of non-Muslim food production is disturbing.
