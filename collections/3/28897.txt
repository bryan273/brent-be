| Aromatic reactions |. The lack of reactivity of arenes is notable when compared to the reactivities of typical compounds containing multiple conjugated double bonds. For example, 1,3,5-hexatriene is much more reactive than hexane, hexene, or any hexadiene. Benzene is much less reactive than any of these. Any of the alkenes will be readily converted to alcohols in the presence of a dilute aqueous solution of H 2 SO 4, but benzene is inert.
