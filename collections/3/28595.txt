Hartlepool, United... Hi just wanting a bit of advice, my mum and I are travelling to NYC on 23rd August - 29th August and just wondering what the temperatures are like and what the humidity is like? We have both been to NYC but I went in October and my mum went in April so neither of us have experienced it in August.
