This sound, which comes from inside the head, typically is described as a ringing, but it also can take the form of an annoying hiss, whistle or buzz. Tinnitus can be constant or can come and go. Occasionally, tinnitus is a side effect of medication. Aspirin in moderate to high doses often causes tinnitus.
