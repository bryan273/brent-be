35.6), the waves spread out from the slits as shown in Figure 37.1b. In other words, the light deviates from a straight-line path and enters the region that would other wise be shadowed. As noted in Section 35.3, this divergence of light from its initial line of travel is called diffraction. Inter ference in light waves from two sources was Ãžrst demonstrated by Thomas Young in 1801. A schematic diagram of the apparatus that Young used is shown in Figure 37.2a. Plane light waves arrive at a barrier that contains two parallel slits S1 and S 2.
