U.S. coins can be substituted for a tire tread depth gauge as tires wear to the critical final few 32nds of an inch of their remaining tread depth. Place a penny into several tread grooves across the tire. If part of Lincoln's head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 2/32 of tread depth remaining. Place a quarter into several tread grooves across the tire. If part of Washington's head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 4/32 of tread depth remaining. Place a penny into several tread grooves across the tire. If the top of the Lincoln Memorial is always covered by the tread, you have more than 6/32 of tread depth remaining.
