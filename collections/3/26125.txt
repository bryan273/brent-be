Goldfish live in many different temperatures. Anywhere from 50 degrees F to 68 degrees F is best, provided that any change in temperature is gradual. A rapid temperature change can make a fish more susceptible to disease, as can stress. Care on the keeper's part can reduce both. Different varieties of Goldfish may also live at different temperatures.
