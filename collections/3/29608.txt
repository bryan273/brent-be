As leader of the executive branch, the President is primarily responsible for seeing that the work of government is done. The responsibility to administer and execute the laws of the land squarely rests on the President's shoulders. The president must therefore recruit and appoint many people to top government jobs. Cabinet members, many sub-Cabinet positions, federal judges including Supreme Court Justices, ambassadors, top military leaders, and heads of independent government agencies are all appointments filled by the President.
