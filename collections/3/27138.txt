The uterine mucosa reacts to the implantation by the decidual reaction. The syncytiotrophoblast cells phagocytize the apoptotic decidual cells of the endometrium and resorb the proteins, sugars and lipids that have been formed there. They also erode the canals of the endometrial glands and the capillaries of the stroma.
