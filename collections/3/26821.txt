Indoor Overwintering. Place geraniums on a sunny windowsill and trim them to no taller than 8 inches. Keep your indoor temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and if possible, lower the temperature of your house at night.Water geraniums weekly, with less water than you would use during the spring and summer growing seasons.n USDA zones 9 and below, geraniums will not survive the winter if left outside. To grow perennial geraniums in one of these cooler USDA zones, plant your geraniums in a container that may be moved indoors in mid-to late fall, before the first frost.
