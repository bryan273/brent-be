If a bad oxygen sensor is aligned with the ignition system on a car's engine, it can retard or advance engine ignition timing, which can cause an engine to ping.ough Engine Idle Vehicle engines that have a bad oxygen sensor often run irregularly or roughly. Oxygen sensors can control or contribute to many different engine functions, including fuel/air mixture, engine timing and engine combustion intervals.
