Variety is a quality similar to diversity or difference. Some feel having variety in life is much more exciting than doing the same routine day in and day out. You’ve likely heard the expression “variety is the spice of life” to describe how our days are more interesting when different things happen. Variety can also describe different things that are classified under one category or type, like varieties of apple — granny smith, pink lady, or red delicious.
