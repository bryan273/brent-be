Cleaning Your Tiles After Laying and Grouting. Once your tiles have been laid and grouted, they will need to be cleaned thoroughly to remove all residue cement and grout smears, silicone leaching, and dirt. This cleaning is best done about a week after laying the tiles, as the grout will require 5-7 days to properly dry and age. • A broom. • One scrubbing brush. • One heavy scrubbing brush.
