Here is WHY non-Muslims should care about the introduction of any halal food into the West. I read a great anti-halal essay that explained that halal food contributes to four significant problems – independent of animal cruelty or religious issues.The first problem is an employment fairness issue.alal slaughter requires that Muslims perform all halal rituals. The end result is that Muslims begin to “take over” food production jobs of a nation. The idea that Muslims – who wish to eliminate non-Muslims – control any aspect of non-Muslim food production is disturbing.
