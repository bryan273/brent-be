Lance corporal is an enlisted rank in the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Corps is the only branch of the U.S. armed forces to have the rank of lance corporal. Early Marine Corps rankings included both a lance corporal and a lance sergeant. Although the rank of lance sergeant was eventually removed from the Corps' ranking structure, the rank of lance corporal was established as a permanent rank in 1958.
