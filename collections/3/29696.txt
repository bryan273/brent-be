Women's Clothing. Most Egyptian women keep their shoulders, chest, stomach, and knees covered at all times. In smaller towns, many women wear traditional long, loose-fitting gowns and cover their hair. When women approach a mosque or religious site, they must cover any bare skin and remove their shoes before entering.
