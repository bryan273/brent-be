Hebei (Chinese: 河北; pinyin: Héběi; postal: Hopeh) is a province of China in the North China region. Its one-character abbreviation is 冀 (jì), named after Ji Province, a Han Dynasty province (zhou) that included what is now southern Hebei. The name Hebei literally means north of the river, referring to its location entirely to the north of the Huang He 黄河 (Yellow River).
