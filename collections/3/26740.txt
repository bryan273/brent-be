For a festive, youthful, island look, wear a smaller chain of flowers on your head like a crown. Usually the flower crown fits loosely, and worn properly, goes from the forehead to the nape of the neck. Go for the ear. Tuck a single Hawaiian flower behind the ear for a fresh, romantic adornment. According to Hawaiian traditions, wear a flower behind the left ear, the side closest to your heart, to indicate you are in a relationship. Wear a flower behind the right ear to show that you are single and looking for someone. Afflix the bloom with a hairpin or clip to secure your flirty, natural look. Go for a bracelet. Fit a loose chain of flowers around the wrist, or attach a single bloom to a ring of elastic or a plain bangle for a corsage.
