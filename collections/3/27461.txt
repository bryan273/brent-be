When thinking about how to grow peppers, remember that they prefer higher temperatures, and when you plant peppers, be sure that the chance of frost is long gone. A frost will either kill the plants altogether, or inhibit pepper growth so you have bare plants. Pepper plants should be placed 18 to 24 inches apart in a row. They do well if planted near your tomatoes. The soil should be well drained and fertilized before you put them into the ground. You can fertilize once more after you pick the first crop of peppers, which helps to form another crop.
