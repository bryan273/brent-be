Crimes against humanity. After World War II, the Allies decided to bring to justice those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trials of leading German officials took place between 18 October 1945 and 1 October 1946 in Nuremberg, Germany, before judges representing the Allied powers. These are now known as the Nuremberg Trials.
