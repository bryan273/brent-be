Kefir is a fermented probiotic milk drink. It is made by adding kefir grains to cow’s or goat’s milk. Kefir grains are not cereal grains, but rather cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeast that look a bit like cauliflower. The word kefir allegedly comes from the Turkish word keyif, which means “feeling good” after eating (12). In fact, kefir has been linked to various health benefits.
