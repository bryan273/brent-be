By drinking at mimir's sacred fountain, he became the wisest of gods and men. mimir was a giant in size, but he was not one of the fierce giant enemies of the gods, for he was kind, and wiser than the wisest. No less a person than the Swimmer, Oriander, who is in turn the son of mimir. Under it is the fountain mimir, spring of wisdom, from which Odin drinks daily. Far down in Giant-land, where the roots began to shoot, was an ancient well, guarded by the good giant mimir (Memory).
