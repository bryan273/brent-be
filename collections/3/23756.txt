I’d roll my eyes as Wesley ordered a Jack Daniels Burger from TGI Friday’s every single time we wound up there for dinner (which was at least once a week).But then…. Then one day, when asking my friends for recipe suggestions, my friend Tashima asked me to make Jack Daniels Burgers like the ones from Friday’s.I considered it a courageous challenge for someone who had never eaten a Jack Daniels Burger before.or the Jack Daniels Glaze: 1  In a large saucepan over medium/high heat, combine the water, pineapple juice, Teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. 2  Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine. 3  Let the mixture simmer for about an hour, or until it becomes syrupy and reduces by half.
