A bad O2 sensor will cause the catalytic convertor to fail because the engine ran too rich and dumped too much rich exhaust into the cat-cats are very expensive, I just had a new one installed, sounded like it had rocks in it. And of course that assisted in the murder of the muffler.ad O2 sensor or O2 sensor not working properly O2 sensor senses the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust gases and send signal to ECU to regulate Air fuel ratio. If O2 sens â€¦ or is bad or not working then it does not work effectively so air fuel ratio is not maintained.
