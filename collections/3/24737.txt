This constant, K b, is called the base ionization constant. It can be determined by experiment and each base has its own unique value. For example, ammonia's value is 1.77 x 10¯ 5. From the chemical equation above, it can be seen that NH 4 + and OH¯ concentrations are in the molar ratio of one-to-one.
