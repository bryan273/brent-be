You may think of pollution and contamination as being the same thing. Perhaps in a general term, they are. But when it comes to specifically talking about your water, the two, and their causes are very different.Pollution is due to the influence or activities of people, where contamination may be natural.n example of a point source of water pollution is a pipe from an industrial facility discharging effluent directly into a river. An example of a nonpoint-source of water pollution is when fertilizer from a farm field is carried into a stream by rain (i.e. run-off).
