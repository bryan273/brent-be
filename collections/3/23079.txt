Cape Verde. The Cape Verde islands consist of two small (volcanic in origin) archipelagos, about 400 miles off the western coast of Africa. These once uninhabited islands were first discovered by the ancient Phoenicians, then later colonized and exploited by the Portuguese, beginning in the 15th century.
