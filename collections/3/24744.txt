The following equation describes the reaction between ammonia and water: NH 3 + H 2 O ==> NH 4 + + OH¯ Note that it is an equilibrium condition. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is written as follows: K c = ( [NH 4 +] [OH¯] ) / ( [NH 3] [H 2 O] ) However, in pure liquid water, [H 2 O] is a constant value. To demonstrate this, consider 1000 mL of water with a density of 1.00 g/mL. This 1.00 liter (1000 mL) would weigh 1000 grams. This mass divided by the molecular weight of water (18.0152 g/mol) gives 55.5 moles. The molarity of this water would then be 55.5 mol / 1.00 liter or 55.5 M.
