Cigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for development of lung cancer. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body.
