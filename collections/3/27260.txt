Can a exhaust leak cause your engine to loose power? I had a leak where the cat meets the B pipe, so I re welded those two pieces.f the leak is close to one of the o2 sensors, then air entering the exhaust during reversion is sensed by the o2 sensor and the ecu thinks the engine is running lean, causing it to richen the afr with a subsequent loss of power. A leak far enough back won't adversely affect performance.
