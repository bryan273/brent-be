Primary glaucoma is inherited. The condition is very rare in cats, but it occurs in many breeds of dogs, including the cocker spaniel, basset hound, chow, Jack Russell, Shih tzu, and the Siberian husky. Primary glaucoma typically starts in one eye, but in most cases it will eventually involve both eyes.
