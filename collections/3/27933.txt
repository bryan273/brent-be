This kind of lighting is popular due to the fact that the fixtures are recessed, or installed into the ceiling and not surface mounted, leaving you with a clean and sharp light without seeing the entire fixture. You can install recessed lights in all rooms of your home, giving the exact lighting you need for any given space.
