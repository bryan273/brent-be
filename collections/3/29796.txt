This energy gets trapped in the ATP as it converts from ADP to ATP by the addition of phosphate. There are 3 main pathways for harvesting energy from glucose: Glycolysis - begins glucose metabolism in all cells to produce 2 molecules of pyruvate. Occurs outside of mitochondria, usually in cytoplasm. Cellular Respiration - uses oxygen from the environment and converts each pyruvate to three molecules of carbon dioxide while trapping the energy released in this process in ATP.
