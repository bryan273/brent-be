Before you decide to sign up for Medicare or stay on an employer’s health plan, compare all the costs. Your employer’s coverage may be less expensive. You don’t pay a premium for Medicare Part A, which covers hospitalization. But for Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient care, most people pay $104.90 per month.
