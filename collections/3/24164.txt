Answers (1) The half life of Seroquel is around 6 hours. This means that every 6 hours, half of the previous amount of Seroquel in the body disappears. For example, if you took 10mg of Seroquel at 12AM (midnight), at 6AM 5mg of Seroquel will be left in your body. At 12PM (noon), 2.5mg will be left, and so forth until there is 0mg left in your body.
