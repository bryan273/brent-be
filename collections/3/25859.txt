Nails that chip, peel, crack, or break easily show a nutritional deficiency and insufficient hydrochloric acid and protein. Minerals are also needed. Brittle, soft, shiny nails without a moon may indicate an overactive thyroid. White lines across the nail may indicate a liver disease. White lines horizontally show possible heart disease, high fever, or arsenic poisoning. Nails separated from the nail bed may signify a thyroid disorder. Nails raised at the base (clubbing) with small white ends show a respiratory disorder such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis.
