Every business involves the use of some sort of equipment which employees need to do their job, and this equipment is generally provided by the business. While some personal use of business equipment is realistically to be expected, problems can arise when the personal use is excessive. Problems that can arise in the personal use of equipment that belongs to the business, such as computers, tools, or vehicles, include: 1  broken equipment, which may cause disputes over who is responsible for repair. 2  lost productivity, as employees use work time for personal tasks involving business equipment.
