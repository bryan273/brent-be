Scout Overlook (view N to Angels Landing summit) Past the knob, the trail runs over a saddle (Wpt. 8) on the ridge where the trail is only about 2 feet wide, 1,200 feet down to the Virgin River on one side, and 800 feet down to the bottom of the canyon on the other side. There is a chain, but it is pretty airy.
