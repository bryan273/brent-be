Los Angeles County has a higher sales tax because of voter-approved taxes in 1980, 1990 and 2008 to fund the public transportation system. As a result, the Los Angeles County minimum sales tax is 9%, but a few cities have pegged on additional taxes, such as Santa Monica, Culver City and City of Commerce, which come in at 9.5%.
