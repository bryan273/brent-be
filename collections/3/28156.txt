Road rage completely, I don't know what was wrong with the guy, he lost his mind I don't even know, he said. Miami-Dade Police said Perez was shot twice with a shotgun and airlifted to Jackson South Trauma Center. He underwent surgery and has been released from the hospital. The movers are still in shock over the sudden road rage violence.
