Absorbed dose - The fundamental quantity for describing the effects of radiation in a tissue or organ is the absorbed dose. Absorbed dose is the energy deposited in a small volume of matter (tissue) by the radiation beam passing through the matter divided by the mass of the matter. Absorbed dose is thus measured in terms of energy deposited per unit mass of material. Absorbed dose is measured in joules/kilogram, and a quantity of 1 joule/kilogram has the special unit of gray (Gy) in the International System of quantities and units. (In terms of the older system of radiation quantities and units previously used, 1 Gy equals 100 rad, or 1mGy equals 0.1 rad.)
