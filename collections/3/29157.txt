Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek δενδρίτης, dendrites, of or pertaining to a tree) are the most common form of drainage system. In a dendritic system, there are many contributing streams (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which are then joined together into the tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively).
