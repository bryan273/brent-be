Propane tanks for the home can be installed either above or below ground. Propane tanks are available in a range of sizes to accommodate your needs. Common sizes for above ground tanks are 120, 250, 500, or 1,000 gallon, while underground tanks are usually either 500 or 1,000 gallons. The size of the tank needed depends on how much propane will be used, which varies by size of the home, climate, and the number of appliances powered by propane.
