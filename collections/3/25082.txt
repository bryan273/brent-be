For checks made payable to Two Payees, both parties have to endorse the check if there is an “and” (i.e. John and Mary Public). If there is an “or” between the names, then only one signature is required (either John’s or Mary’s).Travelers checks must be signed and countersigned on the signature line before deposit.
