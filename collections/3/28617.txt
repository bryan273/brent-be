Try the Talk Test â€” it's one of the best ways to measure your workout's intensity, according to a new study. The Talk Test measures how easy or hard it is for you to hold a conversation while exercising to gauge how intense your workout really is (similar to the Rate of Perceived Exertion scale). To test its usefulness, researchers studied healthy adults by making them recite the Pledge of Allegiance while exercising at varying intensities.
