One of the 2—right and left—organs of respiration located in the thoracic cavity on either side of the mediastinum, and protected laterally by the ribs, anteriorly by the sternum and posteriorly by the vertebral column. The lungs are the site of respiration/gas exchange, allowing O2 in, and expelling CO2.
