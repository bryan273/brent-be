How To Make Money In Any Market And 5 Stocks To Buy Right Now. Thomas H. Forester, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, Forester Capital Management. Tom Forester: We are a large cap value fund using a low price/earnings ratio and a bottom-up stock picking approach. One thing that’s a bit unique about what we do though is that we can also hedge downside risk if we feel that there’s vulnerability in the market using both cash and puts. We have done that over time. I think we were one of the few funds that made money in 2008 and in 2002 as well. We haven’t had many down years. We try to make money in all markets. That’s our approach. Wally Forbes: Sounds like you’ve avoided some of the trip ups that many of us have had in the past. Forester: In order to beat the market you don’t have to make as much on the upside if you don’t lose it all on the downside.
