This is the time in life, usually when a woman is in her late forties to early sixties, when the release of eggs by the ovaries begins to slow down, and eventually end completely. Perimenopause is the time before the onset of menopause. This is the gradual end of ovulation that can actually take many months or years. At this time, the chance of pregnancy during menopause is much more likely. This is a very slow process that will still allow ovulation to take place, making it possible for an individual to still become pregnant during menopause.
