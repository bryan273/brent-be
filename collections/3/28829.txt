If you are new to kombucha, you may want to start by drinking 1-2 or 4 fluid oz daily/at a time to let your body adjust to it. You may work your way up to 4 or 8 oz a day, but it's been recommended that you stop at the abosolute max of 32 oz./day!- there is such a thing as too much kombucha! For me, 4 oz. a day (such as 2 oz. in the morning and 2 oz. at night) is plenty. Happy Herbalist does not recommended kombucha for pregnant or nursing women, or children under the age of 4. Meanwhile, others suggest that kombucha is ok for pregnant women, and that kombucha can be safe for young children.
