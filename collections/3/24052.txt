Prostacyclin is produced in endothelial cells from prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. Although prostacyclin is considered an independent mediator, it is called PGI 2 (prostaglandin I 2) in eicosanoid nomenclature, and is a member of the prostanoids (together with the prostaglandins and thromboxane). The series-3 prostaglandin PGH 3 also follows the prostacyclin synthase pathway, yielding another prostacyclin, PGI 3. [3]
