By: Stephen Douglas | April 1, 2014 1:45 pm ET. Julius Peppers is dating a model named Claudia Sampedro. Peppers, who signed a 3-year deal with the Green Bay Packers last month, showed up on Sampedro’s highly-trafficked Instagram account (510K followers) in a picture from their vacation in Mexico. According to Sampedro’s Facebook page, in addition to being a glamour model, she also works as an actress, musician and supermodel. Peppers has presumably been preparing for a relationship with a woman as multi-talented as Sampedro since he appeared in a Nelly video 12 years ago. Sampedro also dated Reggie Bush a few years ago.
