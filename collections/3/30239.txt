1 Inexpensive, easy to adjust rope length, for all ages and ability levels. 2  Best all-purpose rope for instructors who work with several groups of varying ages (to quickly shorten a rope, just tie a knot or two in the cord below the handle and begin to jump).  Lightweight and easy to turn at high speed.
