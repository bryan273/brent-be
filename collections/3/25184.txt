Sometimes the body releases too much histamine. The result is mosquito bite swelling, or what's called a “wheal.” The area around the bite rises, turns red and begins to itch. How much and for how long varies from person to person, but swollen mosquito bites generally are about the size of a dime and last about a day. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic report that, in some people with extreme sensitivities, mosquito bites can swell to the size of grapefruits and linger for days.
