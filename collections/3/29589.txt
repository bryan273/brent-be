Brothers Johnson â€“ Stomp! lyrics. Steppin' out the weekends open wide. Fill it up let's blast the jams and ride. While we're cruisin' around in the street. Listen up for the party in feet. Slap me five that's the place we've arrived it's alive. Everybody take it to the top. We're gonna stomp all night in the neighborhood.
