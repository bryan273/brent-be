Attach a flag pole mount to your front porch, wooden fence or any other vertical surface. Choose the flag pole holder that fits your needs by choosing between our many pole angle options. Flag mounts are available in 90, 80, 45, 60, and 30 degree angles. Also choose a material for your flag pole holder. Aluminum is a durable outdoor flag mount material that doesn't rust or rot and is lightweight. A cast-iron flag pole holder is heavier and is available in black, white or bronze.
