Gas leads to uncomfortable tightness in the abdominal region, and this pain can be eased by treating it with heat. 1  Fill a hot water bottle, lie down on your bed or on the couch, and place the bottle over your stomach. The heat will help relieve the tightness.  A hot bath also helps ease the pain of gas and constipation.
