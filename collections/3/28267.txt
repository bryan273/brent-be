Trust thy self, and another shall not betray thee. Poor Richard's Almanack (sometimes Almanac) was published by Benjamin Franklin, who adopted the pseudonym of Poor Richard or Richard Saunders for this purpose. Franklin began publishing Poor Richard's Almanack on December 19, 1732; annual versions were published for each year from 1733 to 1758. It was a best seller for a pamphlet published in the American colonies; print runs reached 10,000 per year.
