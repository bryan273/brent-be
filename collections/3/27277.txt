Percentage of Landmass. Most of the world's surface is covered in water, in the form of oceans. The remaining landmass of Earth amounts to approximately 29 percent of the surface. Of this remaining 29 percent, deserts of all types constitute an estimated 33 percent, or one-third, of the Earth's total landmass. This large percentage is due in part to the vastness of the world's largest desert -- Antarctica.
