As you can see, the A4 paper size is essentially between the U.S. Letter and Legal size at 8.3 x 8. 11.7 in. One perk of all the sizes based on the A0 paper size is that all sheets can be scaled in relation to one another. For instance, an A4 size can be folded into an A5 paper size brochure. Similarly, an A3 paper size can be folded down exactly into an A4.
