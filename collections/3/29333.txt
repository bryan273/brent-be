The Cost Factor. Get ready to cough it up. The College Board reports that the average cost of one year of in-state tuition and fees at a public four-year school is $8,655. Tack on another $9,205 in room and board costs and youâ€™re looking at an average yearly bill of $17,860.For private school students, the situation is even worse.wo-year students get a huge break on tuition as well. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees at a two-year school is only $3,131, just over one-third of the cost for a year at a four-year public institution.
