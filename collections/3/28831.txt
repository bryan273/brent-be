Beer Trader. Drinking more beer than your liver can process. It takes one hour for your liver to process one drink. So anytime you get a hangover, I would classify that as unhealthy. So ALWAYS drink water during a night of drinking beer. #7 Oct 15, 2013. microbrewlover, Jsteez, luwak and 1 other person like this.
