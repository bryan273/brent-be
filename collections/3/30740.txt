You are following a track that wants perfection. It's going to cost and more likely to cost twice your/contractor's estimate. Start with $50,000 you were told and add 10%(conservative) for problems, 10% for cost of living somewhere else during work, 10% to fix the house after the work, and 10% for the rainy day.
