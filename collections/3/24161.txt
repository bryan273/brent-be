Most sources suggest that the immediate-release and extended release (XR) version of quetiapine have an elimination half-life of approximately 7 hours. This indicates that it takes an average of 7 hours post-ingestion for 50% of the quetiapine dosage to get eliminated from systemic circulation. Based off of this information, it is possible to predict that Seroquel stays in your system for around 1.6 days after your last dose. In other words, it will likely take over 24 hours, but less than 48 hours for your system to have fully cleared itself of the drug.
