If you take the time to ask your provider before you travel, there will be additional charges to use mobile internet abroad on roaming, which are typically not included in your package. The good news is that using roaming you can carry on using WhatsApp regardless of where you are. On a negative note, all the messaging you could do for free now needs to be paid, as you're using the mobile network of a carrier that you're not subscribed to.
