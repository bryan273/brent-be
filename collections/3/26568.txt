Kansas /ˈkænzəs/ is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean people of the wind or people of the south wind, although this was probably not the term's original meaning.
