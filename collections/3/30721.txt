The other large cities of the Pacific Northwest do not come close to Metro Vancouver for the proportion of people with backgrounds in Asia. In Victoria, just 11 per cent of the population has Asian heritage. In Seattle, the proportion is 13 per cent and in Portland itâ€™s eight per cent. An analysis of Statistics Canada reports show the percentage of those with Asian heritages will continue to grow rapidly across Metro Vancouver, a region that has doubled in population in just 30 years.
