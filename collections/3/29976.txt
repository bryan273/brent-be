Purcell Mountains. Beginning in northwest Montana, the Purcell Mountains rise and march northward into British Columbia, where they become a spectacular, forest and glacier-clad uplift, a part of what are generically called the Columbia Mountains.opyright Ralph Maughan. The Purcells are separated from the Rockies by the Rocky Mountain Trench, an amazing valley that is about 600 miles long, but only one to five miles wide. British Columbia has protected one large roadless portion in the middle of the Purcells as the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Park.
