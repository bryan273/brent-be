Basically green tea is the least processed of four different types of tea; green, oolong, black and white, all of which come for the Camellia sinensis bush. Unlike the other tea variants, green tea leaves are steamed. Processing them in this way preserves the compound epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is a powerful antioxidant that gives green tea many of its health properties.
