Bring your potted geraniums back indoors in the fall when frost is once again an issue. Acclimate them to the indoors like you did the outdoors. You can grow them as houseplants in a sunny area of your home. Don’t forget to keep the soil slightly moist and keep plants away from heat sources and drafts.Note that garden geraniums will die back like annuals if they are not hardy in your climate.cclimate them to the indoors like you did the outdoors.
