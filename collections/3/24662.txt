Some protists, such as Paramecium (Fig. 21.2a), swim actively with beating hairs called cilia and hunt for food in their environment. Other protists, such as various groups of amoebas, crawl along slowly and engulf whatever food they come across. Still other protists, such as the foraminiferans, are covered by a shell and often remain stationary.
