Jokers as Wild Cards in Poker. The most common meaning of joker is a wild card in poker. There are often two extra joker cards included in a deck of cards. These cards have no suit, and they traditionally feature a character dressed as a court jester or clown. When a player draws a wild card, they can designate it to stand for any card of their choice.
