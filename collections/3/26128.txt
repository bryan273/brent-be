As water temperature moves from the 50s to the 70s, the speed of digestion increases, the rate of oxygen consumption goes up, and the immune response quickens. Goldfish in aquariums kept at 75 degrees will probably eat five to 10 times more fish food per month than goldfish kept at 58 degrees. Second, temperature directly affects other physical and chemical properties of water, which in turn affect the fish. Warmer waters hold lower concentrations of oxygen.
