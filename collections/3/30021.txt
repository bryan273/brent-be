Something I just thought of and maybe it has nothing to do with it but could the device itself be defaulting to the ASUS for some reason? I can open the ASUS and scan no problem, the HP not at all. I don't want to mess with the ASUS though because I need the scanning feature and if it is working there it needs to continue working!
