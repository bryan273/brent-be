How often to change your air filters can depend on the following: the type of air filter you are using; the overall indoor air quality; how many pets are in the home; the number of people occupying the home, and; the level of air pollution and construction around the home For basic 1-3 air filters, manufacturers usually direct you to change them every 30-60 days. If you suffer from light to moderate allergies, you could upgrade the air filter or change them [even more often|more frequently|every few weeks]3].
