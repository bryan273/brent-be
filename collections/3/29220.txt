Share to: The canyons in Badlands National Park in South Dakota were formed  by the depostion of layers composed of tiny grains of sediments  such as sand, silt, and clay, and then by â€¦ erosion when the Cheyenne  River captured streams and rivers flowing from the Black Hills into  the Badlands region. In the United States, National Parks are areas designated by the federal government and managed by the National Park Service (NPS).
