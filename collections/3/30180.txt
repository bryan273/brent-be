While that's annoying I'm one of those people that does not pick up the phone if I don't know the number so it wasn't a huge issue. Until today, when I was waiting to get a call back from the hospital on an update on a family member. When Quicken Loans called me I picked up on the off chance that it was the hospital calling with an update.
