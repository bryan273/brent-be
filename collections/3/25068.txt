Facilitated diffusion, on the other hand, utilizes a protein within the cell membrane to carry molecules into the cell. Glucose is one type of molecule that requires a membrane protein to pass through the cell membrane.This process is still considered passive because it doesn’t really require a true energy output, but the protein molecule acts as sort of a check so that transport isn’t as free as it is in simple diffusion.ransport that is “active” is different in that it requires the energy of certain membrane proteins to get across the concentration gradient and either into or out of the cell.
