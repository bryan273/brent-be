High blood cholesterol signals a higher risk. of heart attack and stroke. That’s why it’s. important to have your cholesterol levels. checked regularly and discuss them with. your doctor. A “lipoprotein profile” is a test to. find out your blood cholesterol numbers. It gives information about total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol and HDL (good) cholesterol, as well as triglycerides (blood fats). What Do My Cholesterol Levels Mean? Total Blood Cholesterol Levels: Less than 200 mg/dL = Desirable (lower risk) 200 to 239 mg/dL = Borderline high (higher risk) 240 mg/dL and above = High blood cholesterol (more than twice the risk as desirable level) What should my total cholesterol level be? HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. HDL is “good” cholesterol because it seems to lower your risk of heart attack and stroke. That means that — unlike other cholesterol levels — the higher your HDL, the better. You can raise your HDL by quitting smoking, losing excess weight and being more active. HDL Cholesterol Levels: Less than 40 mg/dL = Low HDL (higher risk) 40 to 59 mg/dL = The higher, the better 60 mg/dL and above = High HDL (lower risk) LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. This is the main carrier of harmful cholesterol in your blood. A high level of LDL cholesterol means there’s a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. LDL Cholesterol Levels: Less than 100 mg/dL = Optimal for people with heart disease or diabetes 100 to 129 mg/dL = Near or above optimal 130 to 159 mg/dL = Borderline high 160 to 189 mg/dL = High 190 mg/dL and above = Very High What should my HDL and LDL cholesterol levels be?
