This new continuing education requirement is part of the IRSâ€™s efforts to eliminate problems it has experienced with unqualified preparers. The 15 hours of continuing education must include 10 hours of federal tax law, three hours of federal tax law updates, and two hours of ethics. Preparers must provide their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) to continuing education providers so their continuing education can be reported to the IRS.
