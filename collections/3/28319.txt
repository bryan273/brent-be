Benefits are generally paid on the second Wednesday if the NH was born within the first 10 days of a month, the third Wednesday if born within the 11-20th days and on the fourth Wednesday if born within the 21-31st days. Until 1997, all routine Social Security payments arrived on the third of a month. Unlike now, electronic banking was less popular. Check day, actually that entire week, was always hectic. People who needed to contact a SSA office found it difficult to do so.
