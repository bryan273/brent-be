Rubato is a technique typically used during Romantic period music, such as Chopin, Schumann, and other composers. It is not something used as much during baroque or classical era music: Bach, Mozart, Haydn, and others. Simply put, Rubato is a give and take in the timing of music â€“ it adds an expressive element.
