The exhibition and its accompanying catalogue studied the influence of the Bluestocking Circle, with particular focus on the group around Elizabeth Montague in the 1770s; traced the development of the work, social organization and public reception of the Circle through the 1780s; outlined the political reaction and its effect on the Circle in the 1790s; and finally examined the legacy of the Bluestockings in the early nineteenth century, with some comments on the twentieth.
