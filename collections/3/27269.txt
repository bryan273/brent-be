How much of the Earth is water? The oceans cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface and contain 97 percent of the Earth's water. Less than 1 percent of the Earth's water is fresh water, and 2-3 percent is contained in glaciers and ice caps. The oceans contain 99 percent of the living space on the planet. If the ocean's total salt content were dried, it would cover the continents to a depth of 5 feet.
