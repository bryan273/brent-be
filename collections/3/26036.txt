I had the pleasure of seeing the Drowsy Chaperone in Los Angeles before it headed to Broadway and then once again upon its return. It is one of my favorite original musicals containing all of the fun of 42nd Street in a new story about The Man in the Chair with an acerbic view of musicals in the modern day compared to the silliness found in the old 20's and 30's musicals.
