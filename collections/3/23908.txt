Objectives, Goals and Outcomes. Every program should know where it is coming from (goals and objectives) and what it is trying to accomplish (outcomes). Without the direction of goals and objectives there can be no outcomes because outcomes are specific and measurable aspects of your organization’s goals and objectives. All of these measurable items should be determined during your organization’s planning process.
