The Curse of Oak Island. Off the coast of Nova Scotia sits a small island that is a riddle wrapped in enigma. In the 1700s, people noticed strange lights there at night, and the person sent to investigate them disappeared. Eventually, a couple of kids who rowed out to the island found a strange indentation in the ground. This discovery began a quest that goes on until this day, and has involved everyone from FDR to John Wayne.
