Dendritic drainage In geomorphology , drainage systems , also known as river systems , are the patterns formed by the streams , rivers , and lakes in a particular drainage basin . They are governed by the topography of the land, whether a particular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks, and the gradient of the land.
