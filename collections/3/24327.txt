Certification as a medical coding specialist is voluntary, but well worth pursuing. Candidates with AHIMA or AAPC credentials are strongly preferred by employers, and often earn more than non-certified peers. In fact, AAPC estimates that coders holding a Certified Professional Coder (CPC) credential earn 20% more. In addition to its entry-level CPC credential, AAPC offers certifications that demonstrate coding and/or health care business expertise in various settings and medical specialties.
