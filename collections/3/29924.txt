How Earthquakes Happen. An aerial view of the San Andreas fault in the Carrizo Plain, Central California. An earthquake is the vibration, sometimes violent, of the Earth's surface that follows a release of energy in the Earth's crust.This energy can be generated by a sudden dislocation of segments of the crust, by a volcanic eruption, or event by manmade explosions.eologists have found that earthquakes tend to reoccur along faults, which reflect zones of weakness in the Earth's crust. Even if a fault zone has recently experienced an earthquake, however, there is no guarantee that all the stress has been relieved. Another earthquake could still occur.
