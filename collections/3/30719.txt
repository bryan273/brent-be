North Nanaimo and Nearby Parks. North Nanaimo is perhaps best known for the shopping malls strung along the Island Highway (#19A) â€“ notably the Woodgrove Shopping Centre, the largest such megamall on Vancouver Island. What many visitors miss is the northside's lovely waterfront parkland accessible from Hammond Bay Road.
