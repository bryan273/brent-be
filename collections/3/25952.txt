In northern Canada, much of the hard rock found is igneous rock. Igneous rock is rock formed by the hardening and crystallization of molten material that originates deep within the earth. The word igneous comes from the Greek word for fire; some people call igneous rock a fire ball rock. Rocks that have hardened from magma, the hot liquid beneath the earth's crust, are called igneous rocks. The inside of the earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. The deeper you get the hotter it gets. Below the surface, the molten rock is called magma; at the earth's surface it becomes lava, nothing has changed only the name of the liquid. Igneous rock is made by fire. Small wonder the magma from which igneous rock is formed can reach temperatures close to 1200 degrees Celsius.
