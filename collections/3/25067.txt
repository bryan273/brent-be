FACILITATED DIFFUSION. In facilitated diffusion, substances move into or out of cells down their concentration gradient through protein channels in the cell membrane. Simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion are similar in that both involve movement down the concentration gradient.ecall that membranes have two major components: phospholipids arranged in a bilayer, and membrane proteins.
