For some it’s a great romantic movie, for others it is a very cheesy chick flick. But should you decide to visit Wicklow for instance, it is very likely your guides will mention this very popular movie as you pass by the movie’s main shooting locations. I love this movie. And to tell you the truth I came to work in Ireland FOR this movie.
