Anatomy. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) is a one of the four major ligaments in the knee. The LCL is on the outside of the knee connecting the thighbone (femur) to the smaller bone in the lower leg (fibular). Its main function is to avoid varus stress across the knee (where the knee buckles outwards).
