Although many people refer to the rotator cuff as a general area in the shoulder, your rotator cuff itself is a group of 4 tendons located at the top of your humerus. These tendons are called the subscapularis tendon, the supraspinatus tendon, the infraspinatus tendon, and the teres minor tendon.These tendons come together to surround the front, back, and the top of the shoulder socket acting as a 'cuff' to connect your humerus to the rotator cuff muscles.he rotator cuff is a shallow 'ball-and-socket' joint where the humerus (upper arm) meets the scapula (shoulder blade). 2-5% of the population will experience Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder), most for no apparent reason.
