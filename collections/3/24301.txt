Step 2. Place the tip of your chisel near the center of the tile and give it a light tap. Start gently and add force gradually. As bits of tile begin to break free from the center, find a spot where you can wedge the chisel between the tile and the wall.With moderate taps, loosen broken pieces of tile from the center.tep 7. Use a premixed grout/adhesive or mix grout to the consistency of peanut butter and use the tip of a plastic putty knife to press it into the grooves surrounding the tile. Also, fill any grout areas damaged during removal of the tile.
