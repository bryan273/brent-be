Unlike federal income taxes, no pre-registration is required for businesses to pay state income taxes. Sole proprietors file and pay income tax using their social security number. Partnerships file and pay income tax using their federal identification number. Corporations file and pay income tax using their federal identification number. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) are taxed either as a partnership or a corporation, depending upon whether the members elected to be taxed as a corporation.
