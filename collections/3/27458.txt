Most varieties of hot pepper seeds take about 2 weeks to germinate. Hot peppers flourish when temperatures are 85° F during the day and 70° F at night. Hot peppers should not be left to mature in temperatures that exceed 90° F or they may not set fruit. Hot pepper seedlings must be introduced to the outdoors gradually.
