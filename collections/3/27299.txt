Temporary symbols assigned to newly or not-yet synthesized elements use 3-letter symbols based on their atomic numbers. For example, Uno was the temporary symbol for hassium which had the temporary name of unniloctium and Uuo is the symbol for ununoctium (temporary name) with the atomic mass 118. Chemical symbols may be modified by the use of prepended superscripts or subscripts to specify a particular isotope of an atom.
