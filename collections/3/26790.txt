I just bought one of these drivers. G20 tour stiff shaft 8.5 loft. I had been using the G2 Aldila 6.5 shaft with 8.5 loft, and I know I hit the G2 10 to 20 yards further.The ball just dosen’t jump off the face of the G20 club.I’m naturally disapointed.he G20 may not be the perfect panacea for helping you with your driving problems but it sure will try to as long as you give it something to work with. Overall. The PING G20 driver is a contender for a full time spot in my bag.
