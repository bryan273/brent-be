Brittle nails: Everyone has brittle nails to some extent, some more than others. Aging can cause slowed nail growth and dull, brittle, or yellowish nails as the flow of moisture and natural oils to the nail bed declines. A lack of moisture or too much moisture can worsen an already brittle condition.
