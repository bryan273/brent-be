To answer your storage questions: You can pump directly into refrigerated milk as long as you add the milk within 24 hours of when the original milk was expressed. If milk has been stored at room temperature, you can pump directly into it as long as you do it within 8-10hours. You then need to use the milk as soon as possible. Fresh milk can be kept in the refrigerator for up to eight days. If you plan to use the milk within eight days, donâ€™t freeze it.
