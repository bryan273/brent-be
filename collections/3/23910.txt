An objective, on the other hand, is a very direct thing that can be achieved, and which can be measured. An objective might be to memorize the periodic table of elements by the exam next week. This gives you a definite time frame and a specific thing that has to be accomplished, and it gives you a fairly simple idea of how it has to be done.
