Mycoprotein is the ingredient common to all Quorn™ products. It’s a completely meat-free form of high quality protein and is also a good source of dietary fibre. It is low in fat and saturates and contains no cholesterol or trans fats at all. Mycoprotein is made in fermenters similar to those found in a brewery.
