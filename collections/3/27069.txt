Now you can probably find big differences between these opiates and others such as fentanyl, methadone, and suboxone. Oxycodone stays in your system longer - however it has the same 'effect' duration as Hydrocodone. I've always found Oxy to be stronger, but a bit more of a 'rough' (lack of a better description) high. Hydro took more pills, but the high was more euphoric for me -- peaceful but excited and full of energy - and can't stop talking.
