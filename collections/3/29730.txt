Tony produces some of the finest smoked atlantic salmon in the country....our meat is supplied by darren and the crew at snug butchery and our monstrous chicken parmas are made from nichols tasmanian free-range chickens and topped with bruny island cheese.here is no public transport to or on Bruny Island, so you will need to bring your own car or hire a car. Europcar, Hertz, Thrifty, Budget and Avis all hire cars in Tasmania and this can be arranged from all of the major cities and airports.
