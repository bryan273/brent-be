It is a photographer's dream. Antelope Canyon is located a few miles of east of Page, Arizona. Actually there are two antelope Canyon's located on either side of route 98. Upper Antelope Canyon and Lower Antelope Canyon are both owned by the Navajo Nation. Unfortunately, they charge separate entry fees of about $18 per person for each part of this attraction.
