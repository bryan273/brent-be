Size: 102 Each Verified Purchase. The Fastclix is a big improvement over the SoftClix. I always had a hard time removing the lancets from the clicker and disposing of them. I prefer the FastClix to the Multiclix for rotating to the next lancet. Although, I miss the side click button on the FastClix, I'm getting used to snapping from the top button. If you haven't used the drum lancets and are wondering if you can use a lancet more than one time, the answer is Yes--you can.
