Barley crops that are harvested for silage at the soft-dough stage will yield about 20 tonnes/hectare wet forage (63% moisture) or about 7.3 tonnes/hectare dry matter (9 tons/acre wet, and 3.25 tons/acre dry). Extremely heavy crops grown on well-managed irrigated land will yield considerably more forage.
