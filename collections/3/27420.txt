Nobody jumps into the water heater tank. What the temp is in the tank is much hotter than what you use at the tap. If a child gets into a bath that is too hot, then the parent screwed up by not supervising when the tub was filled. water heater should not be set beyond 125 degrees Fahrenheit. As temperatures over 125 degree fahrenheit can burn both children and adults quickly and severely, boilers must be locked at lower settings.
