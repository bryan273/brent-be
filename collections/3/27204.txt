Bamboo Charcoal being used in fabric is a relatively new concept, but people are catching on to this discovery and it has become a popular and eco friendly choice for linens and towels. Bamboo charcoal is made by heating bamboo fibres at high temperatures of 800-1000 degrees celsius. Once the bamboo has been turned into charcoal it is processed into nanoparticles. Then the nanoparticles can be blended with other fibers to create a textile with unique proprieties. In most cases, it is blended with polyester.
