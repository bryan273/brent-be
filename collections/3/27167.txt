Lose a lot of fluid to sweat, and the volume of water available to the blood goes down. Lose 5% of your body mass in water through sweat with no other compensation, and you could lose 25% of your blood volume. Yes, that's kind of like losing 3 pints of blood. The term for extremes of this condition is called hypovolemia. http://en.wikipedia.org/w iki/Deh...
