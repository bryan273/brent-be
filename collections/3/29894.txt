Tlemcen’s Grand Mosque is said to be one of North Africa’s most important Islamic buildings. Begun by the Almoravids – see Morocco History & Politics – in the 11th century (though added to over the many centuries), the mosque symbolises how strong and economically vital this region was during Moorish times.
