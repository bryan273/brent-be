You do need to know about this threat to your engine. The exhaust manifold obviously carries exhaust away from the engine compartment. When the manifold fails to completely perform that function, fumes can enter the coach.This was not detected however in my coach so that telltale signal was missing. The manifold if leaking can reportedly injure the engine.And exhaust gases are used by the turbo system. If that is not performed well, you will notice a loss of boost (power) and mpg. If left unattended (repaired) the leak can also leak hot gasses into equipment and areas where it does not belong.ou do need to know about this threat to your engine.
