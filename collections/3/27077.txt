Posts. 1. oxycodone >> hydrocodone ok oxycodone is stronger its like 5mg of oxycodone is = to 7.5 of hydrocodone they have the about the same effects. but i would say if you have a stronge stomuck oxycodone would be better but if you are a light weight person and a weak stomuck hydrocodone will be better.
