Driving a commercial motor vehicle is a big responsibility. It requires special skills and knowledge. Most drivers must obtain a commercial driver's license (CDL) through their home State (it is illegal to have a license from more than one State). Contact your State licensing bureau (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles) for details.
