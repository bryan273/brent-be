• If you have an old house trap in your basement the trap may be cracked or broken. allowing smells to seep through the cracks and into your home. • If the smell is noticeable mainly around a sink, try flushing a strong cleaner and. bleach down the sink's overflow-the small hole(s) inside the bowl near the rim.
