Place the ribs in the smoker and let it go. A good smoking temperature in the area of 225 degrees F/110 degrees C. You can go lower if you plan on doing a long smoke, but I don't recommend going higher. At this rate, the ribs should be cooked through and tender after 4 hours. Go longer if you can. The longer you smoke at a low temperature the more tender and flavorful the ribs will be. Remember that you need to hit an internal temperature of 165 degrees F/75 degrees C before they can be served.
