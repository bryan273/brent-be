Bind Over Law and Legal Definition The term “bind over” refers to hold a person for trial on bond (bail) or in jail. If the judicial official who conducts a hearing finds probable cause to believe that the accused committed a crime, then the official will bind over the accused, normally by setting bail for the appearance of the accused at trial.
