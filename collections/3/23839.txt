The Blood Cell. Feeding blood and short-tailed pythons can be one of the more interesting aspects of caring for them. Normally they are eager feeders with great appetites and strong feeding responses. They're not finicky as ball pythons often are, nor do they eat big prey items like adult reticulated pythons do. They get great gas mileage out of their food, and don't need frequent feedings or extra large meals in order to maintain healthy weight.
