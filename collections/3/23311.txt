Check for other injuries. Biting your tongue can often be the result of a sports injury or a falling accident. Feel the rest of your mouth to check for damaged or loose teeth, or bleeding gums which can be caused by a tooth fracture. Move your jaw up and down to see if you experience any additional pain.
