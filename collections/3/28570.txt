Silly Of me to think that I could ever have you for my guy How I love you... How I want you... Silly of me to think that you could ever really want me too How I love you... Chorus: You're just a lover out to score I know that I should be looking for more What could it be in you I see What could it be... Oh, Love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me Oh, Love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me [Verse 2:] Silly of me to think that you could ever know the things I do Are all done for you...
