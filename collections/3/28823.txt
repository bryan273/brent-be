I store the ready-to-drink kombucha in the refrigerator and have about one 16-ounce jar each day. Try not to drink more than 32 ounces a day or you may have an adverse reaction. Also, the process to brew a new batch and move the old batch to the mason jars takes me around 30 minutes once every 10 days.
