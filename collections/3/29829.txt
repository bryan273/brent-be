All you have to do is put on his leash and walk a few steps. When he inevitably starts to pull, you should turn and walk in the opposite direction. You’ll stop-and-start a lot at first, but eventually she’ll get it. You can reinforce this learning by rewarding him with praise or treats when he does follow. Practice obedience training. By the time your dog is ready to go out on walks, between months 3 and 6, it’s also a good window to start obedience training.
