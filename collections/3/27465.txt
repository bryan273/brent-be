Payments. The deadlines for making contributions to SEP IRAs are the same as those for creating the plan. You have until the filing deadline for your tax return, including extensions, to put money into the accounts. Even if you've already filed your return you still have until the deadline to make the deposits. So if you file for an extension before April 15, you have until Oct. 15 to make contributions to a SEP IRA for the previous year. This gives you an additional six months past the normal deadline for making IRA contributions.
