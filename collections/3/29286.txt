RMS Power Ratings: The RMS power rating is the measure of continuous power that an amplifier can output, or a speaker can handle. RMS power is derived from Root Mean Square which is a statistical measurement of the magnitude of a varying quantity and is applied to voltage or current. Yeahâ€¦you can disregard that and just concentrate on the fact that RMS power should be what you use to compare any car audio products.
