Laurelwood Entertainment. BBC/NBC Productions. On The Weakest Link, eight contestants (six in the syndicated version) competed to win a top amount by playing a quiz/elimination contest. At the end of each round, each player is voted off as The Weakest Link. In each round, the teamâ€™s goal is to reach the target of the maximum value within the time limit. They do that by correctly answering a series of questions posed by the host. The players on the team played one at a time from left to right.
