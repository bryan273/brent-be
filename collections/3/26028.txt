Initial disclaimer: This is by no means intended to be a full-blown explanation of trigonometry or its functions. This is just a helpful service to everyone who is coming to arctangent.net presumably seeking help with this particular function. arctangent (atan or tan -1 on some calculators) is used to calculate the angles of a right triangle. It works opposite of the tangent function.
