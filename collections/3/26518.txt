During all of this, Queensborough Township ceased to exist. Since no significant permanent towns were ever established in the 20,000 acre tract, the name Queensborough disappeared, not even recognized in the current state of South Carolina. To find where it once was, locate the small town of Pamplico in present-day Florence County and you will now know where the heart of Queensborough Township once was.
