We even call the most common cold-weather injury frostbite, not frost burn. However, a burn from an ice pack, cold wrap, or gel pack (or ice in a plastic bag) can be just as serious as a burn from heat. How do I know this? I used a cold pack incorrectly and ended up with a second-degree burn, which is still healing.
