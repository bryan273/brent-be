To tell if you're working out at a proper intensity, use the talk test while you exercise. Your workout should be intense enough to make you breathe deeply and to make you feel a little winded. But, you should still be able to carry on a conversation while you exercise. If you don't have enough breath to get the words out, you're working too hard.
