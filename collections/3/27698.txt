The baby will be growing at a fast rate during the last 4 weeks and you still need a good balance of quality and variety of food. I gained almost 12 kg till now, is it too much? You can expect to gain about half a kilo weekly during this month, so if you deliver after 4 weeks, youâ€™ll have gained about 14 kg.
