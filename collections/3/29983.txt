On the day of the surgery drinking plenty of fluids (up to 2 quarts of liquid per day) and avoiding hot liquids or hot food because they will promote bleeding and swelling. Extremely hot food is also something to stay away from and patients shouldnâ€™t use a straw for the first few days after surgery.
