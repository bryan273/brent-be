Eggs are a source of high-quality, complete protein. Both egg yolks and whites are sources of dietary protein. However, the nutritional value -- including the amount of protein -- differs between the yolks and whites of eggs. Regardless of whether you choose the yolk, egg white or whole eggs, adding eggs to your diet can help you meet your daily protein needs.
