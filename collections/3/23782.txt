The Deductible Amount formula also applies to Non Commutable Account Based Pensions. The Deductible Amount is the amount of your income stream that IS NOT assessed for Centrelink purposes. The formula to determine the Deductible Amount varies depending on the type of income stream.he calculation for the minimum is around $14,700. However using the formula, and a fresh start, my number is 15.49 and hence deductible amount for Centrelink purpose calculates at $26,469, which will suit me just fine as I need to draw that much anyway.
