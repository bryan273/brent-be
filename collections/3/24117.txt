La Original Frita Cubana - The Original Cuban Burger. Our journey began when our late founder, Victoriano “Benito” Gonzalez, and his wife Angelina “Gallega” Gonzalez arrived in Miami in the 1970s as a means of escaping political unrest within their home country of Cuba. Once settled, they got straight to work on a product that would resonate throughout the community.
