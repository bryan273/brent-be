So I do seated work outs. Spark People has a short seated work out in one of their videos and you can also order videos. The ones I like are Chair Salsa with David Stamps, Jodi Stolove's Chair Dancing and Chair Aerobics for Everyone. Basically I cycle through those three videos when I can't do a Leslie Sansone walk.
