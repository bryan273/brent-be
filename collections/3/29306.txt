I'm assuming that by America you mean The United States. There's no country called America. Even when excluding Taiwan and other disputed territories, China is larger than the United States, both in terms of land area, and in terms of land area including inland waterbodies. By land area only: China: 9,326,410 sq km. United States: 9,161,966 sq km, 1.8% smaller than China.
