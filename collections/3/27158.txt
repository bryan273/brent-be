Note: caffeine and alcohol are dehydrating in the body, so try to avoid them. If you do drink them during this re-hydration program, you would need to drink an extra glass or two of water just to gain back what you will lose. 2. Drink enough water daily. In order to rehydrate a dehydrated body, you need to drink at least one-half ounce per pound of body weight daily. So, for example, if you weigh 180 pounds, you would drink 90 ounces (about 3 quarts) of water. During exercise or hot weather, you should increase your water intake significantly, depending on how much you sweat, how long you exercise, or how hot the temperature is.
