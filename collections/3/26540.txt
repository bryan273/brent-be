Ohioans were among the earliest and most prominent pioneers in the use of electricity. Leading the way, in 1879, Charles Brush developed arc lighting, providing an easy and cost-effective way to light cities at night. Brush introduced his invention in Cleveland, Ohio, making this city the first one in the world to have electric streetlights. Ohioan Thomas Edison developed a usable light bulb, among dozens of other inventions utilizing electricity. Benjamin Lamme accumulated 162 patents, most dealing with improvements in electricity's use, during his lifetime.
