Step 1. Using a grout saw, scrape away as much grout around the tile as possible. Work slowly to avoid damaging the drywall or backing underneath. Creating this gap around the tile keeps the force of chisel blows on the broken tile from breaking the adjoining tiles.tep 7. Use a premixed grout/adhesive or mix grout to the consistency of peanut butter and use the tip of a plastic putty knife to press it into the grooves surrounding the tile. Also, fill any grout areas damaged during removal of the tile.
