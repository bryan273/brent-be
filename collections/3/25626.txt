Concealed Nests or Cavity Nests. Honeybees will seek out hollows in trees, abandoned rodent burrows, and the voids between walls to establish their nests. The nest is constructed entirely of wax in a characteristic honeycomb pattern. Each cell of the honeycomb will house a single egg or developing bees.
