Most of these models are between age 14-19 and most have not yet developed into a woman's body. Very few (if any) women are genetically capable of attaining the body shapes and sizes that are presented in the media. Even models don't look like the air-brushed images that are displayed in magazines and on billboards. The average American woman is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs about 140 pounds.
