I’ve enjoyed Colleen Hoover’s books (the few that I’ve read), but I’ve never read Tarryn Fisher’s books. May have to give her books a try. Thanks for sharing! novella comes with the expectation that it will have a distinct beginning, middle and end (a small story arc). In part one, there isn’t a complete story arc. Never Never ends in the middle of a scene. Many have called it a cliffhanger but to me it is more of a to-be-continued ending.
