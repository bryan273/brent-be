MAJORGROUPS:PROTIST’SDomain: Eukarya Kingdom:Protista. 2  2. 3  Chromalveolata To determine if a protist species is a part of this phylum is based on two pieces of confirmation. 4  First of all, some of the DNA sequence data propose that this phylum forms a monophyletic group. Stramenopiles main characteristic is the flagellum that each protist has. 2  In most protists in this phylum, the hairy flagellum is paired with a short smooth flagellum. o Diatoms: Diatoms are unicellular and are producers of the food chain. 3  These organisms have a cell wall that is made of silica.
