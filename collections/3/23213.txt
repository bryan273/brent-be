Some combination pills contain a few monthsâ€™ worth of active pills. They are specially packaged to reduce the number of periods a woman has each year. Women can also take the active pills in 21-day or 28-day packs continuously to reduce how often they have periods. Progestin-only pills come only in 28-day packs.
