In the first six weeks or so of life, children will fall asleep anywhere, but once a baby is about 2 months old, the external stimulation in a mall, park, or supermarket can keep her from getting the sound, restful sleep she needs. Many kids doze off easily in the car but generally wake up once the ride is over.
