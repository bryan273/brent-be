In this article Iâ€™d like to briefly outline the concept of intersubjectivity. The intersubjective. sharing of experience is a concept that has significant power for understanding. relationships, interactions, and treatment (in this article I use the term treatment to refer. to psychotherapy and therapeutic parenting). Intersubjectivity is a process that occurs. within all relationships at all times.
