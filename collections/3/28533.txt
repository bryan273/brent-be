Total ride time is expected to be about three minutes. Right now, the world's tallest roller coaster is Kingda Ka, which stands 456 feet, at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Passengers will take a glass elevator up to the ride, enjoying stunning views of the city. After boarding, that's when the fun begins.
