You may notice that the 1156 and 7507 bulbs have tabs on the base that do not exactly match. The 1156's tabs are 180 degrees while the 7507 tabs are 150 degrees. These two bulbs may not seem compatible, but there is a very simple modification that can be done to the bulb's base to fit it into the housing. An example would be a 2007 BMW E90 325i. A product description may advertise the bulb as P21, but that could mean a 1156 or 7507 bulb.
