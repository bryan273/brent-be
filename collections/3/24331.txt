As with most certifications, medical coder certification requires either education or experience to sit for a certification exam. Though certification is not required to work as a medical coder, it will improve your chances of getting hired if you don't have much experience. Several agencies offer certification, but the most recognized in the US is the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA).
