Early Withdrawals from a Roth IRA. Penalty-free early withdrawals for Roth IRAs apply to only two circumstances: first â€“time home purchase or death or disability of a family member. However, the penalty for early withdrawal from a Roth IRA only applies to earrings, since you have already paid taxes on the principle.
