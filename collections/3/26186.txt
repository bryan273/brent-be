I'm more of a mixed class character. I always take along different loadouts with me in a safe. But I am partial towards my spear. (Gungnir FTW!) But really, the best sword is the Terra Blade or the Horseman's blade, best spear is the Mushroom Spear, the best flail is the Flairon, and the best spell is just a matter of one's playstyle. The best gun is the Zapinator, which was removed from the game.
