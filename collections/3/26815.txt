Philip Kerr’s Berlin Noir series was published between 1989 and 1991, and introduced the world to Bernie Gunther. Strangely, it wasn’t until 2006 that the books March Violets, The Pale Criminal and A German Requiem were followed up with The One from the Other, and since then the Edinburgh-born author has been bringing us regular episodes from the life of his tough, resourceful and compassionate hero.
