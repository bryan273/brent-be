Q. I have always been told that there was an age of accountability in scripture, meaning that children who die before a certain age are automatically saved. I've even heard a preacher quote Romans 7:9 saying when we become aware that our sin separates us from God, sin is revived in us and then we are held accountable to God from that point.
