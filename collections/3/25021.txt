RSV stands for Respiratory Syncytial Virus -- a virus that affects the respiratory tract, usually in children under two. When adults and older children have it, it's usually very mild. Small children and infants admitted to the hospital with respiratory illness often have RSV, and it's most common in early spring and winter.
