Sears opened along with Fashion Place in 1971. It closed in the spring of last year after Sears Holdings Corp. sold 11 of its national stores, including the Fashion Place outlet and another in Provo, to General Growth Properties. Sears continues to have other locations in Utah including in downtown Salt Lake City and West Jordan. Demolition will finish in the next two weeks, said a mall spokeswoman. A replacement store for the spot Dillard's is vacating on the north end of Fashion Place has not been found yet, she said.
