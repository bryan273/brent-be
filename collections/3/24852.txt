If there is no halal for some product, so muslim people are not going to buy and use it thus the empoloyer/board of director whether muslim or not cannot conquer the big scope of consumer….i think you should study this a little bit more….alal slaughter requires that Muslims perform all halal rituals. The end result is that Muslims begin to “take over” food production jobs of a nation. The idea that Muslims – who wish to eliminate non-Muslims – control any aspect of non-Muslim food production is disturbing.
