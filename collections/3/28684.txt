National Association of Mortgage Processors®. VA Training Tips. I’ve been writing so much lately about FHA that I decided to ‘switch things up a bit’ this week and provide some quality tips and information that I think you’ll find helpful for VA processing. VA training is hard to come by as many of you have probably found. It’s not out there all over the place on the web like FHA training is. The thing is it actually is out there. You probably just haven’t run across it because you’re not a “psycho website searcher” like I am.
