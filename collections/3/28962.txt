Potato plants grow wild all over South America and as far north as Colorado and Nebraska in North America. About 15,000 years ago, when people first came to North America from Asia, they began to eat the potato roots and the roots of similar plants like camas and wapato that they found there. Sometime around 8000 BC, in the Andes Mountains in South America, people began to farm potatoes as well as gathering them.
