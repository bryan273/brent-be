Pay Your Tax Bill: If you receive a bill from the IRS, you’ll save money by paying your taxes owed as soon as you can. If you can’t pay them all at once, you should pay as much as you can. That way, you'll reduce your penalties and interest for late payment. Use IRS Direct Pay: The IRS website has a Direct Pay tool.
