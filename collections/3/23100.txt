I have two criticisms that are minor issues in comparison to the overall quality of the components and engineering. 1  The built-in fan provides minimal relief, which is true with most fitness equipment. 2  I would rate the console and display as average. 3  There are better displays in the $1,000 â€“ $2,000 range.
