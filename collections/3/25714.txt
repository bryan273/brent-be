In order to start attracting butterflies, you need to start thinking and seeing like butterflies. If we were to see like a butterfly, we would look at really bright colors, says butterfly expert Rachel Diaz-Bastin of the Conservatory of Flowers in San Francisco. Their favorite colors are red, yellow and blue, because those are the flowers that are really bright and advertise that they have sugary water and good nectar for them to drink.
