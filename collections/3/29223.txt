Glacier National Park was formed by an Act of Congress on May 11, 1910. George Bird Grinnell, editor of Forest & Stream (later Field & Stream) magazine and an early proponent of the park is given much credit for generating the will to establish Glacier as a park.he majority of the rocks in the park were formed in a shallow sea environment called the Belt Sea.. This ancient seabed harbored only some of the earliest and most primitive forms of sea life, stromatolites, and the oldest rocks in the park may be up to 1.5 billion years old.
