SHOP: Nike Kobe A.D. The “Big Stage” colorway returns to the Kobe line. The Nike Kobe A.D. Big Stage takes inspiration from the Kobe 5 that released in 2010 and was worn by Kobe in the NBA Finals when he helped the Los Angeles Lakers defeat the Boston Celtics. The shoe comes in a clean White and Metallic Gold color scheme, the same colors used on the Nike Kobe 5 Big Stage that dropped back in 2007.
