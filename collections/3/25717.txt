Set up a butterfly bath â€” which is like a birdbath with sand in it. Put a little bit of water into a shallow bowl, not so much that they can drown in it, but just enough so the sand is wet. They'll do what is called puddling; the males try to soak up nutrients like salts from the water and the sand.
