The most common method of wintering geraniums is to place them in a pot and keep them indoors for the winter. You will want to keep them at a cooler temperature, so the basement might be a perfect place for your flowering plants.s soon as the weather is warm enough outside, you can place the plant back outdoors. Another way to save your plants during the winter is to take the plant out of the soil with the roots exposed. Hang them in a cooler, undisturbed area. Place them in a clear plastic bag that contains wet peat moss.
