Currently in the U.S., all underground propane tanks are made of steel and conform to the. American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The cost. of steel is increasing and additional costs are incurred for corrosion protection if the tank is. buried. The result is a significant rise in the overall cost of underground propane tanks. Composite materials are used for a variety of structural components because of their lighter. weight and higher resistance to chemical attack, including corrosion. Composite materials are.
