An embryo has 23 pairs of chromosomes, each made up of a sperm and an ovum. The 23rd pair of chromosomes determine the sex of the baby. The ovum always gives an X and the sperm gives X or Y. The genes prompt the gonads to become either testes (XY) or ovaries (XX). In XY, the testes release testosterone which stimulates the development of male internal organs.
