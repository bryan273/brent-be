The first time I used the shoulder inferno wrap and the freezie wrap was to treat a rotator cuff injury I sustained from over use and aging. I was in my early 60's and an avid tennis player,kayaker, skier, hiker and biker for most of my life.he rotator cuff is a shallow 'ball-and-socket' joint where the humerus (upper arm) meets the scapula (shoulder blade). 2-5% of the population will experience Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder), most for no apparent reason.
