To approximate the probability that the sum is equal to 6, I count the number of 6's in my experiments (5) and divide by the total number of experiments (50). That is, the probability of observing a 6 is roughly the relative frequency of 6's. In general, the probability of an event can be approximated by the relative frequency , or proportion of times that the event occurs. The observed relative frequency is just an approximation to the true probability of an event. However, if we were able to perform our process more and more times, the relative frequency will eventually approach the actual probability. We could demonstrate this for the dice example.
