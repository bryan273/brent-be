Psittacosis is caused in humans by exposure to the bacterium, Chlamydia psittaci, which is most often transmitted to humans from infected birds, especially parrots and poultry, especially turkeys. Most infections occur from handling of infected birds themselves or by working in areas where such birds are kept or butchered (occupational exposure).
