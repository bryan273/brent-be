Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, traces the problems faced by George Milton and Lennie Small, two migrant workers who have recently secured a job on a ranch in California. Lennie's surname, Small, is significant because Lennie is anything but small. He is a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders.. The irony of his name, as the story unfolds, is not lost on the reader.
