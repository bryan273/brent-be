If any thing I wish was changed in this state is the tax credits and percentage the state receives. I often get a decent refund on federal only for the state to get most of it. But this year I got a 12 dollar refund LOL so I guess I should be happy. I am a retiree from the Federal Government (30+ years 1974 - 2005). We have recently moved to North Carolina.
