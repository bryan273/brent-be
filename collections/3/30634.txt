Algae use various combinations of the major chlorophyll pigments, chlorophyll a, b, and c, mixed with a wide array of other pigments that give some of them very distinctive colors. 2. Some protists are heterotrophs, a group of phyla called the protozoa.Heterotrophs get their energy by consuming other organisms. Protists reproduce asexually by binary fission, and a few species are capable of sexual reproduction.ll protists are aquatic. Many protists can move through the water by means of flagella, or cilia, or pseudopodia (= false feet). Cilia and flagella are tiny movable hairs. Motile cells usually have one or two long flagella, or numerous shorter cilia.
