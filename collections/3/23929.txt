ProShow Gold is great - I'm using version 6.0.3410. It's intuitive, easy to add audio, the transitions look great and there are many to choose from. There's also a helpful wizard if you want to let the program do some work for you, then tweak afterwards. It was a real relief to find a program that worked after sifting through so much junk.
