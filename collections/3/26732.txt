The flowers are also used as part of what hula dancers wear, particularly those who perform the hula 'auana, or modern hula. People also wear the Plumeria generally for its beauty. People who wear it behind the right ear are identifying themselves as single or available; people who wear it behind the left ear are identifying themselves as married or in a relationship.
