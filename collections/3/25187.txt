Giant Godly Head of Wisdom and Knowledge. His head was hacked off by the VANIR but ODIN applied herbal therapy and restored it to life. MIMIR then became the Talking Head at the Spring of Knowledge by the YGGDRASIL Tree. He knows the secrets of the universe and has one of ODINâ€™s eyes, which forms part of his very own Neighborhead Watch team. If we knew where he could be found it would make things a lot easier. A map might be useful.
