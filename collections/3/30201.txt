Annular Space Grouting. As the nation's pipeline infrastructure continues to age, more emphasis must be placed on repairing these underground systems. Sliplining and relining are two solutions that allow the installation of new pipe without having to dig a new trench. The existing pipe becomes “the host” for a new carrier pipe which is slipped into place. The annular space between the two pipes is then grouted to protect against shock and corrosion. The result is a “good as new” pipeline installed at substantial savings compared to traditional installation methods.
