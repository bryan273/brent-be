Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by this book, and even though this is part one I still expected more from it. Never Never takes the reader on a mysterious journey with Charlie and Silas as they try to remember their pasts and their identities. novella comes with the expectation that it will have a distinct beginning, middle and end (a small story arc). In part one, there isnâ€™t a complete story arc. Never Never ends in the middle of a scene. Many have called it a cliffhanger but to me it is more of a to-be-continued ending.
