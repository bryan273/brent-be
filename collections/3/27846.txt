Fortunately the inaccessibility of the spot market does not matter now as much as it used to, because you can get very close to spot gold dealing on BullionVault. Never mind 400oz bars, you can get close to spot prices, with properly allocated physical gold, all the way down to one gram ($42 at May 2014 prices - view the live spot gold price chart).
