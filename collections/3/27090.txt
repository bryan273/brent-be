If a crest from one wave happens to line up with the trough of another, they cancel each other out. This is called destructive interference. If two waves line up crest to crest or trough to trough, they add up. This is called constructive interference. This is why waves at the beach are all different sizes. There are lots of different wave groups coming in, and theyâ€™re interfering with each other in different ways.
