Grout locks a tile in place, sealing the joints between individual pieces. Remove the grout from around the tile with a grout saw or rotary tool, cutting as deeply as you possibly can. Throw the chipped pieces out and wipe up any excess dust.ut the tile in place and twist it back and forth to spread the mortar. Tap the tile down with a flat board and mallet. Remove excess mortar that squeezes into the joints. Let the mortar cure, then grout and seal the joints.
