IRELAND, says the country's finance minister, Brian Lenihan, does not need a bail-out from the European Union, the IMF or anyone else, and it has not asked for one.But help is at hand, however Mr Lenihan describes it.he ECB is said to have pressed Ireland to avail itself of aid from the euro zone's rescue fund, created earlier this year, to reopen market financing for its banks. Investors fret that Ireland's banks might need yet more support if a weak economy spurs a wave of further defaults on property loans.
