If you're looking for Mark Wahlberg this weekend, don't go to Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy's wedding -- TMZ has learned he won't be there, and we're told it's because he and his wife aren't fans of the bride. According to multiple Wahlberg sources, Mark is not as close with Donnie and Jenny as Jenny has made it seem.
