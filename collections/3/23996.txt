For cheese making, rennet from the animal providing the milk is used (calf rennet for cow’s milk cheese for example.)There is a traditional way to get animal rennet, which involves combining the stomach of the animal with salt water or whey along with wine or vinegar.f you are vegetarian, then avoid any cheese with rennet, animal rennet, or enzymes (which typically means animal rennet, although not always, but there’s no easy way to know) listed in the ingredients. Vegetable rennet will be listed as such, same with microbial rennet.
