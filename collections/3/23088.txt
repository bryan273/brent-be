If a state has 100 delegates and a candidate wins 60 percent of the vote in the state's primary, then that candidate will have 60 delegates from that state at the national convention -- the party nomination night.hen a candidate wins delegates in a state -- either by proportion of votes or winner-takes-all -- those delegates are presumed to be committed to voting for that candidate at the convention. Each party has a finite number of delegates who are up for grabs in the primaries.
