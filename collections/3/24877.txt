I was a wanna-be actor from Milwaukee who was about to become famous overnight. Yep, it's me, Kato Kaelin. I'm about as irrelevant as the b in the word subtle, but I'm still around 20 years later. This is my story. Well, part of my story, anyway. It's about my love-hate relationship with the media and what has happened in the 20 years since The Trial of the Century..
