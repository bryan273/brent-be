Claims of snakes larger than this in the wild are unofficial : a python caught in Indonesia in 2004 was reported to be 15 meters (over 49 feet), weighing 450 kg (990 lb). Although the <i>anaconda</i> is a thicker, heavier snake, some pythons are the world's longest snakes. The reticulated python of Southeast Asia has an average length of up to 4 to 6 meters (13 to 21 feet), the largest measuring 9.7 meters (nearly 32 feet).
