Solve: Proof of cos(x) : from the derivative of sine. This can be derived just like sin(x) was derived or more easily from the result of sin(x). Given: sin(x) = cos(x); Chain Rule. Solve: Proof of tan(x) : from the derivatives of sine and cosine. Given: sin(x) = cos(x); cos(x) = -sin(x); Quotient Rule. Solve: Proof of csc(x), sec(x), cot(x) : from derivatives of their reciprocal functions. Given: sin(x) = cos(x); cos(x) = -sin(x); tan(x) = cot(x); Quotient Rule. Solve:
