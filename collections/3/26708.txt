Where to record or file a lien. In Nebraska, liens are recorded with the Register of Deeds for the county in which the property is located. In Iowa, lien documents are not recorded with the Register of Deeds of any particular county. Rather, Iowa has established an online database for filing lien related documents called the Mechanic’s Notice and Lien Registry (the “MNLR”). All lien related documents must be filed on the MNLR for the lien to be valid.
