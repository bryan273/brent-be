● Only ticks that are attached and have finished feeding or are near the end of their meal can transmit Lyme disease. After arriving on the skin, the tick that spreads Lyme disease usually takes 24 hours before feeding begins. ● Even if a tick is attached, it must have taken a blood meal to transmit Lyme disease.
