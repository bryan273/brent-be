1 Borrow a page from the Japanese drift scene playbook with these bumper quick release fasteners. Originally used to allow drifters to quickly replace loose body parts, quick release bumper fasteners are useful to hold on any lightweight body part that, for whatever reason, needs to be held on with a simple aftermarket fix. Looks much better than zip ties, and is easier to detach and re-attach in the pits.
