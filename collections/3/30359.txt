It also contains nutrients, esculin, and ferric citrate. When an organism hydrolyzes the glycoside esculin to form esculetin and dextrose, the esculetin reacts with the ferric citrate to produce a dark brown or black phenolic iron complex. If an organism can hydrolyze esculin, the media will turn dark brown or black. However, the test is interpreted as a positive result only if more than half the medium is dark brown or black after incubation. The bile esculin handout is here.
