These are ball-park figures: it is easy enough to find the average GMAT scores for the intake in a given year to individual business schools. Note that as well as an overall score and a percentile, the test report includes the scores and percentiles for both the verbal and quantitative sections of the test.he maximum scaled score for the test is 800: verbal and quantitative sections are each worth 800 points. The final score is an average of these two scores. The student can get the results at the test center immediately after the GMAT-CAT. This is not an official score as the results of the writing section come later.
