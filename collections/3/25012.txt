Bust of Nerva the Emperor. Domitians murder marked the end of the Flavian dynasty and changed the rules of succession. Nerva and Trajan (ruled 96 – 98 AD, 98 – 117 AD) were not born to rule, but were chosen for the job. The results were remarkably successful. Nerva became emperor immediately after Domitians murder in 96 AD. He had a lifetime of service to Rome and its emperors, and had served as consul twice, in 71 and 90 AD.
