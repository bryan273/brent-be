Nicotine Toxicology. By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. Nicotine is a highly toxic chemical. While in rats, a dose of 50 mg per kg is lethal, in mice the median lethal dose is around 3 mg per kg weight. In humans, the median lethal dose is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg or around 40 to 60 mg in an average human. This low lethal dose makes nicotine more toxic than many other compounds including even alkaloids such as cocaine which has a median lethal dose of 95.1 mg per kg in mice.
