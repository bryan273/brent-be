1. Enzymes catalyse only those reactions that happen naturally. 2. Enzymes are specific: each enzyme is responsible for only 1 kind of reaction, because they are shaped to work with only a certain substrate that matches enzyme's active site. 3. Enzyme changes its conformation when substrate bonds to its active site. This creates stress on the substrate's bond making them easier to break (induced fit model) 4. Enzymes are not changed by the reaction. They are needed in small quantities, because they are reused.
