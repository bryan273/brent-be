Report Abuse. The Hulk is more stronger but his power depends on his anger. So when he gets really angry and turns into Gray Hulk he is practically unstoppable, but Bruce Banner isn't much of a threat. I think the Juggernaut is more powerful though because he is indestructible and can absorb energy.
