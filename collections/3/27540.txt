Density of an object doesnâ€™t change with the size of the sample, and hence, called an intensive property. Density is the ratio between mass to volume, and therefore, has the physical dimensions of ML -3. Measuring unit for density may be kilograms per cubic meter (kgm -3) or grams per millilitre (g/ml).
