Best Answer: Pixels come in different sizes, so there can be no answer to your question. A poster of fifteen by twenty inches, with a graphic resolution of 100 pixels per inch will be 1500 by 2000 pixels. The same size poster, at 300 pixels per inch will be 4500 pixels by 6000 pixels. The second poster, while the exact same dimensions will have pixels much smaller than the first. Smaller pixels means higher resolution.
