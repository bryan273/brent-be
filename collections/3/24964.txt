To summarize - partitioning is a generic term that just means dividing your logical entities into different physical entities for performance, availability, or some other purpose. Horizontal partitioning, or sharding, is replicating the schema, and then dividing the data based on a shard key. Vertical partitioning involves dividing up the schema (and the data goes along for the ride).
