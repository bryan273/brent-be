Reviewed July 5, 2016. This review of the Dolly Sods Wilderness focuses on the Red Creek Trailhead (located on the border of Tucker and Randolph counties). The experiences here may not be consistent with other areas of the Dolly Sods Wilderness area because the area is HUGE and likely very different in other areas.
