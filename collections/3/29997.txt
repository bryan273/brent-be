Overturned carriage. 1  I was walking on the street when a man with a horse-drawn vehicle overturned. 2  I dreamt that my best friend T and I were on a trip to India and we stood in a line and had to choose which caste system we would fit in. 3  Early this morning, I had a dream that I visited a psychic with my mom & brother.
