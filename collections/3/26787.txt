Lets also add that the tour x stiff shaft 169D on the ping is the stiffest standard shaft you can get on a driver without a paying or second hand swop... The Titleist D3 driver is a lower trajectory driver that feels very dead when you hit it.I think one needs an aftermarket pro shaft to get that club going.riginally Posted by Pky6471 Good to hear that you found a new love... My friend got the new G20 (not sure about the shaft) and he loves it also... Lets hope it's not just a honeymoon period The driver to have now is the Ping Anser. I tried the G20 in the simulator and I thought it felt great.
