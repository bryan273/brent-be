Many of Algeria's key towns and cities lie along the northern coastal region, where places such as Annaba and Constantine have long histories dating back to Roman times and before. There are also ancient urban centres located at oases in the interior of the country, such as Timimoun and Ghardaia in the M'zab Valley. For the most adventurous, the desert south offers unique landscapes and environments, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tassili N'Ajjer.
