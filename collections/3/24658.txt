On the flip side, a few groups are anaerobic and intolerant of oxygenated water. These organisms are often endosymbionts living in the digestive system of multi-celled animals. Protists use contractile vacuoles to remove excess water from their cells. If the contractile function of a cell is compromised, the cell swells until it ruptures.
