Describes a person who tries to be emo but fails, or in other words, wannabe emo. Most wemo people listen to Good Charlotte and Simple Plan while taking pictures of their secretly happy selves in toques and unconvincabley sad expressions. A lot of wemo people DON'T know how to put on eyeliner and many of them sport buzzcuts. Tsk tsk. My life sucks.
