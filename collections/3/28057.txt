If signs point to lung cancer, more tests will be done. Here are some of the tests you may need: Chest x-ray: This is often the first test used to look for spots on your lungs. If the x-ray is normal, you most likely don't have lung cancer. If a change is seen, you will need more tests. CT scan: This is also called a “CAT scan.” A CT scan is a special kind of x-ray that takes pictures of your insides.
