To see parts for your range/stove/oven, you need to enter your model number on the right. The system will then display parts that are associated with your range/stove/oven. How it Works: To determine if the light switch is defective, use a multimeter to test it for continuity.he touchpad has a button that controls the oven light. If this button is defective, the touchpad wonâ€™t signal the oven control board to turn on the oven light. However, this is rarely the case. First test the light bulb, socket, and switch.
