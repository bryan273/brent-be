In broad brush strokes, what has been learned is that in most mammalian cells, phospholipids account for approximately 60% of total lipids by number and sphingolipids make up another â‰ˆ10%. Non-polar sterol lipids range from 0.1% to 40% depending on cell type and which subcellular compartment is under consideration.
