From left to right: the two isomeric groups propyl and 1-methylethyl (or isopropyl), and the non-isomeric cyclopropyl group. In organic chemistry, propyl is a linear three-carbon alkyl substituent with chemical formula â€“CH 2CH 2CH 3. It is the substituent form obtained by removing one hydrogen atom attached to the terminal carbon of propane. A propyl substituent is often represented in organic chemistry with the symbol Pr (not to be confused with the element praseodymium). There is an isomeric form of propyl named 1-methylethyl or isopropyl obtained by removing a hydrogen ion (proton) attached to the middle carbon of propane. Linear propyl is sometimes termed normal and written with a prefix n- (i.e., n-propyl).
