SOLAS is an international maritime safety treaty designed to ensure that ships comply with minimum safety standards in construction, equipment and operation. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has announced that this new container weighing legislation will come into force from July 1, 2016. With the first ever version of the treaty passed in response to the sinking of the Titanic in 1914, SOLAS in itself is not new. However, the forthcoming introduction of mandatory verification of shippersâ€™ declared container weights will require all containers to be weighed before being shipped.
