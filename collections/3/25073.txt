When a nerve impulse is triggered, sodium and potassium pass through the cell membrane along the concentration gradient. To return the concentration gradient to its initial state, the membrane protein must continually pump sodium out of the cell and bring potassium into the cell. This requires energy from the cell.ransport that is “active” is different in that it requires the energy of certain membrane proteins to get across the concentration gradient and either into or out of the cell.
