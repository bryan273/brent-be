No, rather you are just dull and have a closed mind, lack appreciation for technology, and are ignorant of the possibilities and variety of available technology. I am very happy that Cathode Ray Tubes are making a comeback. I have a 27″ Sony Trinitron curved CRT TV from the year 1998. I watch VHS, DVD movies and play older video games. In the future, I would like to see new CRT TV’s to come back to the production line mainly for classic gaming use.
