The beach with the shipwreck of the metallic ship lying on the beach, semi-buried in the white sand is the most easily recognisable and the most photographed beach in Greece. It is situated at a distance of some 36,5 kilometers northwestern to the town of Zakynthos and 4 kilometers western to Volimes.
