Mark Engler September 22, 2010. I recently started shopping at a grocery store that is conveniently located near where I live, but that unfortunately doesn’t have a lot of organic food options. What it does have is a lot of Newman’s Own products. A company founded by Paul Newman and a friend, writer A. E. Hotchner, in 1982, Newman’s Own is known by many people for its flagship line of all-natural salad dressings. But in the past decade or so the brand has expanded dramatically, and it now has products in many aisles of my local store.
