Often, a good salad is all you need with a juicy steak. Some people prefer a basic iceberg lettuce and tomato salad or a side of coleslaw, but choose from a variety of salad greens and dressings. For a tasty, leafy salad, toss tomato slices, cucumbers and mixed salad greens -- like spinach, arugula and radicchio -- in a vinaigrette.
