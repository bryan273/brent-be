I have seen many ads throughout the years that have offered more pay for being bilingual. However, the pay differences have been minimal. As in, a non-bilingual RN makes $30 dollars an hour and a bilingual RN may make $30.50 an hour.Although I have heard of some people that there are bilingual RN's that make considerably more but they had to really fight for the pay raise. In my opinion, if all you are offered is a .50 cents raise, just take it. have seen many ads throughout the years that have offered more pay for being bilingual.
