The Visigoths (Low Latin Visigothi,the good Goths or the noble Goths) were the western Goths, with a domain extending from the Dniester to the Danube rivers. About 100 years after the birth of Christ an ancient Teutonic people began moving out of northern Europe. In time they overran the Roman Empire.
