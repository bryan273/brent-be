Water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen are among the few simple molecules that can cross the cell membrane by diffusion (or a type of diffusion known as osmosis). Diffusion is one principle method of movement of substances within cells, as well as the method for essential small molecules to cross the cell membrane.eceptor-mediated endocytosis occurs when the material to be transported binds to certain specific molecules in the membrane. Examples include the transport of insulin and cholesterol into animal cells. Endocytosis and exocytosis.
