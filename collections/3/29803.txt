When energy needs to be generated as fast as possible- in short sharp bursts, the body relies on each cells small amount of energy which soon runs out. The fastest way to grab another phosphate to convert ADP to ATP is to grab it off the cells Creatine phosphate, creating extra ATP to make the cells energy last a little longer. Short, sharp explosive bursts of exercise (10-30 secs) use this system.
