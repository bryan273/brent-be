1,2-dehydro pyrrolizidine ester alkaloids (PA) are toxic for human and livestock. The PAs undergo a metabolic toxication process in the liver which is the first target organ for PA poisoning. World-wide many episodes of PA intoxications have been reported involving humans as well as ruminants. This intoxication is not only related to the amount and duration of the exposure to PAs but also to species, age and gender. Besides the metabolic toxification, detoxication processes are also important.
