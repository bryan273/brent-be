Have a small mixing bowl ready to gather the juice and a strainer. Turn on the juicer and place the fruit and vegetable through until all are juiced. Place the carrot-orange juice through a strainer (small batches at a time) with a small mixing bowl underneath to catch the juice. Strain and pour into a carafe.
