Progesterone belongs to the class of medications called progestins. It is used in combination with postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to prevent the estrogen from thickening the lining of the uterus (a condition known as endometrial hyperplasia). This significantly reduces the risk of endometrial cancer.
