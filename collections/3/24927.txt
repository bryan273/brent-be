CRT's definitely are a great buy nowadays. Make sure the one you get has a flat screen, though. I'm not talking about thickness but the way that early CRT screens bulge towards the middle of the screen. Also, you shouldn't have to settle with a CRT that only supports PAL, most later ones support both PAL and NTSC.
