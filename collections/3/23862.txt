Origins are traced to the progressive movement which advocated a wide range of economic, political, social, and moral reforms during the Progressive Era in the 1880s and which lasted through the 1920s. Primary elections [therefore] emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. About 16 states began using primary elections then. Two major developments are said to have led to the emergence of statewide primary elections: 2) the rejection of the party convention system for candidate selection. The first presidential primary election was held in 1901 in Florida, and by 1916, presidential primary laws had been passed in 26 states. More than 40 of the 50 states hold primary elections by 2005.
