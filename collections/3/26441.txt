Unfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not track pay specific to pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs), but Indeed.com reports the average salary of PNPs to be $97,000 while payscale.com reports the median pay to be $77,782.nd, as of May 2013, it showed that the median annual wage (remember this is a number right in the middle) for all types of nurse practitioners was $92,670. NPs who were in the lowest 10 percent of earners had salaries of as little as $66,960 while those in the upper 10 percent made as much as $126,250 annually.
