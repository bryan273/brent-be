The names of these muscle-tendon components of the rotator cuff are: 1  the supraspinatus which runs over the top of the ball of the shoulder joint (humeral head); 2  the subscapularis which runs across the front of the humeral head; and. 3  the infraspinatus and the teres minor which run across the back of the humeral head.otator cuff surgery can improve the mechanics of the shoulder but cannot make the joint as good as it was before the cuff tear. In many cases the tendons and muscles around the shoulder have been weakened from prolonged disuse before the surgery.
