Cost to Buy & Bury 1000 Gallon Propane Tank. Cost to Buy & Bury 1000 Gallon Propane Tank. Can anyone tell me what it might cost (in NEPA) to buy (outright) a 1000 gal propane tank and have it buried. I am thinking of using LPG Furnace it to back-up a heat pump. I'll also use the LPG for cooking and clothes dryer.
