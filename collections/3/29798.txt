All the chemical reactions in living things run off of these quarters (ATP). They don’t run off $10 bills (sugars/fats/proteins). One glucose will give you as much as 38 ATP, similar to the way a $10 bill will give you 40 quarters. A fat molecule is more like a $100 bill because it has that much more energy. Since ATP is found in all living things it’s sometimes called the energy currency of cells, which goes well with this laundromat analogy.
