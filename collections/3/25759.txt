It begins after the aortic valve where blood has left the heart, and ends in the superior and inferior vena cavae that bring deoxygenated blood from the organs back to the heart. Summary: The heart pumps blood through the coronary circulation to supply oxygen to the heart itself, and through the systemic circulation to supply the entire body other than the heart. Deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body enters into the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava. The blood enters the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts the blood is pushed into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.
