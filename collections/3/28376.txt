One Page Resume: Recruiters do not read your resume; they do a 15 - 30 second spot check of your resume. When your resume is too long, it just takes your best stuff-the stuff that would have made the one page cut - and dilutes it with more mediocre content.Lengthy resumes do not make you more impressive, and there are many other reasons to keep your resume short too. good rule of thumb is to keep your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience or at most two pages if you have more than 10 years of experience. And if you think you can't get your resume to just one page, trust me, you can !
