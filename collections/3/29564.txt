Thus the absorbed dose (in Gy) averaged over an entire organ and multiplied by a dimensionless factor, the radiation weighting factor, gives the equivalent dose. The unit for the quantity equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv). Thus, the relation is. equivalent dose (in Sv) = absorbed dose (in Gy) x radiation weighting factor. In the older system of units, equivalent dose was described by the unit rem and 1 Sv equals 100 rem or 1 mSv equals 0.1 rem.
