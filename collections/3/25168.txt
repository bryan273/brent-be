DEFINITION of 'Buck'. Buck is an informal reference to $1. In foreign exchange trader's slang, a buck is 1 million units of a dollar-base currency, most commonly the U.S. dollar. The term buck probably comes from the days when deerskins, or buckskins, were commonly traded. Fur trappers and farmers would trade bucks for goods.
