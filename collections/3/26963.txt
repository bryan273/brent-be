Spoon is a graphical user interface that allows you to design transformations and jobs that can be run with the Kettle tools â€” Pan and Kitchen. Pan is a data transformation engine that performs a multitude of functions such as reading, manipulating, and writing data to and from various data sources. Kitchen is a program that executes jobs designed by Spoon in XML or in a database repository. Jobs are usually scheduled in batch mode to be run automatically at regular intervals. Note: For a complete description of Pan or Kitchen, see the Pan and Kitchen user guides.
