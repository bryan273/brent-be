What is burning mouth syndrome? Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a relatively common problem. Patients who have this condition complain of abnormal sensations of the lining of the mouth. Many patients say that it feels like their mouth has been scalded, and that is why this condition is called burning mouth syndrome. Although we don't know exactly what causes BMS, most of the evidence points to a problem with the nerves that send information about our senses to the brain.
