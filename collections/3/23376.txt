Hosts and announcers. As was the case with the British version, Anne Robinson served as host for the NBC Weakest Link. George Gray, whose most notable hosting experience to that point was on Extreme Gong, hosted the syndicated version. The show's voice-over announcers were John Cramer (NBC) and Lisa Friedman (syndicated).
