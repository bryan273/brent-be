Efficacy: Studies have shown that methotrexate is effective in 70% to 80% of psoriasis patients. In a 2003 study of oral medications published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 60% of the patients who received methotrexate experienced partial remission; of those patients, 65% saw near-complete remission.
