When an uplift pushes a batholith or smaller body of hardened magma toward the surface. And sometimes when magma fails to reach the surface it hardens in to rock. Over time, the forces that wear away Earth's surface such as flowing water, ice, or wind-may strip away the layers above the hardened magma and finally expose it.
