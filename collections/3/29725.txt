We use three bruny island oyster farms on cloudy bay lagoon, great bay & adam's bay, where our oysters are grown for an average of eighteen months in some of the cleanest waters on the planet....our oysters are hand picked by steve, delivered live and then shucked to order at the hotel.here is no public transport to or on Bruny Island, so you will need to bring your own car or hire a car. Europcar, Hertz, Thrifty, Budget and Avis all hire cars in Tasmania and this can be arranged from all of the major cities and airports.
