The cytotrophoblast, deep inside, consists in an inner irregular layer of ovoid, single- nucleus cells. This is also where intensive mitotic activity takes place. In the periphery the syncytiotrophoblast forms a syncytium, i.e., a multi-nucleic layer without cell boundaries that arises from the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells.
