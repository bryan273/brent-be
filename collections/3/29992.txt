If the man is a stranger or unknown to you, he may be representing a shadow aspect of yourself – a positive or negative trait or characteristic that you are not consciously aware of, have repressed or denied. Ask yourself: • What is he saying? It may be a message you need to hear. • What is he doing? Actions speak louder than words.
