Turmeric is most commonly known as a spice from the ginger plant family. To make the familiar powdered spice, the rhizomes from turmeric are harvested, boiled, dried, and then ground. In addition to flavor, the bright or golden yellow spice adds color to traditional curry dishes, mustards, and cheeses.
