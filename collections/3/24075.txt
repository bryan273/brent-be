Federal Income Tax. Generally, unless you specify a monthly withholding rate or amount, we withhold Federal income tax as if you are married and claiming three allowances. Use Services Online to start, change, or stop the Federal tax withheld from your annuity payment or specify the dollar amount withheld. You can Contact Us to change your withholding amount. If you write, your letter should include your claim number and the monthly amount in dollars you want withheld.
