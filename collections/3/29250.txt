Achy pain is usually indicative of a muscle pull, whereas sharp pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament injuries. Bursitis and tendon pain in the shoulder is usually worse at night while in bed. 2. Apply an icepack to your shoulder. If your achy shoulder looks or feels swollen, then apply an icepack (or something cold) to the most tender area in order to reduce the inflammation and numb the pain.
