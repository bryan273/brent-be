Continuing the magic of the original Talk Stoop 'Doggy' Dog, Julio, today, Gracie claims a certain pride over her step, her stoop, and her celebrity. Gracie has appeared in over 300 Talk Stoop interviews and counting. Gracie tends to have a way with the older gentlemen who come by to interview with Cat. In this Gallery you'll find her pictured with Sir Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellen, Cesear Millan, and Kurt Sutter . . . a few of her most recent devotees.
