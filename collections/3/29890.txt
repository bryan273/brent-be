Step 1: Divide the New Value by the Old Value (you will get a decimal number). Step 2: Convert that to a percentage (by multiplying by 100 and adding a % sign). Step 3: Subtract 100% from that. Note: if the result is positive it is a percentage increase, if negative, just remove the minus sign and call it a decrease.hange: subtract old value from new value. Example: You had 5 books, but now have 7. The change is: 7-5 = 2. Percentage Change: show that as a percent of the old value ... so divide by the old value and make it a percentage: So the percentage change from 5 to 7 is: 2/5 = 0.4 = 40%.
