The most active volcano in the world is Kilauea, which is located on the southeastern part of the island of Hawaii, in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is Hawaii’s youngest volcano. Along with the nearby volcano Mauna Loa, Kilauea is part of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Kilauea’s slopes merge with those of Mauna Loa on the west and north.
