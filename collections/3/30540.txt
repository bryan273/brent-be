Concept 15 DNA and proteins are key molecules of the cell nucleus. In 1869, Friedrich Miescher isolated nuclein, DNA with associated proteins, from cell nuclei. He was the first to identify DNA as a distinct molecule. Phoebus Levene was an organic chemist in the early 1900's. He is perhaps best known for his incorrect tetranucleotide hypothesis of DNA.
