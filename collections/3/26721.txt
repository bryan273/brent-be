The cumulative risk of rupturing a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is related to aneurysm diameter. In a recent series of 133 patients with TAA, risk of rupture at 5 years was 0% for diameter less than 4 cm, 16% for diameter 4-5.9 cm, and 31% for aneurysms greater than 6 cm in diameter.horacic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a life-threatening condition that causes significant short-and long-term mortality due to rupture and dissection.
