Domesticated yaks (Bos Grunniens or the grunting ox) are thought to have been domesticated by Qiang herdsmen on the Tibetan (Qinghai) Plateau around 4,500 years ago. The Tibetan culture of the Himalayan Plateau is intertwined with yak just as Native American Plains Indian culture is intertwined with the American Bison.
