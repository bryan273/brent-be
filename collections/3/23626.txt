Best Time to Visit Fiji. Fiji is accessible to tourists for most time of the year. However, the best time to spend a fulfilling holiday in Fiji depends mostly on you. You can visit the Fiji during summer and spring seasons as they are mild (for European Fijis Fijis). Or you can choose to visit the Fiji during winters and enjoy sightseeing in the warm sun on a cold wintery morning!
