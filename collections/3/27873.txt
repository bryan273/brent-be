Zinfandel wine is considered to be the emblem of great Californian wine. The grapes are of Croatian origin, which are now indigenous to California. The wine is boldly fruit-forward, with a raspberry jam-like aroma, consistent with Zinfandel from cooler regions of the state â€” as compared to Zinfandel of the warmer regions, which produce a wine flavored with notes of anise, blackberry and pepper.
