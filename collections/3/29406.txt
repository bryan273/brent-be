No cards or effects, except other Counter Trap Cards can be chained to a Counter Trap Card. In Turbo Duels during the Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's anime, because the use of non-Speed Spell Spell Cards is restricted, duelists generally have a higher amount of Trap Cards in their Decks.rap Cards (Japanese: カード Torappu Kādo) are cards with purple-coloured borders that have various effects. Unless stated otherwise, a Trap Card must first be Set and can only be activated after the current turn has finished.
