Blood leaves the heart through vessels called arteries. When blood leaves the heart on it's way to the lungs, from the right ventricle, it leaves in the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. The pulmonary arteries are the only arteries in the body that carry deoxygenated blood. Blood returns from the lungs to the heart in the pulmonary veins. These are the only veins in the body that carry fresh, oxygenated blood. Blood leaves the heart from the left ventricle through the artery called the aorta. The aorta has several branches into other arteries that are carrying blood away from the heart and to the body tissues.
