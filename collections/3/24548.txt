Non-HDL cholesterol includes LDL cholesterol and is calculated by subtracting your HDL cholesterol levels from your total cholesterol levels. Your doctor may diagnose you with high blood cholesterol if your total or non-HDL level, which includes LDL cholesterol, is higher than what is considered to be healthy for your age, sex, and health status. Healthy blood cholesterol levels differ by age and sex.
