Bright orange-red, 1/2- to 1-in. berries have a slightly sweet, mildly tangy flavor. Berries can be eaten fresh, made into juice, wine or herbal tea, or dried and enjoyed as a snack similar to raisins. The Goji shrub will grow 8-10 ft. in full sun to partial shade, with emerald foliage on graceful, vine-like branches. Star-shaped blooms in shades of white, lilac and purple will appear in early summer, with fruit ripening in July. It will continue to fruit and flower until heavy frost.
