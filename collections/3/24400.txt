In the first few years (three to four years), there are no symptoms or infections and is known as 'asymptomatic phase'. Gradually, symptoms like recurring low-grade fever and diarrhoea, swelling in the lymph nodes, unexplained weight loss and skin infections start showing up (five to six years after infection).
