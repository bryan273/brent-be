This page provides an introduction to junctional rhythms and links to training materials on this website. The SA node is the normal origin of the electrical impulse for a heart beat. When the SA node cannot perform this role, the atrioventricular (AV) node may take-over pacemaking. When this occurs, the EKG will likely have distinctive waveform features that reveal important aspects of these junctional rhythms.
