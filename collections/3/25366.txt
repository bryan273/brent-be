If you dont poop, something in your large intestine called, villai, will absorb all the water in your poop, which is fine, but eventually, the poop runs out of water, and you start reabsorbing the things your body was trying to get rid of in the first place.At this point, it would be hard to poop if you tried) Then, after enough fecal matter is absorbed, you get sepsis. (Poopy infection) then septic shock, then death. Go poop when you have to.
