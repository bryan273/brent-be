I just got my first back to work job after two years staying at home with my daughter. What worked for me was listing full-time mother on my resume just like any other job. After all, raising a child is VERY hard work, and should be treated that way.ny gaps in employment can be explained in the cover letter. While the work one does as a stay at home Mom or Dad is important, it is not appropriate for a professional resume. As a Director of Employment, I am immediately uninterested in a resume that lists that experience.
