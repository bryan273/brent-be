The Visigoths settled along the north side of the Danube river, took up farming and trading with the Romans, and lived there more or less peacefully for several hundred years. Their name, Visigoths, means the Nearer Goths, because they lived closer to the Romans than the Ostrogoths did. Then in the 300s AD, like their cousins the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths began to be pushed southward by new invaders, the Huns.
