Also, the problems they can cause will vary by where the leak is located. A leak at the manifold between the manifold and the head will normally sound like a loud ticking sound. This kind of leak can create excess heat in the exhaust port, which can burn the exhaust valve-which will be an expensive repair. leak at the manifold between the manifold and the head will normally sound like a loud ticking sound.
