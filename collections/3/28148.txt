Eddy Barasch, M.D. Echocardiography is so sensitive that it can detect mild murmurs not otherwise heard, alerting your doctor to potential problems. Dr. Barasch is the Director of the Cardiac Echo Laboratories at the Hermann Heart Center and the University of Texas Medical School, Houston. Echocardiography is a modern technique that allows the physician to evaluate the heart without inserting any tubes or wires.
