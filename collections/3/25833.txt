There are a range of management techniques that MPA managers can use. These techniques can be broadly categorized into ways of prohibiting and limiting activity (Kenchington and Kelleher 1995): Prohibition: Absolute prohibition of access to a prescribed area is the simplest form of regulation. It is a form of control that establishes a clear yes/no basis â€“ if a person is found in the area, he has violated the regulation.
