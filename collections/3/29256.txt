Shoulder pain can come from a number of sources. The two main causes of shoulder pain include: Injury to muscles and/or tendons from prolonged overuse â€” for example, performing a repetitive activity like painting for too long. Muscles and/or tendons pinched between bones or ligaments, also known as impingement.
