Where is your LCL? The LCL ligament is found along the outside of the knee and connects the femur to the smaller bone of the leg bone (fibula). The LCL along with the MCL are both collateral ligaments meaning they are found along the sides of the knee. The LCL controls the side to side movement within the knee. Since the LCL does not connect to the meniscus or knee joint capsule, it is more flexible, and less vulnerable to knee injuries. An LCL injury is however very common in contact sports such as football and soccer.
