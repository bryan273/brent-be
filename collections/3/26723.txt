A thrombus, or colloquially a blood clot, is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis.There are two components to a thrombus: aggregated platelets that form a platelet plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein.The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor.A thrombus is a healthy response to injury intended to prevent bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when clots obstruct blood flow through healthy blood vessels. Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a blood vessel.he substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor.
