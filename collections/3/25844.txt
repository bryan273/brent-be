This should be the biggest part of your bunny's diet. Other than hay, most of the plants you give your pet bunny should be fresh, dark, leafy green vegetables. Non-leafy plants (vegetables, fruit) are fine as a treat, but too much will make your bunny sick. Rabbits can also eat flowers and twigs.lowers and many other plants, vegetables, fruits, etc. are only good as treats for rabbits. Rabbits should eat mostly hay, with some high-quality pellets daily, and some fresh dark leafy greens daily, and water.
