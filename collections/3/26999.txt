So far the easy part, first thing you should know about scripting is what a path is, a path is a piece of text that represents an object in your place. In a script your place is called 'Game', and the object that holds all present objects in your place is called 'Workspace'.cripting is what actually makes blocks in ROBLOX do things, and without it your character's limbs wouldn't move when you are walking and a rifle would just be a bunch of parts being held by your character. In short: scripting is what makes ROBLOX come to life and make places fun.
