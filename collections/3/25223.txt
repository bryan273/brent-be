And it seems Chrissy Teigen is ready to make the brown bulldog a star. The 28-year-old brought along her pooch to film an appearance on talk show Talk Stoop with host Cat Greenleaf on Monday in New York City. NBC's Emmy award-winning show, which films on Greenleaf's very own stoop in Brooklyn, is co-hosted by her adorable 13-year-old white bulldog, Gracie.
