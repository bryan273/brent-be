The Browns are not only the longest shot for the Super Bowl, they're also the only team with triple-figure odds -- and 200-1 at that. It's a fair assessment, after the Browns finished 3-13 and look to be starting over at QB again. Add in the lack of playmakers and a poor defense, and 2,000-1 odds wouldn't be crazy.
