While we're cruisin' around in the street. Listen up for the party in feet. So slap me five that's the place we've arrived it's alive. Everybody take it to the top we're gonna. Stomp all night. In the neighborhood don't it feel all right. Gonna stomp all night. Wanna party till morning light. Runnin' runnin' runnin'.
