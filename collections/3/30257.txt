Actor Michael Gill says it can be lonely playing the easily manipulated President Garrett Walker on Netflix's 'House of Cards.'. Kevin Spacey's House of Cards is all about Spacey's character Francis Underwood, the ruthless South Carolina congressman who claws his way to power. While Spacey is busy corrupting Capitol Hill on the show, he carves out time to visit 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and pull strings on the puppet President Garrett Walker, played by actor Michael Gill.
