Gonzales was established in 1825 on Kerr Creek, 2 1/2 miles east of the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers. It was the capital of Empresario Green DeWittâ€™s Colony and was the westernmost Anglo settlement until the close of the Texas Revolution. The town was named in honor of Don Rafael Gonzales, provisional Governor of Coahuila, Mexico and Texas.
