Easy: When you are ruled 100 percent disabled due to military service, the VA sends you a letter certifying your status. All you have to do is take that letter to a military pass and ID office and you'll be issued an ID card that grants you commissary privileges. You can use this site to help you make an appointment at your nearest ID card office.
