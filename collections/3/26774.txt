As I found out first hand, Glaucoma is a very serious eye disease that can be quite painful. Bunny Roo Beagle had Glaucoma and had to have her eye removed. Glaucoma develops when fluid in the eye is produced more quickly than it can be removed. As a result of this fluid build-up, a sustained increase in eye pressure develops which in turn can damage the optic nerve and retina.
