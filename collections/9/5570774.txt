School of Medicine, Family Medicine answered. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has symptoms that include irregularity in timing and consistency of bowel movements. There can be diarrhea, constipation or both associated with IBS. Fiber can help with these symptoms in several ways. Fiber helps to move the material through the GI tract, which helps with symptoms of constipation. Also, fiber is considered a bulking agent, which helps absorb water and decrease diarrhea.
