Take for granted that your period will be heavier and more painful. It will also last for more days than it used to last previously. The reason why the first period after delivery is painful, longer, and heavier is that the body is adapting to this change. It hasn’t gone through the cycle for nine months now and it is a little new for it. Soon your body will adjust and from your next period, you won’t face a problem.
