medically speaking, type 1 is worse, because the pancreas shuts down, whereas in type 2, the pancreas simply functions improperly. However, as a type 1 diabetic patient, I can tell you that Type 1 is BAD. through constant glucose checks and insulin injections, it is a lot to manage and sometimes quite a hassle.ype 2 diabetics have the problem of having insulin resistance. Yes, their pancreas's still produce insulin, but that does not mean that their body is receiving it. Like type 1's they also have to maintain a strict diet and exercise regularly, but their health is not completely up to them.
