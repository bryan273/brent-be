Diabetes can affect your skin. Lack of moisture can cause the skin on your feet to dry and crack. It is important to completely dry your feet after bathing or swimming. You can use petroleum jelly or gentle creams, but be careful: creams or oils left between your toes can become so moist that it can lead to infection.
