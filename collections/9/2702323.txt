When breast cancer spreads to the spine, it's known as bone metastasis. And unfortunately yes, breast cancer that has spread to the bones may spread to other areas such as the brain as well. This happens when cancer cells break away from the primary tumor and travel through the circulatory system. The most common areas for breast cancer to spread are the bones, lung, liver, and brain.
