Directions. 1  In a small saucepan, place prunes, water, and orange juice. 2  Bring to boil, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. 3  Prunes will absorb most of the water, and the remaining water will thicken into a consistency of syrup. 4  If there is a lot of liquid remaining, simmer, uncovered, for a few minutes until sauce reduces.
