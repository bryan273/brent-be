It has been a tough few weeks for Celine Dion, but she knows that the show must go on. On Wednesday night, Feb. 3, Celine will perform at her Las Vegas residency for the very first time since her husband, Rene, lost his battle with cancer on Jan. 14. This will also be the first performance since her brother, Daniel Dion, also died from cancer just a couple of days after Rene.
