Bradycardia is a very slow heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. It happens when the electrical impulse that signals the heart to contract is not formed in your heart's natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SA node), or is not sent to the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles) through the proper channels.
