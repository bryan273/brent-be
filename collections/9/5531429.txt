Yellow phlegm in particular can scream infection. But, interestingly enough, the color does not come from infection. A yellow hue to the mucus is caused from white blood cells, according to Health.com. So, yellow mucus therefore isnâ€™t a result of an infection, but a result of the body fighting an infection. Coughing up yellow mucus therefore can be associated with battling the illness as opposed to being a symptom.
