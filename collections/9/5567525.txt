Some have pain and heavy menstrual bleeding. Fibroids also can put pressure on the bladder, causing frequent urination, or the rectum, causing rectal pressure. Should the fibroids get very large, they can cause the abdomen (stomach area) to enlarge, making a woman look pregnant. If the fibroids are large, a woman may need a hysterectomy that involves cutting into the abdomen to remove the uterus. 2  If the fibroids are smaller, the doctor may be able to reach the uterus through the vagina, instead of making a cut in the abdomen. 3  In some cases hysterectomy can be performed through the laparoscope.
