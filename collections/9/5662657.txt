Muscle or nerve: Muscle 'pulls' or strains can be irritated when you stretch or use the muscle. Tight muscles can also pull on the local nerves causing burning with stretch. Other times, nerve irritation can cause burning when the leg is pulled. A physiatrist or doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation can help determine the cause and recommend treatment.
