This is a bit unusual as most women that experience bleeding after intercourse do so immediately instead of a few days later. Usually when women experience bleeding after sexual intercourse it is due to the breaking of small blood vessels at the end of the cervix. These blood vessels are quite fragile and often pop during intercourse.
