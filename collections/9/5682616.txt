I have been taking 150 mg every day for about a year, with minimal side effects only a little insomnia here and there. I started experiencing stomach pain and did not think at all that the Zantac could be causing it, so I upped the dosage to 300 mg. After 4 day's at this dose I experienced a tightness in my throat, sore throat, agitation, insomnia and anxiety. I missed a day of work I could not function.
