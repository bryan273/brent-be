Common Causes of COPD. Cigarette smoke is by far the most common reason people get COPD. You can also get it from tobacco products, such as cigar and pipe smoke, especially if you breathe in the smoke. Secondhand smoke is also an issue. Even if you arenâ€™t a smoker, you can get COPD from living with one.
