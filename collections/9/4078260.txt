Other factors also seem to contribute to ulcer formation. Overuse of over-the-counter painkillers (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen), heavy alcohol use, psychological stress, and smoking exacerbate and may promote the development of ulcers, especially in someone with H. pylori. Other studies show that stomach ulcers are more likely to develop in older people.
