leg pain that affects the front of the thigh or leg. Description. Femoral nerve root pain is generally seen in the patient over 50 years as degeneration in the lower spinal segments has taken its course and the upper lumbar segments are now doing much of the work of the spine. The L1, L2 and L3 nerves are likely being compressed, causing the pain down the front of the thigh or leg.
