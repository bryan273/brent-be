I had a rear molar worked on 2 weeks ago, and now I can't open my jaw enough to place anything larger that my pincky finger into it. Went to the oral surgeon yesterday, he told me I had trismus, caused by a spasm in my muscle of the jaw due to the needle from the novacain. His suggestion to increase how far my mouth will open, start with 7 tongue depressors, insert between my teeth, and add a new one everyday until I can get 27 in there.
