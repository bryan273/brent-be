What Is Optic Atrophy? The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that carry images from your retina to your brain. Each fiber carries a part of the visual information to the brain. If these nerve fibers become damaged, the brain doesn't receive all of this vision information and sight becomes blurred. Optic atrophy means the loss of some or most of the nerve fibers in the optic nerve. The effects range from visual change to severe visual loss.
