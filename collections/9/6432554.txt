Hiccups can occur for a variety of reasons. These include eating too much, swallowing air while chewing, or even being anxious or excited. These same triggers can cause babies to hiccup, which is not usually a problem for a healthy child. It’s easy for a baby to swallow some air while feeding, and extra air can increase the risk of hiccups. This is why it’s important to burp your baby to get the air out of their tummy. Air in the tummy can also make babies uncomfortable and may cause them to spit up.
