Narrow shoes can cause blisters on the big toe and little toe. A shallow toe box can lead to blisters on the tops of the toes, while loose shoes can create blisters on the tips of the toes. * When trying on shoes, be sure to wear the same socks, insoles, or orthotics that you wear when training or racing.
