There are two techniques used for aging beef: wet aging, and dry aging, and they result in very different flavors and textures. Most authorities on meat agree that dry aged beef has a superior flavor, and it is often found at fine dining establishments. Wet aged beef tends to be cheaper, and dominates the meat market: almost 90% of the beef sold commercially is wet aged. Both aging techniques are also designed to make meat more tender.
