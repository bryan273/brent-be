What are swollen gums? Gum swelling results from excess fluid (edema) in the soft tissues of the gums and may be accompanied by redness, pain, sores, ulcers and bleeding. Poor oral hygiene, resulting in inflammation or infection, is the most common cause of swollen gums. The symptoms may be constant or variable and may worsen when eating or drinking. If gum pain is present, it may be described as sharp, dull, stabbing, burning or throbbing, ranging in intensity from mild to severe. Depending on the cause, swollen gums may be present in only a small part of a gum (sore or ulcer), or at the gum line (gingivitis and periodontitis).
