Trapezius strain symptoms can manifest in sore and aching muscle pain which radiates from the shoulders to the back of the neck. The discomfort can also be felt in the upper part of the back, between the shoulder blades. Shoulder pain is most commonly felt at the start of a trapezius strain injury, and can be made worse through improper posture and repetitive motion.
