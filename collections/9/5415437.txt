Diagnosing many common causes of mouth ulcers, such as oral thrush, cold sores and canker sores, can often be made by the symptoms and the appearance of the mouth ulcers. Making a diagnosis of mouth ulcers may also include performing a variety of tests to help to diagnose potential underlying diseases, conditions or disorders, such as oral cancer and leukoplakia.
