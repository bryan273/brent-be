Any source of irritation or inflammation of the urinary tract, especially the bladder, prostate or urethra, can cause dysuria (Table 1) . Dysuria is often associated with other irritative voiding symptoms, such as urgency, frequency and nocturia, but its most common cause is urinary tract infection. Urinary stasis resulting from urethral obstruction makes BPH a very common predisposing factor for urinary tract infection.
