The fashion powers that be have had it too -- and they're now cramming sensible, comfortable sandals down everyone's throat. The very best example of the fugly shoe genre are the jeweled sandals by Marni above, and you can find similar styles at Kohl's, of all places! I snapped them up in every single color I could get my hands on, so I can personally vouch for their support and comfort.
