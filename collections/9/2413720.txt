Hemoglobin is the red pigmented, oxygen-carrying protein found in red blood cells. When hemoglobin is present in the urine, it is termed hemoglobinuria. Certain conditions and diseases can result in red blood cell destruction within the bloodstream.As the level of free hemoglobin rises, it becomes detectable in the urine. Laboratory analysis is used to confirm the presence of hemoglobinuria.he bacteria usually ascend from the genital area through the urinary tract to the kidneys. Sometimes the infection develops from a different infection somewhere else in the body.
