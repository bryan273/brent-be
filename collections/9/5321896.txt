Is there concrete evidence that stress is a trigger of rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions? Is stress a factor in disease activity for those conditions? If you have rheumatoid arthritis, it's both interesting and important to know if stress triggers the disease or if stress worsens the symptoms. Either way, it is to your benefit to eliminate as much stress from your life as possible. With stress that cannot be eliminated, it must be well-managed.
