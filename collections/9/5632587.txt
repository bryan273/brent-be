Step 1. Drain the water in the pool by at least 6 to 10 inches so that you can easily access the calcium-stained areas. This also allows you to wipe the loosened calcium off without depositing it into the pool water. Step 2. Kneel down on the edge of the pool, or get into the pool if you don't mind getting wet. Place a stiff-bristled tile brush on top of the calcium deposits and scrub the pool tiles using circular motions to loosen the deposits. Step 3. Wipe the pool tile with a cloth or a paper towel to remove the loosened calcium.
