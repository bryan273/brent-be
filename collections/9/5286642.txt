By Dr Ananya Mandal, MD. The term vomiting describes the forceful expulsion of the contents of the stomach via the mouth or sometimes the nose, also known of as emesis.The causes of vomiting are as wide ranging as those for nausea and include anything from food poisoning or gastritis to head injuries and brain cancer.egurgitation is a different condition from vomiting and the term regurgitation usually means expulsion of the undigested food from the food pipe or esophagus into the mouth, with none of the forceful expulsion or discomfort that is associated with nausea.
