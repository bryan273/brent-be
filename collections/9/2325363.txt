Examples of non-benzodiazepine sleep aids are zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon. Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for sleep difficulties because, through altering chemicals such as serotonin and norepinephrine, they can have a sedating effect. Trazodone and amitriptyline are antidepressants that are sometimes prescribed as sleep aids. Diphenhydramine is an over-the-counter sleep aid.
