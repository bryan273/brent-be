Oils and grains: Healthy fats, such as extra virgin olive oil and safflower oil, are better alternatives to trans fats. Fiber is a necessary part of the hiatal hernia diet, so be sure to include plenty of whole grains in your meals. Brown rice, whole-grain pasta, rye bread, and quinoa are all excellent options. If you prefer, substitute these options with gluten-free alternatives.
