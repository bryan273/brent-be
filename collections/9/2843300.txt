hemoglobin (hēˈməglōˌbĭn) [ key ], respiratory protein found in the red blood cells (erythrocytes) of all vertebrates and some invertebrates. A hemoglobin molecule is composed of a protein group, known as globin, and four heme groups, each associated with an iron atom.In the lungs, each iron atom combines reversibly with a molecule of oxygen. Each hemoglobin molecule also has attached a single cysteine amino acid, which attracts nitric oxide from the lungs. hemoglobin molecule is composed of a protein group, known as globin, and four heme groups, each associated with an iron atom.
