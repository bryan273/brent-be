Occasionally a special probe is used, such as with a vaginal ultrasound or a gastroscopy (stomach/gut scan). These probes are used to target the sound waves to a specific area. Ultrasounds are commonly used during pregnancy to assess the growth and development of the baby. But they are also used for other, routine medical assessments as well. Areas such as the abdomen, pelvis, muscles, joints and event the heart and blood vessels can all be visualised through ultrasound.
