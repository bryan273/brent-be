Capsaicin cream. If you have osteoarthritis in your hands or knees and topical NSAIDs have not been effective in easing your pain, your GP may prescribe capsaicin cream. Capsaicin cream works by blocking the nerves that send pain messages in the treated area. You may have to use it for a while before it has an effect.
