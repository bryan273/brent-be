Symptoms are related to the effects of excess thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones control metabolism, so excessive amounts of T4 or T3 cause a metabolic rate that is too high. This is called a hyper-metabolic state. People with hyperthyroidism typically have rapid heart rates, weight loss, and heat intolerance. The thyroid gland can be visibly enlarged (goiter). You can also have elevated blood pressure, nervousness, and hand tremors. You may also sweat a lot, feel hungry and restless, and have difficulty concentrating.
