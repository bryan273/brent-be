NT MoM: First Trimester Screening screens for Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 only. Neural tube defect screening needs to be performed in the second trimester using Maternal Serum AFP (test code 5059), ideally. This is best performed at 16-18 weeks gestation. This is a screening test, not a diagnostic test.
