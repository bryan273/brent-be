Steps to Take to Make Scabs Heal Faster. 1  Allow a scab to heal naturally and undisturbed. Picking at, itching and removing scabs will make a sore worse. 2  Prevent the scab from cracking. Scabs heal better when they are kept moist with lotions or creams. 3  Protect the scab from bumps and scrapes. Scabs heal faster when they are protected from being banged up and scratched. Scabs that are in an area that is susceptible to bumps and used frequently—such as elbows, calves, fingers and toes—should be covered loosely with gauze.
