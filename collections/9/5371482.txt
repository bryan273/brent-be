Report Abuse. A cough is a reflex when we're ill. This is going to sound pretty disgusting but extra mucus is produced during illness to catch any bacteria and stop more of whatever's made you ill from entering your body, and you cough it back up regularly to stop the mucus from entering your lungs and choking you.
