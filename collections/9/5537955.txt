The middle ear is an air-filled cavity that sits between the tympanic membrane (3) and the inner ear. The middle ear consists of the tympanic membrane (3), three tiny bones called ossicles (4), the round window (5), the oval window (6), and the Eustachian tube (7).The tympanic membrane is a very thin structure that separates the external ear canal from the middle ear space.he inner ear consists of three parts: the vestibule (9), the cochlea (10), and the semicircular canals (11). The vestibule is the central inner ear cavity, the cochlea is the organ of hearing, and the semicircular canals are part of the balance system.
