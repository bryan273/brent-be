Urinary tract infections are caused when microbes manage to get past the body's natural defenses. The vast majority of UTI cases are caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), usually found in the digestive system. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma bacteria can infect the urethra but not the bladder. People of any age and sex can develop a UTI; however, some people are more at risk than others.
