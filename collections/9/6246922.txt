Leukemia is the most common form of cancer in childhood. It affects approximately 3,000 children each year in the US, accounting for about 30 percent of childhood cancers. Leukemia can occur at any age, although it is most commonly seen in children between 2 and 6 years of age.The disease occurs slightly more frequently in males than in females, and is more commonly seen in Caucasian children than in African-American children, or children of other races. With acute lymphocytic leukemia, the bone marrow makes too many of these lymphocytes and they do not mature correctly. 2  The lymphocytes overproduce, thus, crowding out other blood cells. 3  Immature blood cells (blasts) do not work properly to fight infection. 4  Acute leukemia can occur over a short period of days to weeks.
