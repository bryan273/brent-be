Medications for Obsessive-compulsive Disorder. 1  The modern era in the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) began in the late 1960s with the observation that clomipramine, not other tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil), was effective in treating OCD. Clomipramine is the most thoroughly studied drug for OCD and was the first to receive FDA approval for this indication. Like other tricyclic antidepressants, side effects of dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention are common. Like other SRIs, nausea and tremor also are common with clomipramine.
