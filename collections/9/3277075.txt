According to the American Cancer Society, the risk of developing endometrial cancer from tamoxifen is about 1 in 500 â€” a small risk, but higher than that for women in the general population. Tamoxifen also slightly increases the risk of uterine sarcoma, a cancer that begins in the muscle of the uterine wall.
