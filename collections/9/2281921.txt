Drink clear liquids. With nausea often comes vomiting, and vomiting can cause dehydration. If your body is dehydrated, it will take longer to heal and you will feel the effects of nausea stronger than usual. Drink 2-4 ounces of water every 15 minutes while you are awake to try to keep hydrated. If you drink sugary fluids it may cause a reaction in your stomach and make the pain worse and last longer. 2  If you have gas just let it out. 3  Don't hold it in, since that just makes it worse. 4  Try to sleep, but not on your back in case you vomit in your sleep, it is better to be on your side so you don't choke.
