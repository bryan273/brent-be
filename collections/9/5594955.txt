Some B type blood have allergic reactions to soy and bloat. I am one of them. Not all soy products are pure and may contain other products within them that your body may react to. Have a food allergy test done (a good one). Wheat flavoring products though natural have allergic reactions such as bloating (inflammation). There are many who are just allergic to soy and bloating is one of the symptoms. Stop it for a while (at least 3 months) and see how you feel.
