RSV is another virus that causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract. RSV is so common that most children have been infected by the age of two. For the majority of those affected, RSV causes only mild cold-like symptoms but it is also the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children under the age of one.
