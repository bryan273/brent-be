How Does the Optic Nerve Function? The optic nerve may be found in your eye, but it is part of the central nervous system. The optic nerve takes visual information gathered from your eye and transmits it using a series of electrical impulses to the parts of your brain that act as vision centers, allowing you to make sense of what you are seeing.
