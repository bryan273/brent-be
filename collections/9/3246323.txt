Blood in the urine is called hematuria. Hematuria can be identified by the presence of pink, red, brown or black urine or by the microscopic presence of blood cells. A urinalysis is used to help determine if the blood is from urinary tract disease or the result of a condition affecting coagulation or bleeding.
