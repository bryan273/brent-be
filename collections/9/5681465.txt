Allrecipes says: * Most bread is baked in a moderate oven, 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bottom of a loaf sounds hollow when tapped.our bread machine recipe might be different from a regular bread recipe. When baking, I usually preheat my oven to 250C with a deep pan at the bottom rack with a few cups of water. This is important to keep the dough moist but give a good crust. When it comes time to bake, I pop mu loaf in and drop the temp to 200C.
