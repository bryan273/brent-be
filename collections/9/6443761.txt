COPD exacerbation. Many people with COPD have attacks called flare-ups or exacerbations (say egg-ZASS-er-BAY-shuns). This is when your usual symptoms quickly get worse and stay worse. A COPD flare-up can be dangerous, and you may have to go to the hospital. Symptoms include: Coughing up more mucus than usual. A change in the color or thickness of that mucus. More shortness of breath than usual. Greater tightness in your chest.
