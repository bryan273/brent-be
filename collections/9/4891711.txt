A stroke is sometimes called a brain attack.. A seizure is the physical findings or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. First seizures, febrile seizures, nonepileptic events, and eclampsia are examples of seizures that may not be associated with epilepsy.
