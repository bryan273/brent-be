Spread to Bone. Roughly 30 to 40 percent of people with advanced lung cancer have spread (metastases) to bones. The most common bones to be affected are the spine (especially the vertebrae in the chest and lower abdominal area), the pelvis, and the upper bones of the arms and legs (humerus and femur).
