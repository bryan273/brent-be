For dogs who just have diarrhea: 1  Make sure the dog has access to plenty of clean water to avoid dehydration. Encourage the dog to drink. 2  Give the dog a small meal of boiled white meat chicken (no bones or skin) and white rice. This can be the dog's diet until the stool consistency returns to normal. If the diarrhea continues for more than 24 hours or your dogâ€™s condition worsens at any time, call your vet immediately.
