The classic symptoms of appendicitis include: Dull pain near the navel or the upper or lower abdomen that becomes sharp as it moves to the lower right abdomen; this is usually the first sign, but it occurs in less than half of appendicitis cases. Loss of appetite. Nausea or vomiting soon after abdominal pain begins. Abdominal swelling.
