The relationship between the genes and the characters can be summarized as: Genome to phenome concept. It is evident that cells use RNA to make proteins. Hence gene expression involves two steps: transcription (RNA making) and translation (Protein making). In the first step (transcription) the coded message present in the DNA as the nucleotide sequence is passed on to the mDNA (messenger RNA).
