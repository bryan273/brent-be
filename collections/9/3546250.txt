Be careful not to rub soap into the skin; it can clog pores. If your oily skin is scaly, you can often correct the problem by using a deep-cleaning exfoliant on alternate nights, and following the treatment with a light coating of moisturizer. Try using a clay or mud mask. If you have sensitive skin, use white or rose-colored clays.
