The best tests for diagnosing COPD and seeing how well it responds to treatment are pulmonary function tests. The gold-standard test for patients with respiratory symptoms is spirometry. Spirometry measures the volume and force of air as it is exhaled from the lungs. It measures airway obstruction, can identify COPD early, and the results are standardized so they are always consistent.
