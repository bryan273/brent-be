The Dreaded Strep. Strep throat is an infection caused by bacteria. Symptoms can include throat pain, white patches on your tonsils, swollen lymph nodes in your neck, and fever. When you have strep throat, you usually donâ€™t have a runny nose or cough. Anyone can get strep throat, but children between the ages of 5 and 15 tend to get it most often.
