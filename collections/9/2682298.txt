Friction can happen when the thighs rub together. The friction results in irritation of the skin of the inner thighs, leading to bumps on inner thighs. The irritation can cause a heat rash called miliara. Irritated skin often leads to blockage of the sweat glands and the formation of pink, red or white bumps. Common symptoms are itching or a prickly feeling in thighs.
