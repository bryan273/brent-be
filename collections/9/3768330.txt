At the cvs pharmacy the flu was free and the tdap was gonna be the $75 or whatever for my fianc\351. But at the minute clinic, in the same store, literally 5 feet away, they were both free! If he has had a tetanus shot within the last 7 years he would have gotten the tdap vaccine then. And you only need it every 10 years or if it's been more than 5 years and you get cut by something that could have tetanus. If he's due for a physical and has insurance he can get it then and should be covered.
