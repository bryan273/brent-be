A normal, full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks, and can range from 37-42 weeks. Itâ€™s divided into three trimesters. Each trimester lasts between 12 and 14 weeks, or about three months. Each trimester comes with its own specific hormonal and physiological changes. Being aware of the ways that your growing baby is affecting your body will help you to better prepare yourself for these changes as they happen.
