About six times every day, someone in the USA dies of alcohol poisoning after drinking too much in a single binge, a new report says. The report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an estimated 2,221 people older than 15 died of alcohol poisoning each year from 2010 to 2012. About 76% were men and nearly 77% were ages 35 to 64.
