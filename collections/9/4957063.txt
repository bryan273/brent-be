The pain in the leg or foot is often worse than the pain in the back. The irritation or pressure on the nerve may also cause pins and needles, numbness or weakness in part of a buttock, leg or foot. About 9 in 10 cases of nerve root back pain are due to a prolapsed disc - often called a slipped disc.
