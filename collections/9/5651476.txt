You can do a home pregnancy test about 14 days after having sex. Or alternatively, you can see your doctor for a Quantitative Beta HCG blood pregnancy test 7 days after intercourse. Good luck and hope you get the result you want. I don't know how long after intercourse that you have to wait, but I do know that EPT will let you take a pregnancy test before you start your period.
