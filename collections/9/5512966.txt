Metabolic acidosis also promotes urinary calcium and phosphate excretion to counteract an increase in the circulating acid load produced by the catabolism of protein [15, 16]. Metabolism of protein in the body is known to differ between exercising participants and non-exercising participants [17, 18]. However, limited athlete-specific research on the effects of excessive dietary protein on metabolic homeostasis exists, even in groups of resistance exercisers.
