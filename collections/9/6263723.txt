Color blindness is most often a genetic disorder, but it can be acquired due to illness, eye/brain/nerve damage, or chemicals. People with this condition tend to see a limited â€¦ range of colors; a rare few may not see colors at all.The eye is very much like a film camera.he most common form is red-green color blindness, also called Deuteranopia. In my opinion, this is a very hard question to answer because you are asking what someone perceives, which can be caused both by the cones in your eyes as well as the brain.
