This pressure is typically set slightly higher than atmospheric pressure to prevent atelectasis, decrease inspiratory work of breathing, or improve gas exchange depending on the clinical scenario. This positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is generated by a resistor in the exhalation port of the ventilator (Fig. 2).
