If your diet isn’t high enough in fiber, you may find that you have slower digestion. This problem can be remedied by eating more plant foods and by taking a fiber supplement if necessary. Not drinking enough water can also be one of the causes of constipation in women. Water helps the body to remain hydrated so that the digestive system can run smoothly. If you don’t take in enough water, you may find that your stools become hard and difficult to pass.
