Yes there should be more P.E classes at school. We need more P.E classes because its more fun then learning and sitting in your chair like a nerd and you can get up and do something physical. Many students dont do excersise at home and once a week is not sufficien.e shouldn't have more P.E at school. P.E classes are just waste of time. Children fight each other that our team won or my team won. Children should study, not argue with friends.My younger sister always had P.E classes which lead to a bad situation.
