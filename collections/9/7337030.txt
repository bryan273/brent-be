Clarithromycin is another antibiotic treatment for walking pneumonia. It is more powerful than even erythromycin as it is also used to help treat HIV/AIDS patients. It works by interfering with the protein synthesis of bacteria, which prevents them from growing further. It is given in the form of tablets or a gel.
