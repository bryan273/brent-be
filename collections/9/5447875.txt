Astigmatism in only one eye may cause lazy eye (amblyopia) if present from birth. The affected eye does not 'learn' how to see because the brain ignores the signals it receives. Amblyopia can be treated with eye patching if diagnosed early enough, before the vision pathways in the brain are fully developed.
