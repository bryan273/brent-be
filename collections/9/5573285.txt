A. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the chicken pox virus. Once you have had chicken pox, the virus remains dormant in your body. When this virus reawakens, it causes a blistering rash called shingles. If shingles affects the trigeminal nerve on the face, it can cause sores to appear on one side of the mouth, tongue and palate. Other viruses, including herpes can also cause blisters around the mouth.
