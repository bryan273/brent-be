Herniated Discs and Headaches. Many patients who suffer cervical disc injuries often report getting headaches, particularly if their conditions merit invasive procedures such as epidural blocks and neurosurgery. In some cases, the headache symptoms mirror those of migraines, but this may not always be the case. When headaches are believed to be caused by neck pain, they are known as cervicogenic. This is especially the case with patients whose herniated discs are located at the C1-C3 spaces.
