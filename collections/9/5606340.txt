Shaky hands also could be due to anxiety, but to reach this diagnosis, a physician must first rule out physical causes. In addition to essential tremor and Parkinson’s, shaky hands may be caused by thyroid disease, drug side effects or heavy metal poisoning. Sometimes the nature of symptoms suggests the diagnosis. For example, essential tremor usually is seen when you are using your hands, while the tremor associated with Parkinson’s typically occurs when your hands are at rest. Treatment will depend on your diagnosis. In addition to beta blockers, a number of drugs are used to treat essential tremor. They include anti-seizure medications, tranquilizers, drugs used to treat glaucoma, and Botox. If no physical cause is found, your physician may attribute your shaky hands to anxiety.
