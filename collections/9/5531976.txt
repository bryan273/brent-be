T that T = 2π. q. m. k . Using this formula, we were able to. calculate the theoretical period of our simple harmonic oscillator. From the above formula, it can be seen that the mass of the oscillating object does have an eﬀect. on the period of oscillation. The greater the mass, the greater the period of oscillation will be, and. the slower the cart’s oscillation.
