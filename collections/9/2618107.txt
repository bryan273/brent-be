Movies Made Here. Motion pictures from the silent era to the 21st Century have shot on location in Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown. See if you can spot locations from your favorite flick. Before you ask, Tim Burtonâ€™s 1999 film Sleepy Hollow was shot in England. Sorry . . . no Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and no covered bridge.
