It was often joked that Carol Wayne would never drown with those large breasts of hers-but ironically that's exactly how she did die. To this day, the exact circumstances leading up to her death in 1985 remain a mystery. Carol Wayne's troubles started in 1980 when Johnny Carson threatened to quit his lucrative role as host of the popular 'Tonight' show. He demanded that NBC cut the show from ninety-minutes to sixty.
