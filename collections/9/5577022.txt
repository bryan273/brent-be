Many are silly and even dangerous, but every so often a fad appears that actually makes sense. Adding lemon juice to your drinking water is a good idea if you are trying to lose weight. Studies like the one done in 2008 at the Sugiyama Jogakuen University in Japan suggest that the polyphenols in lemons aid in weight loss. While a lemon juice diet alone is not recommended, drinking lemon water alone or with meals is an excellent way to stay hydrated.
