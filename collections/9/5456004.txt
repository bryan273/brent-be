Cutting. Genes can be cut out from the DNA of an organism and pasted into a new position in that organism or into the DNA of a different organism. This cutting and pasting process is called gene splicing.acterial restriction enzymes will work on DNA from other organisms because DNA is chemically identical, whether it comes from bacteria, a rose or a human. The chemicals in DNA are always the same; it's just the arrangement of the bases that varies. Different restriction enzymes cut at different sites.
