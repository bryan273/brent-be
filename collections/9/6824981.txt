Your neck is flexible and supports the weight of your head, so it can be vulnerable to injuries and conditions that cause pain and restrict motion. Neck pain causes include: 1  Muscle strains. 2  Overuse, such as too many hours hunched over your computer or smartphone, often triggers muscle strains.3  Even minor things, such as reading in bed or gritting your teeth, can strain neck muscles. 4  Worn joints. Your body then forms bone spurs that affect joint motion and cause pain. 2  Nerve compression. 3  Herniated disks or bone spurs in the vertebrae of your neck can press on the nerves branching out from the spinal cord. 4  Injuries.
