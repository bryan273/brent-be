When you breathe in the waste products of dust mites, your immune system kicks into high gear, producing antibodies against the normally harmless substances. This overzealous immune response causes the symptoms associated with a dust mite allergy, such as sneezing and runny nose. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), this type of allergy affects about 20 million people in the United States.
