Salmon patches (also called stork bites, angel kisses, or macular stains) are the most common type of birthmark. They are thin, flat, light pink or red areas of colored skin that occur most frequently on the back of the neck (stork bites) and on a baby's upper eyelids, upper lip, or between the eyebrows (angel kisses).
