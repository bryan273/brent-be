Before Your Blood Test. Your provider should let you know whether you need to fast prior to having your blood drawn. If youâ€™re not sure, confirm any requirements with your provider beforehand. Fasting for a blood test entails avoiding all food and beverages (except for water) for 8 to 12 hours prior to the test.
