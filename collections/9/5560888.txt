When a level of 0.3 ppm is reached, a good pool shocking is indicated. Shocking the pool to a level that is 100x greater than your chloramine is effective at chloramine removal. For a level at 0.3 ppm CAC, add enough chlorine to reach a level of 30 ppm in the pool. Chlorine is a great algaecide, I like to say.
