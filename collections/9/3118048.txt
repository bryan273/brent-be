The Powertech 2.5L four-cylinder returned in the Jeep TJ, carrying its 1984 AMC heritage though with horsepower tweaked up slightly. The 4.0L of previous Jeeps returned to the TJ with its Mopar engine management system. Fuel economy for the best rendition of the TJ 4.0L I6 is 15 city/18 highway MPG. The AMC 2.5L engine was replaced in the Jeep TJ with the Mopar 2.4L engine in 2004. This engine was originally developed for release in 1994 Chrysler small van and car products. This aluminum head, DOHC engine features a different bellhousing bolt pattern than the previous 2.5L.
