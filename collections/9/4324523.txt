Eczema and psoriasis are two conditions that are often confused for each other, but are very different. Eczema, also known as dermatitis, is a group of conditions in which the skin is hot, dry, itchy and scaly. In severe outbreaks, the skin may become raw, red and bleed. Eczema is thought to be a reaction to environmental irritants or allergies, and symptoms are worsened by stress and hormonal fluctuations. Psoriasis is a different inflammatory skin condition. It is marked by patches of raised reddish skin, covered with a whitish silver layer.
