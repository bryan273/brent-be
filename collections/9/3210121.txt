A common rule of thumb for recessions is two quarters of negative GDP growth. On the other hand, a depression is a prolonged period of economic recession marked by a significant decline in income and employment. Depressions are caused by the same factors that lead to a recession. Notice I used the words 'significant decline' and didn't give an amount of time.
