How about a simple list of 10 foods to eat for healthy eyes? Whole Grains. Whole Grains are good for your eyes, because they have a low glycemic index as opposed to other common types of carbs (white rice, pasta, processed bread). Eat foods like quinoa, brown rice and whole wheat and oats to protect your eyes. Whole grains also contain Vitamin E, Zinc and Niacin. Fish. Fish are one of the best foods for eye health, because they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These acids help protect against dry eyes, cataracts, AMD and more. They are also lower in fat than most other meat, which is always a dieting plus!
