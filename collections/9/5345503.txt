What are the risks of taking turmeric or curcumin? If you want to try turmeric or curcumin for stomach or gastrointestinal issues, moderation is your best bet. Large doses over long periods of time can cause diarrhea, stomach upset, and irritation. It also can interfere with medications that reduce stomach acid. If you have gallstones or obstructions of your bile passages, check with your doctor before trying turmeric, the NIH warns.
