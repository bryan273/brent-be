A black tea bag is another good home remedy for an abscessed tooth. It has tannins that help reduce pain and inflammation. In addition, it contains antioxidants that help fight infection and promote good oral health. Soak a black tea bag in warm water for a few minutes. Remove it from the water, wring it out and put the tea bag on the affected tooth. Leave it there for few hours or overnight. Rinse your mouth with a warm salt-water solution. Repeat once daily for a couple of weeks.
