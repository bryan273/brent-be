Bodybuilders are the quintessential muscle builders. If you consume 3,000 calories daily, this means you should aim for between 1,650 and 1,800 daily calories of carbohydrates -- equal to 412 to 450 grams. To determine how many carbs to eat at each meal, take the total carbs needed per day and divide by the number of meals you eat -- usually four or five. For example, if you need 450 grams of carbohydrates daily and have five meals, each meal should have about 90 grams of carbohydrates.
