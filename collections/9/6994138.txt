Heartburn Causes. The cause of heartburn is excessive flow of gastric contents back into the esophagus. Normally, there is an occasional backflow into the esophagus with no symptoms. The acidic gastric contents, when present in large amounts, irritate the esophagus (usually the lower part) and cause the symptoms of heartburn.
