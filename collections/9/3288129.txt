Bug-types Hoopa-Unbound faces similar problems, except it has a 4x weakness to Bug-types. This makes it vulnerable to U-turn and Bug-types in general (one such example is Scizor). Fairy-types Hoopa-Unbound also has a 2x weakness to Fairy-types, which is especially bad because of the rise of Fairy-types.
