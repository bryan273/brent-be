Fill a pot with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat. Place the carrots in the boiling water. The water must cover the carrots completely, so add more water if the carrots arenâ€™t completely submerged. Boil the carrots until they are tender. A pound of carrots requires approximately 10 to 15 minutes of boiling time to cook through.
