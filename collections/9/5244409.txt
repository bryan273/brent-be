Best & worst foods for swollen legs. Swollen legs are extremely common, in fact there is even a slang term for that: “cankles” . “Cankles” are calves joining knees with ankles without any change in leg size.

The causes of swollen legs usually lie in lymphatic and venous stasis, which, in turn, are due to chronic imbalance between body water and minerals.
