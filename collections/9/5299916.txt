Making the world better, one answer at a time. Crickets lay eggs. After mating, the cricket will take about 4-7 days to nest and then lay their eggs. The eggs need to be incubated in the nest about 2-3'' deep.This means you must give them enough nesting material to create it this far down.orses give birth after about (give or take) 11 months. The average birth takes about 2 hours from star â€¦ t to finish and the mare will deliver a 100lb foal (give or take) that will stand within the hour and nurse.
