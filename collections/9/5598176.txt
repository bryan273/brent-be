Effects of lead on animals. Lead affects the central nervous system of animals and inhibits their ability to synthesize red blood cells. Lead blood concentrations of above 40 g/dl can produce observable clinical symptoms in domestic animals. Calcium and phosphorus can reduce the intestinal absorption of lead (US EPA 1986).
