While thrush is considered a non-communicable disease, kissing can technically spread the yeast from the kisser’s (your) mouth to the kissee’s (your mate) mouth. This does not necessarily mean that the kissee will develop a yeast infection because thrush is an opportunistic infection.ymptoms of an oral yeast infection can include: 1  White patches on the tongue and insides of the cheeks. 2  Creamy, cottage cheese-like sores, also on the tongue and in the mouth.
