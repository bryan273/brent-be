Common causes of foot pain can vary, depending on whether the pain has just occurred or if it is a persistent, regularly occurring pain. Wearing improper shoes that pinch the toes or do not properly support the arch can be a leading cause of pain in the feet, as well as actual injuries such as bruises, muscle strains, or fractures.
