A Honor Society of Nursing (STTI) answered. Hiatal hernia symptoms can vary from mild heartburn to acid reflux disease. Symptoms may be worse after a large meal or bending forward. Common symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, frequent belching, bad breath, dry cough, nausea, and difficulty swallowing. In severe cases, a portion of the stomach can become incarcerated (trapped) after poking through the diaphragm or hiatus. An incarcerated hernia requires immediate medical attention.
