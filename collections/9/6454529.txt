Heart surgery patients in America pay 83% more for heart-bypass surgery than Canadians. This has verified the latest market study of Archives of Internal Medicine. The main reasons are higher medicine and labor costs. Researchers compared the results and costs of treating 12,017 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery at five U.S. hospitals and four in Canada. The average bypass-procedure cost was $20,673 in the U.S. and $10,373 in Canada, before adjustments.
