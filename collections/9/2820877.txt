Puberty is a major change that happens in your body. It is a time when you grow very fast and your body changes into an adult body. Puberty usually starts between ages 10 to 14 in boys, but it may start earlier or later. You may not go through puberty at the same time or in the same way as friends your age do. Puberty usually ends by about age 15 or 16 in boys.
