Cough. Increase text size / Decrease text size | Print this page | Email this page. You may experience a persistent cough or wheezing (a whistling sound in the lungs or laboured breathing) due to your heart failure. The wheezing is similar to asthma but has a different cause in heart failure. Sometimes people with heart failure cough up phlegm, a thick, mucous-like substance that may be tinged with blood. This often happens with a lung infection (pneumonia). The coughing or wheezing is due to the fluid accumulation or congestion, in the lungs, which increases the effort of breathing.
