As 40g Net Carbs has been scientifically validated as an acceptable level for the body to begin burning fat as fuel (i.e. ketosis), most individuals will still be able to lose weight at a healthy pace following Atkins 40. Carbs and fat are your body's two sources of fuel. A low-fat diet is high in carbs, so when you eat more carbs than your body needs, it stores them as fat. Atkins is an effective diet that transforms your metabolism from one that stores fat into one that burns fat.
