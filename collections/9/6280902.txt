Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD; Peripheral Artery Disease [PAD]). Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a problem with poor blood flow. It affects blood vessels outside of the heart and brain and gets worse over time.Parts of the body, like the brain, heart, arms, or legs, may not get enough blood.The legs and feet are most commonly affected.VD is often found in people with problems with the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary artery disease). That is because atherosclerosis, which causes coronary artery disease, affects arteries throughout the body. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque on the walls of the arteries.
