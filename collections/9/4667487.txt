Fungus can create chemicals that literally make us hungry. In other words, there’s a plethora of reasons why we could be hungry all the time, even if we need no more food. When I feel like i'm always hungry, I know that I’ve probably either consumed too little water, or too many tainted foods for too long.he more often I ate, the more hungry I became. Merely having to think about food all the time and planning my snack meals made me hungry. Plus, no single meal ever satisfied my hunger. It was like always eating an appetizer.
