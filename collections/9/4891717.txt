A stroke and a seizure are both serious and affect your brain activity. The causes and effects they have on your brain health are different, however. A stroke occurs due to a disruption of blood circulation in the brain, while a seizure occurs due to a surge of electrical activity in the brain. In addition, a stroke can permanently affect your thinking and muscle control.
