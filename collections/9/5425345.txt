TIC_TOC. MATLAB Functions for Elapsed Time. TIC_TOC is a directory of MATLAB programs which consider the MATLAB tic and toc functions for computing elapsed time. MATLAB includes two functions tic and TOC. If TIC is called before something is to be timed, and TOC is called afterward, then TOC will either print the elapsed wallclock time if its value is not being copied to a variable, or return the value of the elapsed wallclock time to a variable.
