Structural changes due to genetic conditions such as tuberous sclerosis, or neurofibromatosis, which can cause growths affecting the brain. Tuberous sclerosis – a genetic condition that causes growths in organs including the brain. Tuberous sclerosis can cause epilepsy. Neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow on the covering of nerves. Neurofibromatosis can cause epilepsy. Some researchers now believe that the chance of developing epilepsy is probably always genetic to some extent, in that any person who starts having seizures has always had some level of genetic likelihood to do so. This level can range from high to low and anywhere in between.
