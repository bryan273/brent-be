In primary hyperparathyroidism, the elevated levels of PTH cause elevated levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia). Increased calcium and phosphorus excretion in the urine may cause kidney stones. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a benign tumor called an adenoma on one of the parathyroid glands that secretes too much PTH. In other cases, the excess PTH is produced by two or more enlarged parathyroid glands, a condition called hyperplasia.
