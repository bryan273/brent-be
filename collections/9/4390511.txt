Itching in the nose, together with an increase in the amount of nasal mucus, are both signs that you have some inflammation inside they nose. There are at least two common causes of this. The first would be a common viral infection, such as the common cold. This may begin with itching and increased mucus in the early days of the infection prior to progressing to a full blown cold with nasal congestion, cough, and other symptoms.
