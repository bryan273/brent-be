A mixture of baking soda and castor oil has been used to remove skin tags at home. Mix the baking soda into a thick paste and apply it on to a clean skin tag. Cover the area with a band and leave it overnight. In the morning remove the band and clean the skin tag with warm water. Repeat the procedure for a week or 10 days until the lesion falls off.
