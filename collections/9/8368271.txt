Allergies affect millions of people in the United States. Besides a sore throat, they commonly cause fatigue, a runny nose, post-nasal drip and itchy eyes and ears. Allergies are caused by many things, including pollen, grass, mold, dust and pet dander. Allergies are often treated by a class of medications called antihistamines.
