Secondary education is divided into basic secondary education and pre-university secondary education. At the end of basic secondary education, pupils can choose between pre-university education and technical and professional education. Those who complete pre-university education are awarded the Bachillerato. Technical training leads to two levels of qualification-skilled worker and middle-level technician.
