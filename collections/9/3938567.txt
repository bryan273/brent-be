Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee might cause heartburn by encouraging acid production. Other caffeinated drinks, citrus fruit juices, tomato juice and carbonated beverages might trigger your heartburn. Citrus fruit juices include orange, grapefruit, lemon and pineapple. In some cases, these drinks might not cause symptoms because triggers depend on each person.
