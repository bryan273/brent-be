The devil’s in the details. Everyone’s blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day—thus evaluating it is like shooting at a moving target. Complex bodily systems (including the heart, arteries, nerves, hormones and kidneys) regulate and affect blood pressure. It can fluctuate from minute to minute, rising when you’re active, for instance, and typically dropping when you rest or sleep. Just standing up can cause pressure to rise—or fall.
