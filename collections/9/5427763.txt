Arterial Ulcers Arterial ulcers, also referred to as lower extremity ulcers, typically occur in patients who are suffering from artery disease. This type of skin ulcer is typically located on the feet, toes and toenails, where the poorly functioning arteries have trouble circulating blood properly. The base of an arterial ulcer has a brown, yellow, black or gray color, while the surrounding skin often looks red and swollen. Arterial skin ulcers are usually painful, and the pain can be far worse at night.
