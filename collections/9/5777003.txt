Flatulence in women is common. A womanâ€™s body goes through a series of hormonal changes throughout her life which affects the normal digestive process. As flatulence is a result of the accumulation of gas in the stomach during digestion, many women will find that releasing gas is more prevalent during menopause and pregnancy. While many women take this for granted, there are ways that can prevent and treat excessive flatulence.
