Anemia is a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen to tissues and organs throughout the body and enable them to use energy from food. Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD)â€”the permanent, partial loss of kidney function.
