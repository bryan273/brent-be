i don't see why you would, cephalexin (or Keflex) is an antibiotic. It isn't a pain reliever. If there was an infection that is causing the toothache then taking Keflex may eventually diminish the pain by eliminating the swelling from the infection. But that is at the discretion of your medical provider.
