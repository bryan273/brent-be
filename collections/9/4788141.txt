Oatmeal is beneficial in reducing acne because it cleanses your skin pores and absorbs excess oil. Plus, it exfoliates your skin. Mix one teaspoon of honey and the juice of half a lemon in a cup of cooked oatmeal. Rub this mixture over your skin. Leave it on for 30 minutes and then rinse with lukewarm water.
