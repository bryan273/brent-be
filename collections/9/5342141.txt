Liver problems often cause right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The liver helps remove toxins from the blood and when the liver becomes infected or diseased, abdominal pain is often the first symptom. An infection may also cause abdominal swelling and jaundice (yellow or sallow colored eyes and skin).
