I am 50 and have been in menopause for about 14 months. Since April of last year, I have experienced periods of INTENSE hot flashes and night sweats - sometimes 30 within 24 hours! These periods last 6-8 weeks and then the hot flashes reduce in intensity and occurance gradually over the next 10 weeks. Then, unfortunately, they start again.
