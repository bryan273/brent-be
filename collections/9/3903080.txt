Professional: OTC creams will successfully cure most cases of jock itch, but if the treatment is not successful after 3 weeks then see a Dermatologist. I recommend a Dermatologist over a General Practitioner as the former tends to have more experience and specialization in treating jock itch. Focus on prevention!
