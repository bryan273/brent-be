Medical Definition of Microangiopathy. Microangiopathy: A disease of the capillaries (very small blood vessels), in which the capillary walls become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood. For example, diabetes predisposes to the development of microangiopathy in many areas, including the eye. Search MedTerms:
