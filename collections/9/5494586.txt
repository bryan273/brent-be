It takes from month to 3 months for the liver enzymes to normalize. However it all depends how long you have bee drinking and what are your liver regeneration abilities.If you have had an alcohol occasionally, month is enough to normalize liver enzymes.If you have been drinking heavily, it may not be enough. Hope this will help. Feel free to ask further questions.owever it all depends how long you have bee drinking and what are your liver regeneration abilities.
