Getting a flu shot every year can help you stay healthy. A flu shot contains the flu vaccine, which could keep you from getting the flu. Medicare will pay for the shot, and so will many private health insurance plans. You can get a flu shot at your doctorâ€™s office or from your local health department. Sometimes grocery or drug stores offer flu shots.
