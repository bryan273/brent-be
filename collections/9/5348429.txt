Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart condition caused by the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close.The ductus arteriosus normally is a temporary blood vessel connecting the main vessel leading to the lungs (pulmonary artery) to the main vessel of the body (aorta).If the vessel remains open after birth, it is called a patent ductus arteriosus or PDA. PDA occurs in about 10 percent of newborns.f it doesnâ€™t close, the baby has the defect known as patent (open) ductus arteriosus. This defect occurs especially in premature babies who have had respiratory distress syndrome (difficult breathing) due to immature lungs. The cause of PDA is unknown.
