Causes of Vertigo. Many times, vertigo is made worse by movement or changes in position. Two common causes of vertigo are labyrinthitis (inner ear infection) or a condition called Meniere's disease. Both of these conditions are caused by fluid fluctuations in the inner ear. The ear sends a message to the brain that the victim is moving, while the eyes send a different message.
