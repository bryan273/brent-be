In most cases, doctors use a 4-phase CT scan to diagnose liver cancer. If they canâ€™t confirm that there is a tumour in the liver based on imaging tests, doctors may do a liver biopsy. Core needle biopsy uses a large, hollow, cutting needle to remove a cylinder-shaped sample (core) from a tumour or abnormal mass.
