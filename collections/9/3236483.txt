Considering that dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens is thought to play an integral role in goal-directed motor behavior, these findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex influences the behavioral impact of amygdala activation via a concomitant active suppression of accumbal dopamine release.owever, during the stimulation, dopamine release increased only in the prefrontal cortex, not in the nucleus accumbens. An increase in accumbal dopamine release was observed during the stimulation if glutamate activation in the prefrontal cortex was inhibited at either presynaptic or postsynaptic levels.
