Causes of a Bleeding Ulcer. An ulcer occurs when part of the lining of the stomach or intestines becomes deeply eroded. Most people who have an ulcer likely developed it from an infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori. Ulcers can also be caused by regular usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Ulcers range in size from quite small to an inch or more, but they can cause tremendous discomfort. Most gastrointestinal bleeding comes from ulcers. Medication and lifestyle habits can cause an ulcer to bleed.
