Inflammation of the bursa and tendons can cause pain that radiates down the arms. The fluid in a sac called the bursa which lies between the tendon and bone can become inflamed. Some sort of physical trauma can cause a fracture in the shoulder or arm, resulting in right shoulder and arm pain. Located in the back and neck, these discs can be damaged. The changed shape of the discs can affect the nerves around, resulting in referred pain and weakness down the arms.
