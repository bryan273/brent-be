A cold can make your eyes red and congested. Be careful not to touch or rub them, and wash your hands often so you don't spread the virus. Use a cool or warm compress as needed for relief. Other causes of red, congested eyes include allergies and conjunctivitis, or pink eye.. Conjunctivitis can be caused by a virus or bacteria. See your doctor if the redness and congestion don't clear up after a day or two, you develop a yellow or green discharge, or you have sudden pain or changes in your eyesight.
