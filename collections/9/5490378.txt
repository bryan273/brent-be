Normally a colon cancer can take from 7 to 10 years to develop from a polyp. That is why the recommendation for colonoscopy is every 10 years, unless there is a prior family history. However, with Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC) due to a genetic mutation a colon cancer can develop in as little as 1 to 2 years.
