In Germany for instance, oral surgery training takes 3-4 years, depending on your school. Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons on the other hand, have to have a dental degree (4 - 5 years) + medical degree (6 year), then apply for the OMFS training, which is no less than 5 years. (many opt for additional 2 years in plastic surgery).
