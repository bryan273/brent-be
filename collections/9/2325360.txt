Many of the commonly prescribed sleep aids cause sleepiness by enhancing GABA—a wide-reaching inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Orexin sleep aids block the brain’s receptors for the chemical orexin. Since they target a more localized area of the brain, the hope is that they will cause fewer side effects. Orexin Receptor Antagonists Differ from Standard Sleep Drugs by Promoting Sleep at Doses That Do Not Disrupt Cognition.
