Babies and Children. Pertussis (whooping cough) can cause serious and sometimes deadly complications in babies and young children, especially those who are not fully vaccinated. In babies younger than 1 year old who get pertussis, about half need care in the hospital. The younger the baby, the more likely treatment in the hospital will be needed.
