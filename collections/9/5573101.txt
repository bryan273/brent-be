The manufacturer's leaflet will give you more information about clindamycin, and it will also explain how to use the cream and applicator. Use clindamycin cream exactly as your doctor tells you to. It is for use in the vagina only. Use one applicatorful (approximately 5 grams) of cream in the vagina at bedtime. Your doctor will tell you how many days you should use the cream for - a course of treatment usually lasts for 3-7 consecutive days.
