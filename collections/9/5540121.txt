The patient presents with pain in the area surrounding her scar because the tissue isnâ€™t getting the blood flow and oxygen that it needs. Another way that scar tissue can wreak havoc within the pelvic floor is as a result of referred pain. Remember, there is a network of nerves that innervate the pelvic floor. If a scar is on top of or impinging on a nerve that also innervates another part of the pelvic floor, then that area can also be affected.
