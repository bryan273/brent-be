Our patients can use a hair dryer, wax, and hair gel 2 weeks after hair transplantation. Chemical straightening/coloring at 6 weeks post. Hair can be taken from other areas of the body but we find the highest level of patient satisfaction when the follicles are taken from the back or sides of the head.
