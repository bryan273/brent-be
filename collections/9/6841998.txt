Hyperthyroidism in cats is caused by an increase in production of thyroid hormones from enlarged thyroid glands, located on both sides in the cat's neck. In most cases, enlargement of the thyroid glands is caused by a tumor called an adenoma, which is almost always non-cancerous. The average age of cats with hyperthyroidism is 13 years of age; only about 5 percent of hyperthyroid cats are younger than 10 years of age.
