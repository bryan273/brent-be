1 In cases of regurgitation, it happens without warning. 2  Thereâ€™s a difference between the appearance of vomitus, regurgitus, and a third variation -- expectorate.  The causes of chronic vomiting or regurgitating are also different. Vomiting is usually tied to the diet, dietary indiscretion, possibly a toxin or foreign body, or a developing condition like inflammatory bowel disease. Regurgitation happens for reasons unrelated to the diet or health of the lower GI tract.
