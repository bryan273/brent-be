National Federation of the Blind. Braille is the raised dot system used by the blind for reading and writing. Recent publicity about Braille has brought both information and confusion to the public. As a blind person myself and as president of the nation's largest organization primarily composed of blind persons (the 50,000-member National Federation of the Blind), I think I know something about the needs of blind persons.
