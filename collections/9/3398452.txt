Eczema on the ear or in the ear can initially be caused by the skin being extra sensitive. Often the natural oil is stripped away through over cleaning or aggravated by getting water in the ear, wearing ear plugs, using cotton swabs or Q-tips or from the chemicals in shampoos, soaps and even hair spray.
