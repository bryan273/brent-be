STDs are also sometimes called sexually transmitted infections or STIs. Whatever you call them, they can cause serious health problems. And they happen a lot to young people: About half of all new infections happen to people ages 15 to 24. There are more than 25 STDs caused by many different bacteria and viruses. Each STD has its own symptoms, but some have similar symptoms. One thing is clear: If you get an unusual discharge, sore, or rash, especially in the pubic area, you should stop having sex and see a doctor right away.
