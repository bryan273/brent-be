Another cause of encephalitis under study is encephalitis believed to be caused by an autoantibody attack on subunits of brain N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. The autoantibodies are termed anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, and the disease is termed NMDA receptor encephalitis, first identified in 2007.
