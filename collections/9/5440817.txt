I had elbow surgery yesterday and had nerve block how long does it take for it to wear off? It depends! It depends on the kind of nerve block, and the kind of local anesthetic that was used. Long acting local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine and ropivacaine, might last up to 12 hours or so. There are certain additives, such as clonidine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and corticosteroids that help to prolong the effect.
