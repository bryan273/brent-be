I had my TPMS light go on just earlier this month with my snow tires on. Brought it into the tire shop, front right sensor is bad. They replaced it. Couldnt get the TPMS sensors to sync with the computer. The TPMS module did not like the 1 different sensor. I had to have all 4 replaced. Now the light is off, I have 4 new sensors with new batteries and life is good! FWIW, the independent tire shop in my area charges $50 per tire per sensor installed and programmed.
