Penguins love to swim in the ice cold ocean water. They can swim very fast and can leap out of the water and dive deep looking for food.A layer of fat together with a layer of air keeps penguins warm in the cold water and almost any weather.ost people think of penguins as living in very cold climates like the icy continent of Antarctica, but they also live in more temperate areas like the Galapagos Islands, Australia, and South Africa. Penguins are very funny animals.
