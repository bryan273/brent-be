Ear infections can last anywhere from a couple of days to a week or so depending on how fast the infection was caught by a doctor and what treatment was used. Antibiotics can help speed the healing process if it is a bacterial infection, however if it is viral, then this approach won't help. Also antibiotics won't remove the inner ear fluid.
