One official name for eye boogers is rheum. Rheum is the natural discharge of the eye, formed from a combination of mucus, tears, dust, and even skin cells from the eyelids. The eye produces rheum all day… so why does it build up overnight? When we’re awake, blinking washes rheum and tears away so we don’t get a buildup of sleepies.
