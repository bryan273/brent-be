Secret # 12 - Your ribs should take 5-6 hours to smoke, be sure to apply your mop every 45 minutes. Remember Secret #1 â€“ the thickest part of the rack of ribs should be at least 160-170 degrees F. For the last 30 minutes, wrap your ribs in heavy duty aluminum foil, apply your mop, and place them back on the smoker.
