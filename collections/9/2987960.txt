I would follow up with your health care provider so that they find out why you are swelling. Regarding your questions about cancer causing this, I do think that cancer needs to be ruled out. Certainly abdominal cancers, especially liver cancer, could cause edema. Prostate cancer should be ruled out as well, although this would be a less likely cause of your edema.
