Altogether, there are over 100 different strains of this virus. Some of these strains cause genital warts, whereas other strains of HPV lead to common warts that tend to pop up on the hands and fingers (which might be the type your beau has), plantar warts that grow on feet, and flat warts that grow on hands and legs.
