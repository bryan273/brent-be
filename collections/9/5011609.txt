What is the structure difference of the esophagus and trachea? The esophagus is a smooth tube that when we eat food goes trough the esophagus to the stomach. The trachea (windpipe) is made of cartilaginous rings that when we inhale/exhaleâ€¦ air (breath in and out) it goes to the lungs. So if food goes accidentally to your trachea, you choke.
