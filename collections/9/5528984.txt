This is the reason why carotid artery disease is termed as a 'silent killer'. Most people who have this disease, may not experience the symptoms until the blockage reaches a dangerous level. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) is the first sign of carotid artery blockage. The Transient Ischemic Attack symptoms occur when the blockage is dangerously close to complete closing of the artery. Typical TIA symptoms include, weakness and tingling in one side of the body. In addition, you may lose vision in one eye, or have slurred speech.
