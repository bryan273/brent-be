A common rule of thumb for recessions is two quarters of negative GDP growth. A depression is a prolonged period of economic recession marked by a significant decline in income and employment. There is no widely accepted definition of depressions. However, some people use a rule of thumb for a depression of 10% decline in economic output as measured by the GDP.
