Fingernail Polish. According to HomeRemedyHaven.com, only a handful of treatments exist for the home removal of skin tags, and clear fingernail polish ranks as one of the methods. The website recommends applying the polish over the entire skin tag twice daily until the tag detaches. Do not use near eyes, nostrils, lips or on anal skin tags.
