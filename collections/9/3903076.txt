Rubbing alcohol is another effective home remedy for jock itch because it kills the fungus causing the infection. Plus, being a drying agent, it helps keep the affected area dry; fungi thrive in warm, moist environments. Dip a cotton ball in 90 percent isopropyl alcohol. Dab it on the affected area.
