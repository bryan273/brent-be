Horses have a gestation period that lasts approximately 340 days. If that sounds like a long time to wait for the baby to be born, youâ€™d be no better off raising llamas (350 days) or donkeys (365 days).ome seal species give birth after 330 days, fairly similar to horses. Tapirs and rhinoceroses, moderately close relatives of equines, have even longer gestations. Tapirs have pregnancies of 440 days, while the African rhinoceros has a 480-day gestation.
