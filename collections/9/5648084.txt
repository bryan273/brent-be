I doubt you are having a heart attack. You maybe just injured your wrist in your sleep or you may have circulation problems, but heart attack pain will be in your chest and will radiate to your left arm. You are fairly young to have a heart attack. Try some pain killers with anti inflammatory agents, like Ibuprofen or Aspirin.
