Occasionally, cardiac pain is felt only in the stomach and the diagnosis of a heart attack is delayed because people think that they are suffering from heartburn. Another common symptom of a heart attack is shortness of breath. Other less common symptoms include nausea, lightheadedness, or feeling cold and clammy. If you experience any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately.
