Depending on what’s causing your dog’s constipation, your vet may recommend one or several of the following treatments: A stool softener or other laxative agent. Medication to increase the contractile strength of the large intestine. Adding fiber to your dog’s diet with canned pumpkin, wheat bran or a product such as Metamucil. A veterinarian-prescribed, high-fiber diet. An increase in exercise.
