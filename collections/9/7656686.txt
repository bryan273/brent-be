Intraocular lens implants can cause double vision if they slip out of position (rare), and the edge of the lens comes close to the pupil center. Some people after glaucoma or cataract surgery have an iridectomy done at the time of surgery. This is a hole cut into the iris usually hidden by the upper eyelid.
