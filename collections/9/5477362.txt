Basics of gout. Gout is a disease that causes sudden severe episodes of pain and tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling (inflammation) in some joints. Gout is a dramatic example of a type of arthritis called crystal arthritis, sometimes called microcrystalline arthritis because the crystals are very small.The crystals form in the joint space. As the body tries to remove the crystals, a painful inflammation occurs.ric acid usually is dissolved in the blood and passes through the kidneys into the urine. In people with gout, the uric acid level in the blood is so high that uric acid crystals are deposited in joints and other tissues.
