The most common symptom of gastritis is abdominal upset or pain. Other symptoms are belching, abdominal bloating, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and/or a feeling of fullness or of burning in the upper abdomen. Blood in your vomit or black stools may be a sign of bleeding in the stomach, as gastritis can promote ulcers to form.
