Test your pH balance. To determine how acidic your saliva is, test the balance in your mouth. Drugstores stock pH strips that you simply stick in your mouth. The strip will indicate your salivaâ€™s acidity is. If your pH level is below 7.0, your saliva is considered acidic. Change your diet. The foods you eat play a large part in saliva acidity. Meats, eggs, fish and some dairy products are highly acidic and can affect your pH balance. Reduce the amount of these foods and increase your intake of alkaline food such as berries, fruits and vegetables.
