Gestational diabetes happens when you have too much sugar (glucose) in your blood during pregnancy. Your blood sugar levels can go up when your body isn't producing enough of a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps: While you're expecting, your body has to make extra insulin, especially from mid-pregnancy onwards.
