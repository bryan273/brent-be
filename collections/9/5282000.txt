Eye teeth first on top? My 9 1/2 month old has her first tooth on the bottom front with her second coming in. On the top however we are seeing and feeling the bumps of her eye teeth, not her fronts. Is this normal and will this cause her front teeth to come in crooked? Posted: 09/18/2007 by christae99.
