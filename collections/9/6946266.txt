Understanding eczema Understanding eczema Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, may also be a long-term condition affecting the skin. It occurs because of a hypersensitivity reaction. This causes the skin to overreact to certain triggers, such as dyes, fabrics, soaps, animals, and other irritants. Eczema is very common in infants. Many people outgrow the hypersensitivity by childhood or early adulthood. Skin may appear red, inflamed, peeling, cracked, blistered, or pus-filled.
