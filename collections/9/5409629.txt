If you havenâ€™t yet missed your period a super faint or really faint line can just mean the pregnancy is early. If you have already missed your period and you have a light line on a pregnancy test, it can mean the pregnancy is in trouble. Only further evaluation can say for sure if your pregnancy is healthy.
