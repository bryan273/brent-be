Early Signs of Pregnancy. What makes PMS versus Pregnancy such a complicated issue is the fact that the earliest signs of pregnancy can appear in the first weeks after you conceive – even before you’ve missed a period. Having tender, swollen breasts (just like with PMS) is a very common first sign of pregnancy. They may feel tingly, sensitive to touch and even full. It’s really uncomfortable but it may be a warning sign that you’ve conceived, and your breasts are getting revved up for breastfeeding in nine months.
