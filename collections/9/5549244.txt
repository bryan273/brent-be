I read the 32 reviews on the drug Voltaren Topical Gel 1% and most of the people using this drug are using it for pain for carpal tunnel or back problems or other areas on the body for bone pain. I was given this cream for a bad itchy, burning rash on my neck and my face allover the neck and all over my face into the scalp.
