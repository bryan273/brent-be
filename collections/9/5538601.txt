Some women who gain little weight during pregnancy develop stretch marks. Creams or oils (such as vitamin E oil) or other treatments have not been shown to prevent stretch marks. They do, however, help with skin dryness and may reduce itching. Although stretch marks never go away, they fade to a lighter color, becoming less obvious after pregnancy.
