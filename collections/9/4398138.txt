Dual flush toilets have two flushing modes â€“ the half flush and the full flush. The half flush is designed for urine while the full flush is designed for faeces. A dual flush toilet can use as little as 3 litres of water for a half flush and 6 litres for a full flush, and they can be even more efficient than that.
