Glaucoma is not a singular eye disease, but is instead a term for several eye conditions that can damage your optic nerve. The optic nerve is the nerve that supplies visual information to your brain from your eyes. Glaucoma is usually (but not always) the result of abnormally high pressure inside the eye. Over time, the increased pressure can erode the optic nerve tissue, which may lead to vision loss or even blindness.
