Answer by JeremiahJohnson (88). A nose piercing will usually take 2 weeks to a month to heal. Then it is safe to take the ring out. However you should put the ring in once in awhile to prevent it from closing.t will take about a month for the wound to heal. Heat oil add little turermic and apply this with cotton bud on the wound at night. Trumermic works as antibiotic. Avoid eating whole grams for a period of 15 days.
