Measuring Volcanic Gases. Because volatiles play an important role in the generation, evolution and eruption of magma, it is critical that we use various tools to monitor gases both within and emitted from a volcano.he spectrometer is designed to measure the concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the volcanic plume that is emitted from the volcano. The device requires a standard, from which to analyze the ultraviolet light absorbed by the SO2 molecules in the plume.
