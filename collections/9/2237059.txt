Coconut oil is one of those pantry items that can help a dog with bad breath. It doesn’t just boost digestive, immune system, and metabolic functions — it also helps to combat canine bad breath. Put a lovin’ teaspoonful over your dog’s food every single day, and you’ll soon sniff sweeter breath — plus dogs love the taste; for them, coconut oil is a sweet treat.
