Knowing what causes loose bowels can help you find the medical treatment you need to be healthy. Diarrhea is an obvious and common cause of fecal incontinence, according to Mayo Clinic. Other causes of loose bowels include the following: -Constipation creates impacted stool that stretches the rectum and intestines and allows watery stool to leak out. -Muscle damage, including injuries to your anal sphincter, allows stool to escape.
