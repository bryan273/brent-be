Bananas may help alleviate diarrhea and associated symptoms. Bananas are a binding food, which means they help increase the form of the stool and help it to pass more slowly through the intestines. Bananas are also rich in potassium, a vital nutrient often depleted during bouts with diarrhea and vomiting.
