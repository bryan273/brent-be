Supraventricular tachycardia is a rapid heartbeat that starts in the atria or AV node, and is not usually life threatening. Common types of supraventricular tachycardia are atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia is when the ventricles beat too fast, and it is very dangerous.
