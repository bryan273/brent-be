Extreme drowsiness from use of Depakote. My husband has been on Depakote for more than 3 weeks (1000 mg/day) and still has extreme drowsiness, having to sleep much of the day. Is this normal? Have others had exprience. The Dr. has suggested changing to Keppra, but the side effects on that seem to be extreme drowsiness too.
