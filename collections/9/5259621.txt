Hallux limitus literally means stiff big toe joint. It is a condition that is characterized by decreased range of motion and pain at the big toe joint (first metatarsophalangeal joint). Over time, the limited range of motion can result in arthritis of the big toe joint. The decreased range of motion that causes hallux limitus is a common occurrence -- but it is not often recognized until the big toe becomes painful. Photo showing the usual signs of hallux limitus.
