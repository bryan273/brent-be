Obama: Worst President in History of the USA. There’s an Obama Page on Facebook that has over 131, 000 likes from people, Americans or not. There are more than double that number of people that are ‘talking about’ the page by posting it on their own walls. A fan page (of sorts) dedicated to the President of the United States. But, not your normal fan page. It’s the ‘Obama is the Worst President Ever’ page. By the time President Obama steps down from office, the USA will more than likely not be anything more than a shadow of its former self.
