Translated by E.A. Wallis Budge. The Book of the Dead is the common name for the ancient Egyptian funerary texts known as The Book of Coming [or Going] Forth By Day. The name Book of the Dead was the invention of the German Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, who published a selection of some texts in 1842.
