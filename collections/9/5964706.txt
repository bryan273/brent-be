To ward off the inflation, try these bloat-blocking foods to feel like yourself again. Rice (fully digested carbohydrates): Some foods, especially certain carbohydrates, are either indigestible or only partially digested in the gut.

Rice is fully digested in the small intestines, giving it the least potential to form gases in the gut.
