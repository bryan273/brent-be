Dehydration: A Main Cause of Chapped Lips. The most common lip problem faced by many is dry and chapped lips. Your lips are naturally coated with an oily layer to keep them protected. If that thin oily film is removed, your lips tend to become dry, cracked, sore, red and in extreme cases even bleed. Dehydration is one of the main causes of damaged lips. Dehydration means a deficiency of water content in the body. Your body is in constant need of fluids to keep the body cells hydrated and clean, but if your body is losing more water than its getting then you suffer from dehydration, which in addition to other problems, causes dry chapped lips.
