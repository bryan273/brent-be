Life Expectancy. The life expectancy of lung cancer patients depends on the cancer stage as well as how early it is detected. The five year survival rate for those with stage 1 lung cancer is 60-80%, although more recent studies show that early detection increases this rate to 90% of more. The survival rate for stage 2 is 40-50%.
