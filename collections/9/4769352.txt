Breast Cancer Types. Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive breast cancer where abnormal cells have been contained in the lining of the breast milk duct. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma means that abnormal cells that originated in the lining of the breast milk duct have invaded surrounding tissue. Triple negative breast cancer means that the cells in the tumor are negative for progesterone, estrogen, and HER2/neu receptors. Inflammatory breast cancer is a less common form of breast cancer that may not develop a tumor and often affects the skin. Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast, sometimes into the lungs, bones, or brain.
