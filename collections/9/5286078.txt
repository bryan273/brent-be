The so-called intact PTH is the most frequently ordered parathyroid hormone test. It is used to help diagnose the cause of a low or high calcium level and to help distinguish between parathyroid-related and non-parathyroid-related causes.It may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment when an individual has a parathyroid-related condition.f both PTH and calcium levels are normal, then it is likely that the body's calcium regulation system is functioning properly. Low levels of PTH may be due to conditions causing hypercalcemia or to an abnormality in PTH production causing hypoparathyroidism.
