Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): Tofranil (imipramine) is often used to treat anxiety. Other tricyclic drugs that have been found to be effective in treating panic disorder include Pamelor (nortriptyline), Norpramin (desipramine), and Anafranil (clomipramine). Tricyclics, unlike benzodiazepines, require only a single daily dose of medication.
