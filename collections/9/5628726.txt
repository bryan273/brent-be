What it is: Shoot and kill one baboon as a warning to the other baboons to stay off your property. How it is supposed to work: This idea assumes that baboons are able to make the association between one baboon being shot and a similar consequence for themselves if they enter the same property.his method causes pain to the animal and there is a risk of injuring a baboon, especially the eyes. A strike to an infant's head may cause serious injury. Also, the efficacy of this method may decrease over time due to habituation. Baboons may simply return later, when the bearer of the catapult is no longer present.
