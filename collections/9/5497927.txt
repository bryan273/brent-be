Annual Distributions. Alternatively, IRA beneficiaries are allowed to take annual distributions based on the IRS life expectancy table, instead of withdrawing the entire account within five years. Annual distributions to IRA beneficiaries must begin in the year after the account owner’s death. If annual distributions don’t start on time, however, the beneficiary must liquidate the entire IRA within five years.
