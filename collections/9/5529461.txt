â€¢ Stay away from alcohol with eczema triggers. Beers, ales, cider or pre made drinks and cocktails (like baileys, pina coladas, rum-coke, sangria), are the ones to watch out for. These types of drinks either contain wheat, milk, or high amounts of sugar that can inflame your body and cause your skin to break out.
