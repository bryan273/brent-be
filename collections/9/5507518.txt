Quick Answer. A pit bull pregnancy lasts about 63 days, but it can take anywhere from 58 to 71 days. A pit bull pregnancy that lasts 72 days or more is not normal, thus a veterinarian usually induces labor. Signs of pregnancy occur about three weeks into pregnancy, with possible nausea and loss of appetite.
