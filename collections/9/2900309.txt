In many vascular plants, secondary growth is the result of the activity of the two lateral meristems, the cork cambium and vascular cambium.Arising from lateral meristems, secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length.As long as the lateral meristems continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter.rising from lateral meristems, secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length.
