Pregnancy tests will catch less than 70% of pregnancies at 4 days before a period. A few things to understand about pregnancy tests. When they say you can test up to 5 days before a missed period, that means 4 days before your period is due. That number is based on an average luteal phase (the time between ovulation and the first day of your period) of 14 days. Which means those tests recommend testing no sooner than 10 days past ovulation.
