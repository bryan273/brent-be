The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is a gnawing or burning pain in your stomach just below your sternum. Stomach pains are triggered by hunger and occur between meals and in the early hours of the morning. Pains can be sharp or dull. Taking aspirin, or drinking orange juice or coffee can cause pain.
