A virus causes stomach flu or gastroenteritis. The most common viruses are rotavirus or norovirus. Symptoms appear one to three days after exposure to the virus. You are contagious before you even begin to develop symptoms. Even after you’ve recovered from your symptoms, you can remain contagious for up to two weeks. Dairy: Not everyone has a problem with milk when they have the stomach flu, but it could be hard to digest. 2  Fiber: You don’t need the extra fiber if your bowels are loose. 3  Grease: Avoid the greasy and salty foods like bacon. 4  Stay off tomato-based dishes, curries, and chili sauces.
