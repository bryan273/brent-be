Causes of White Spots on Skin. Your skin gets its color from melanin. Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes, and it gives pigment to hair, skin, and eyes. People with dark skin have more melanin than light-skinned people, which is the reason why their skin is darker and white spots are more noticeable.
