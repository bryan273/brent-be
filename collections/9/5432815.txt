What is bradycardia? Having bradycardia (say â€œbray-dee-KAR-dee-uh) means that your heart beats very slowly. For most people, a heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute while at rest is considered normal. If your heart beats less than 60 times a minute, it is slower than normal. A slow heart rate can be normal and healthy.
