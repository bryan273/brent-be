Retinal detachment - Causes. Causes of retinal detachment. The most common cause of retinal detachment is tiny breaks developing inside the retina. The breaks allow the fluid found between the retina and the lens of the eye to leak underneath the retina. A build-up of fluid can cause the retina to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with blood.
