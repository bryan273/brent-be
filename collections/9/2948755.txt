pregnancy, symptom, pill. I stopped taking the pill right after my last pack was done. Two days later I had sex with my husband and had a few days of bleeding. Now it is three weeks after I stopped and in the past week I have experienced a whitish thick discharge, nausea, pelvic pressure and bloating and extreme fatigue.
