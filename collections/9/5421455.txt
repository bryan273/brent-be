NSAIDs: How They Work. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most popular drugs for treating arthritis pain. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Alleve, Naprosyn), and aspirin. They work by reducing the production of substances called prostaglandins, which cause pain and inflammation in the body. NSAIDs have a dual action; they not only relieve pain, but they bring down swelling in the joints, too.
