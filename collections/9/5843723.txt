Shin splint pain is described as a recurring dull ache along the inner part of the lower two-thirds of the tibia. In contrast, stress fracture pain is localized to the fracture site. Biomechanically, over-pronation is the common cause for shin splints and action should be taken to offset the biomechanical irregularity.
