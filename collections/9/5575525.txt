But even if you like your primary care doctor, he or she may not be the right person to manage type 2 diabetes. You might be happier with someone else, or with an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone-related diseases such as diabetes. In general, family physicians are trained in all areas of medicine and treat adults and children. Internists specialize in internal medicine and only treat adults. Internists may or may not have in-depth training in diabetes (they can choose to do one to three additional years of training in one of 13 sub-specialties, such as endocrinology or cardiology). Your primary care doctor may be a great fitor not.
