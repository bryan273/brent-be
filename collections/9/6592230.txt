Bursitis: A bursa is a sac over the joints to provide a cushion to the joints and muscles. These bursae can become swollen, stiff, and painful after injuries. Heart attacks: Although the problem is the heart, heart attacks can cause shoulder or neck pain, known as referred pain. Broken shoulder blade: An injury to the shoulder blade usually is associated with relatively forceful trauma.
