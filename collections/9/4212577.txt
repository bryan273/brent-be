The fluid inside a blister is called serum or plasma. This fluid is usually clear, but it can also be red if the blister is filled with blood, or yellowish green if it is filled with pus, indicating an infection. Blisters may appear on one foot or both feet, and they do not discriminate based on gender, age, or race. Blisters on feet can be caused by numerous things, including: Forceful rubbing or friction on the foot. Bone spurs or exostoses.
