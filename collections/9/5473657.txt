The type of liver fluke endemic to our area is called Fascioloides magna. These flukes are flat, elongated, oval, and look like “leeches”. They are purple-gray in color and are found while cutting open the liver either in the packing plant or by a post-mortem examination.In the northern and northwestern regions of Minnesota the natural host of this fluke is the white-tailed deer making exposure control to this parasite difficult.hen the eggs hatch, they enter snails, which then become an intermediate host. Further development of the larvae (young flukes) occurs in vegetation until ingested by cattle. The larvae then migrate from the intestine to the liver. This migration pattern can sometimes cause massive hemorrhage or blood loss in cattle.
