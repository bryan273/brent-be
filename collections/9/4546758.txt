Volcanologists use a device called a tiltmeter to measure tiny changes in the angle of the volcano's slope that might indicate a build-up of gases below the surface that could result in an eruption.These changes are too small to be seen by the eye but can still indicate that an eruption is imminent.he most basic tool used by any volcanologist is a simple rock hammer, used for breaking off samples of igneous rock for laboratory analysis. Other samples are collected from the volcano's core using a drill.
