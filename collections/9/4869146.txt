Kyphosis is most common in the thoracic spine, though it can also affect the cervical and lumbar spine. There are several causes of kyphosis in adults. The first is congenital, which means it is a condition present from birth. A congenital spine problem affects the development of the spine. The second cause is traumatic, which means it is caused by a trauma or injury to the spine.
