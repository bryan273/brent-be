Pineappleitis: Pineapple commonly causes minor skin irritation because it's highly acidic. It's common for your tongue to feel gritty, itchy and mildly painful after eating pineapple. If you develop severe pain, itching, burning or swelling in your tongue from eating pineapple, you should talk with your doctor.
