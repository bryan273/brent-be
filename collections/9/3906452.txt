This is not necessarily true. HPV is the only STD which may show up on a Pap smear. Even if the Pap smear indicates that you do have abnormal cells, you may have to take an additional test specifically for HPV. Although some gynecologists do routine testing for other STDs alongside the Pap smear, not all of them do. You need to be sure exactly which tests you’ve had and which you haven’t.
