A weighted squat machine gets your butt muscles fired up as you use your glutes to power your body on the upward phase. Standing low hip cable abduction works the butt and hip area for that sexy, hourglass curve. A leg press machine will work your butt muscles while also giving you the added benefit of toned thighs. While on the leg press, position your feet wider than hip width apart with your toes pointing outward for an extra challenge.
