The aim of the second trimester is growth. By the fourth month of pregnancy, your baby is fully formed. Every organ, including brain, kidneys, spinal cord, eyes, toes, fingers, lungs and heart, is formed and fully functional. The body works hard to calcify the babyâ€™s bones and to fine tune all the organs.
