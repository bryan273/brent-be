What is stillbirth? When a baby dies in utero at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later, it's called a stillbirth. (When a pregnancy is lost before 20 weeks, it's called a miscarriage.) About 1 in 160 pregnancies ends in stillbirth in the United States. Most stillbirths happen before labor begins, but a small number occur during labor and delivery.
