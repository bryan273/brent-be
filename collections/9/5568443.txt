A broken arm or wrist is usually caused by a fall onto an outstretched arm. It typically takes about six to eight weeks to heal in adults, and less time in children.Doctors refer to all breaks or cracks in bones as fractures.Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you think you or your child has broken a bone. useful rule of thumb is that the time taken for the bone to regain full strength is usually the same as the time it takes for the fracture to heal. That is, if youâ€™ve been in plaster for six weeks, it will take six weeks to regain full strength. It's important not to get a plaster cast wet.
