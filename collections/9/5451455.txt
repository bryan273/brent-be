Blood contains red cells, white cells, and platelets. The red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen throughout the body. Men have about 5.2 million red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood, and women have about 4.7 million per cubic millimeter of blood. Anemia means an abnormally low number of red cells in the blood.
