Annular tear and irritated spinal nerve root. Selective nerve root blocks are one of the most commonly given spinal injections. They can be used to treat or diagnose back and/or leg pain due to damaged nerve roots. A nerve root is a collection of nerves that have branched off the main spinal cord on their way out to serve the rest of the body.
