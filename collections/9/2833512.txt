For muscle growth, you need to drink a whey protein shake before or after exercise each day you workout. For example, if you workout five days per week, then five whey protein drinks would increase your muscle mass. Whey protein is also a fast digesting protein, which gives your body a rapid source of amino acids to help build muscle. Whey protein also enhances anabolism during the day when drank between meals.
