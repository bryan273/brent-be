Puberty doesn't happen all at once â€” it happens in stages. Guys usually start puberty later than girls, when they're around 10 to 12 years old. Some start sooner and others later. You may continue to go through puberty changes until you're 20 years old. A guy may show some signs of puberty at an early age (like a voice that's starting to crack) but may not show other signs of puberty until years later (like growing facial hair).
