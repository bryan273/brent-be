The present paper aims to assess the effect of a brief standardized normobaric hypoxia in healthy subjects on the frequency of PB-EPCs, and to evaluate early molecular events implicated in the activation and/or recruitment of these cells.he induction of hypoxia was confirmed by Alveolar Oxygen Partial Pressure (PAO 2) and Spot Oxygen Saturation decreases. Heart rate increased, but arterial pressure and respiratory response were unaffected. The change in PB-EPCs percent from T0 to T1 was inversely related to PAO 2 at T1.
