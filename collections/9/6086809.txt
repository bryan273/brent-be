I am having pregnancy symptoms (nausea, tender nipples) but I got a BFN (big fat negative) on my home pregnancy test. Those could be pregnancy symptoms, and you may indeed be pregnant, especially if you had intercourse during your fertile time and took that pregnancy test before you were really late..
