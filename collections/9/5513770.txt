Binge-eating is in the genes. Binge-eaters often say they have no control over their eating habits - now science has managed to prove them right. New research has found that a faulty gene, rather than feeble willpower, could be responsible for binge-eating. Binge-eaters frequently and compulsively stuff themselves with food, often in secret, and tend to feel ashamed afterwards.
