Protons and neutrons do not have the same mass. Their masses are quite close, but they are noticeably different. For some purposes it is okay to equate the neutron and proton mass, but it's just an approximation.Also, neutrons decay into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino.rotons and neutrons do not have the same mass.
