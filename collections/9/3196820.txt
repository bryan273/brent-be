First, wet the washcloth with cold water, then splash on a little apple cider vinegar to the cloth. Dab the wet cloth onto your sunburn, soaking the skin. You should notice instant relief from any stinging! It feels sooo good on a sunburn. After a few minutes, your skin should be dry. Now, liberally rub on some coconut oil to the area. UPDATE: I now use Lavender and Peppermint essential oils with the coconut oil, just by melting a little in my hand, and adding about 2 drops Lavender, and one drop Peppermint.
