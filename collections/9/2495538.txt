Ear itching is a tickling, irritating sensation accompanied by the persistent need to scratch your ear. Redness, swelling, soreness, flaking and scarring may occur in the area of itchiness. The medical term for itchiness is pruritus. Although scratching may temporarily relieve your symptoms, it can cause more irritation or lead to an infection. With most cases of itching, it is best to refrain from scratching and leave the area alone to heal. Itching can be a symptom of ear infection. A common ear infection is otitis externa, commonly known as swimmerâ€™s ear, which can occur when moisture remains in the ear after swimming or other exposure to water. Other possible causes of ear itching include insect bites, contact allergies, and trauma.
