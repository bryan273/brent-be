There are two basic types of bradycardia: 1  Sick sinus syndrome occurs when the sinus node (the heart's own pacemaker) fails and does not reliably trigger heartbeats. 2  Heart block is a complete or partial interruption of the electrical impulses on their way to the ventricles and results in a slow, unreliable heartbeat.
