This is often the first test your doctor will do to look for any masses or spots on the lungs. Plain x-rays of your chest can be done at imaging centers, hospitals, and even in some doctors’ offices. If the x-ray is normal, you probably don’t have lung cancer (although some lung cancers may not show up on an x-ray).If something suspicious is seen, your doctor may order more tests.lain x-rays of your chest can be done at imaging centers, hospitals, and even in some doctors’ offices.
