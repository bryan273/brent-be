Snow blindness is usually temporary and is due to swelling of cells of the corneal surface. Even in the most severe of cases of snow blindness, the individual is still able to see shapes and movement. People often say, I am 'blind as a bat' without my glasses.. All bat species have eyes, and most have excellent vision. More importantly, the term blindness means the inability to see despite wearing glasses.
