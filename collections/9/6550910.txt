Systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP) is defined as the mean perfusion pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. MAP is sensed by baroreceptors located in the carotid sinuses and the arch of the aorta. These receptors control arterial pressure mainly by adjusting heart rate and arteriolar vessel radius.
