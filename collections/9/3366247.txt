Dry Skin. When your ears don’t produce the right amount of ear wax, the skin in your ear canal is unprotected. This can lead to dry skin in your ear canal. Dry skin can be VERY itchy, especially if/when it starts to flake. A lack of ear wax may be the reason you have an itchy inner ear. Otitis media and otitis externa (swimmer’s ear) are two common ear infections that may be the cause of your itchy ears.
