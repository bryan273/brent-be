A ‘flush’ is a term which applies generally to Darjeeling teas and refers to a specific harvest of the tea leaves within the year. The ‘first flush’ relates to the first crop taken in the spring, whilst the ‘second flush’ is the second batch of leaves picked at the end of the summer. Some farmers take a third yield of tea (and usually the last of the year) after the end of the summer, this third crop is called the ‘autumn flush’. More rarely there can be smaller intermediate flushes between the first, second and autumn – although this is dependant on the timings and strength of the monsoons.
