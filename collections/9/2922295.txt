This is particularly true when it comes to gastroenterologist’s “treatment options” for GERD and gastritis. One of the most over prescribed prescription medications has to be the proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Such medications are used to treat GERD/Acid reflux. These include over the counter medications like Mylanta, Gaviscon , Maalox or Rolaids or prescription only medications such as Prilosec, Nexium and Prevacid. In 2012 the estimate of prescriptions written for PPI’s was 157 million.
