Re: Drinking warm water for constipation, general bowle movements??? caffeine will do that but I have read in an ostomy guide pamphlet about the bowel stimulation that a cup of warm water may have. Frankly a cup of tea is more appealing and is still warm water. I would warm up a glass of cold water and not drink the warm water supply in the house. The above poster is correct in that warm water contains more dissolved minerals than cold water including lead from the solder used to connect copper pipes.
