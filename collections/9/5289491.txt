Prices of homes are differant in every state. A house that would be 150,000 dollars in Michigan would be 1,500,000 in California. So in my honest opinion, 75,000 dollars is not a realistic answer for a 600 square foot home. If you are willing to pay that much for a home you should be put in a nut house!
