If you can do this then you may find you get the Severe Disability Premium. I was on Incapacity Benefit and claimed Income Support with the Disability Premium, Severe Disability Premium and Enhanced Disability Premium as I have 'severe Mental Issues' (Schizophrenia).gnore ANYONE who says you can only get the Severe Disability Premium if you are 'Physically Disabled' as this is horse crap. People who say this are complete IDIOTS and know nothing of the Benefit System.
