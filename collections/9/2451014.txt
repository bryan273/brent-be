Mechanism of Gas and Flatulence. Flatulence is a voluntary or involuntary expulsion of gas through the anus commonly referred to as passing gas or ‘farting’. Gas produced by the breakdown of food within the gastrointestinal tract may cause bloating and discomfort which is relieved upon passing flatus (‘fart’). Digestion is a physical and chemical process that produces byproducts, including gas that is passed out as flatus.
