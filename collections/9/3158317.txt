Our dogs don’t usually sneeze for the same reasons we do, for example, as a result of allergies or a cold. Common causes of persistent sneezing in dogs include foreign bodies in the nose (including foxtails), nasal Aspergillus infections, nasal mites, and nasal tumors. Some dogs — especially small breeds — sneeze when they’re excited. Some dogs “reverse sneeze,” a respiratory event that isn’t actually a sneeze at all.
