Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) ESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can't be passed in the urine. It involves using ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine.
