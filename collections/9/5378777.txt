Acid Reflux. Too bad she didn't have any answer on how to get rid of it--just how to cope. In my case the stomach spasms occurred before gas pains and the reflux. She said to take Gas X immediately at the first sign of pain, to drink a full glass of water and to double up on my PPI for 2 weeks when the symptoms start. It does seem to help.
