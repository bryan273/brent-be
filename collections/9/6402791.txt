In order to calculate the R-value of a given insulating material, multiply the temperature difference from one side of the material to the other by the surface area of the material and by the period of time being measured, then divide the product by the observed heat loss as measured in BTUs.he R-value of a given material is a little less than six times greater than its RSI value. If you need to convert RSI to R-value, multiplying RSI by 5.68 will give you the material's R-value.
