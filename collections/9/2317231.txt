Scleritis is inflammation of the tough, white structural wall of the eyeball, the sclera. The sclera is made of collagen and is continuous with the cornea, the clear window through which we see that makes up the front wall of the eye. Blood vessels run along and sometimes through the sclera, and can contribute to inflammation.
