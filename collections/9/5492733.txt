Basically, a hernia is a defect in the abdominal wall that allows intestine to poke through. If the hernia becomes incarcerated (the intestine becomes strangled), then a blockage and rupture of the bowel can occur. This is life threateneing. Many people survive, but are permanently disfigured. A perforated bowel can mean months in the hospital, large portions of the bowel being removed, etc.
