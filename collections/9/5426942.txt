The best source of iron is red meat, especially beef and liver. Chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish also are good sources of iron. The body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods. However, some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels. Examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include: 1  Iron-fortified breads and cereals. 2  Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas. 3  Tofu. 4  Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots.
