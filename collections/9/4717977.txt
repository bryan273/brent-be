Vomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (frequent, watery bowel movements) can be harmful because they can cause dehydration. Dehydration occurs when you lose too much fluid. Vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by a number of things, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, certain medicines, or certain medical conditions. Foods that are hard to digest (such as too many sweets) and undercooked (raw or partially raw) meat or fish can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.
