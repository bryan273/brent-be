Mumps is a contagious viral infection spread by bodily fluids that causes uncomfortable symptoms like swelling of the salivary glands, fever, body aches, and fatigue. In some cases, people who contract mumps have no symptoms. Rarely, people will develop serious complications with mumps, including inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report less than 1000 cases annually, thanks to widespread vaccination.
