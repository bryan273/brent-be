Best Answer: I have had thyroid tests and cholesterol work done. I would say that 12 days or possibly even 14 days would be sufficient time for these tests. Call your Doctor and ask to speak with Dr. or your Dr's nurse. had blood work done about a week ago for a possible thyroid problem. I know that that is a pretty in depth test, they check cholesterol, t3, t4, and TSH, but its coming up on 8 days with no news from the Dr., just seems a little long to me. I asked them to call either way just so I know. Add your answer. Source.
