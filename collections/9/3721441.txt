The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands, located in the neck, that control the body's calcium levels. Each gland is about the size of a grain of rice (weighs approximately 30 milligrams and is 3-4 millimeters in diameter). The parathyroids produce a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTHPTH - parathyroid hormone raises the blood calcium level by: breaking down the bone (where most of the body's calcium is stored) and causing calcium release. increasing the body's ability to absorb calcium from food.
