Best Answer: No, there is no need to cover it. Ham is already cooked, so you just have to heat it thru. Cook it in the oven at 250 for about an hour. It will not brown at that temperature. You don't have to cover the ham especially if you use a glaze, but if you want you could also use a deep enough pan for the ham and flip a cookie sheet over the top to act as a lid. NO it is not required at all and it will get noice and crusty just as ppl have said keep the temp low and dont overcook it.
