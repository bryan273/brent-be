Skin conditions such as psoriasis and dermatitis are at the root of an itchy scalp for many patients but the condition itself is not the cause of hair loss. Hair loss is the result of patient reactions and treatments to the itchy skin and flaking. Scratching the scalp to remove flakes or excessive scratching can lead to hair loss. Additionally, shampoo and skin treatments for the conditions may be too harsh to hair strands and follicles.
