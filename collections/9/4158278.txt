An excellent source of vitamin C is citrus fruit. Many vegetables are also excellent sources of vitamin C, such as broccoli, kale, bok choy, turnip greens, beet green, mustard greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, and asparagus. Many of the B-vitamins are also very important in supporting a healthy immune system. For example, vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) promotes the production and release of antibodies from B-cells, and deficiency of vitamin B5 results in reduced levels of circulating antibodies.
