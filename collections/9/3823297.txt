I'm on day 4 and still not in ketosis, according to the test strips. How long did it take you to get into ketosis? I'm having on average 15 carbs/day and twice I've had an Atkins snack bar. I drink about a gallon of water every day, and have one diet soda at night. The more fat you eat, the easier a time you'll have getting into ketosis. 2  Try skipping the Atkins bar. 3  These stall many people and/or cause them to drop out of ketosis. 4  Others can handle them fine.
