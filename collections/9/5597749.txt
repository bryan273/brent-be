Doxycycline and Urinary Tract Infections. A urinary tract infection is commonly caused by bacteria present in your urethra (the opening that urine escapes through), your bladder or your ureters (the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder). Doctors commonly treat some types of urinary tract infections with the prescription medication doxycycline. Doxycycline is an antibiotic drug that is effective against urinary tract infections caused by the Klebsiella strain of bacteria, reports RxList. Your doctor identifies the type of bacteria responsible for your infection by examining the bacteria in a urine sample under a microscope or through urinalysis testing.
