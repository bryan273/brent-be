Generally, 14 year old average cruising speed would be about 65 mph. Average freshman pitcher (14 to 15 year old) cruising speed would be about 70 mph. Average cruising speed for a good high school pitching prospect at 14 to 15 years old would be about 75 mph.That will usually get a freshman pitcher onto the JV team, assuming reasonable pitching ability to go along with the pitching velocity. Cruising at 80 mph as a freshman would be a potential star.'m often asked what are the ranges (average, above average, excellent) for a 10, 11 or 12 year old's baseball pitching speed. Some of the kids that I do pitching lessons for that are 10-12 years old are around 50 mph to low 60's mph. Yet, I'd like to encourage you to try not to worry too much about speed at this age.
