Often, knee pain is caused by the tendons, ligaments and muscles that surround the knee becoming too tense. Stretching before bed helps loosen the tissues that surround the knee and can reduce knee pain. Place a small pillow between your knees once you are ready to go to sleep. Your knees sometimes rub against each other when you sleep on your side, which might cause pain and discomfort. Placing a pillow between your knees helps prevent this from happening. Do light exercise during the day. When the muscles that support your knees weaken, knee pain is likely to occur.
