Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria.These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins (poisons) that cause vomiting or diarrhoea.hen the rice is cooked, the spores can survive.
