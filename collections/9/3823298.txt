If you stick to 20 carbs a day, in two days you should be in ketosis. That doesn't mean it will show up on a Ketostix, but you will be none the less. (There are many reasons why it may not show up on a Ketostix.) But this doesn't necessarily mean that the carb cravings will go away in two days.nd no, drinking water doesn't do it for me. So generally speaking, how long does it take for the body to lose the sugar cravings and leave your system. Also on average, how long does it take the body to go into ketosis.
