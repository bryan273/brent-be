Some of the more common causes of sore or painful tongue include canker sores, cold sores, bite injuries, and burns. In some cases, pain that originates in other sources (such as cardiac angina or problems with the teeth and/or jaws) can be experienced in the tongue, even though the tongue itself is normal.
