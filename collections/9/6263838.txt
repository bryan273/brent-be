Resistance - is opposition to flow and is a measure of the amount of friction blood encounters as it passes through the vessels. Blood flow (F) is directly proportional to the difference in blood pressure (δP) between two points in the circulation, that is, the blood pressure, or hydrostatic pressure, gradient. Thus, when δP increases, blood flow speeds up, and when δP decreases, blood flow declines.
