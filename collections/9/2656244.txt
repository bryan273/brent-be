Think rigid. Rigidity is a condition of hardness, stiffness or inflexiblity. You find this with muscle contractures. Now think spastic. Spasticity is a form of muscular hypertoncity (excessive muscle tone) with increased resistance to stretching. It usually occurs in the flexor muscles of the arms and legs. You would see movement that requires greater effort and with a lack of control and coordination.
