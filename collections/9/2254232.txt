According to kidshealth.org, diaper rash usually goes away within 2 to 3 days with home care. Home treatment is usually all that is needed for most cases of diaper rash. But in some cases, it can last longer. A diaper rash is often caused by a reaction to disposable diapers, diarrhea, urine or soaps.
