If you have regular periods, you’ll probably know when this is. If you’re not sure when your next period is due, you can do a pregnancy test 21 days (three weeks) after you last had unprotected sex. See Further information below for links to more about how your menstrual cycle works. Some very sensitive tests can be used even before you miss a period.
