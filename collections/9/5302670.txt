Athlete's Foot. Athlete's foot (also called ringworm of the foot and tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the foot, especially between the toes. Essential oils that are particularly helpful in treating athlete's foot include tagetes, lavender, geranium and tea tree, for their anti-fungal properties. Essential oils can be applied to the feet in the bath, soaking in a foot bath or as a warm compress. They can also be applied using a carrier oilâ€”calendula oil is a good one to use.
