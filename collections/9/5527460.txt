How long do dilating drops last? Dilating eye drops used for examination of the eye usuallylast from 4 to 24 hours, depending upon the strength of the drop and upon the individual patient. Pupil dilation tends to last longer in people with lighter colored eyes (irides), and occasionally a childâ€™s eyes may stay dilated for longer than 24 hours.
