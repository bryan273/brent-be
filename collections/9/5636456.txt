Pressure is merely force per area, so if the force increases but the box stays the same size, the pressure has increased. Air density can decrease with temperature if pressure is also decreasing. If pressure is constant, this cannot happen (they would be inversely related). Any time you specify a relation between any two of pressure, density or temperature you must hold the third constant or specify its behavior.
