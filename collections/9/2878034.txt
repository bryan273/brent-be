Alcohol-Induced Blackouts, Amnesia and Memory Loss. Memory loss and amnesia are common side effects of binge drinking. When people black out, they are conscious but unable to create long-term memories. They are often awake, alert and able to hold conversations. However, they’ll forget the conversations within minutes and won’t remember anything the next day.
