People who are susceptible to oxalate stones can prevent the oxalate build up several ways: 1  Drink plenty of fluids. 2  Eat calcium-containing foods -- the calcium binds the oxalate in the gut preventing it from being absorbed. 3  Avoid foods containing oxalates. Spinach seems to produce the most oxalate. Other oxalate-containing foods include beans, beets, berries, green peppers, chocolate, coffee, colas, peanuts, peanut butter, and wheat bran.
