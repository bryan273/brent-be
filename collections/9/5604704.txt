Bulimia Nervosa Overview. Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting.he average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older. Most bulimics go through a period of prolonged dieting or restricted eating before the cyclic binging-purging episodes begin.
