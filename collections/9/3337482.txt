Peritoneal mesothelioma affects the lining of the abdomen and is the second most common type of mesothelioma. It makes up about 20 percent of all mesothelioma cases. Just like pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos. When someone ingests microscopic asbestos fibers, the tiny sharp particles get embedded in the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum). Over a course of 20 to 50 years, the fibers in the peritoneum cause mutations in the surrounding healthy mesothelial cells.
