Student: Tetanus is a disease caused by Clostridium tetani whereas tetany is a consequence of hypocalcemia. Teacher: You are correct. My comments: While there is nothing really wrong with the above dialog, it reads as though tetanus and tetany are two different things. My point is, in a mechanistic sense, there is little difference between tetanus and tetany but this is not commonly noted.
