The difference between a period and implantation bleeding is that a period is heavier â€¦ and lasts for longer and will need a tampon or sanitary towel, but implantation bleeding is light, not constant and only lasts about 1-2 days.You only need a pantyliner.mplantation bleeding is only a few spots of blood, nothing like a period. There's no flow to Implantation bleeding and it just spots of blood which I've had mine was stringy pink blood in discharge. Implantation blood can be brown/pink/red.
