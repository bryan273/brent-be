The usual incubation time between tick bite and symptom onset is 5-10 days. Only about half of patients recall a preceding tick bite. Initial symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are usually non-specific, consisting of fever, severe headache, myalgias, nausea and loss of appetite. Many patients will present to physicians before the hallmark rash develops, which complicates diagnosis and increases the diseaseâ€™s potential deadliness.
