What causes esophageal varices? Esophageal varices occur when normal blood flow to your liver is slowed. Liver disease may create scar tissue in the liver which slows the flow of blood. When the blood to your liver is slowed, it begins to back up, leading to an increase of pressure in the major vein (portal vein) that carries blood to your liver.
