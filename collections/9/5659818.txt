Summary. 1  Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation involving any part of the gastrointestinal tract. 2  The diagnosis of Crohn's disease is based on a constellation of clinical, endoscopic, radiographic, and histological findings, with negative stool cultures. The differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease includes infectious colitis, diverticulitis, celiac sprue, intestinal lymphoma, radiation enteropathy, NSAID use, and ischemic colitis. Treatment options depend on the severity of disease as well as the behavior of disease.
