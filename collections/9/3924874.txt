Treatment of iron deficiency is usually easily accomplished with oral iron supplementations. IN rare cases iron needs to be given intravenously, but this route risks serious allergic reactions and is avoided when possible. Lead poisoning is the next most common and one of the most serious causes of microcytic anemia. It needs to be suspected in any young child with microcytic anemia who does not respond quickly to iron supplementation, or who lives in a home with lead pain exposure. This is mostly older homes.
