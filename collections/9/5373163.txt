Classic (Swedish) massage and Thai massage have been proven to relieve chronic lower back pain. Classic massage for lower back pain is a technique that relaxes muscles in the area through the application of pressure. The area is rubbed in the direction in which blood flows back to the heart. Thai massage, on the other hand, is a technique that pulls and stretches the area of the back and neck.
