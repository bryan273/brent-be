Lamictal rashes appear like small raised bumps, blisters or inflammation on skin. They are red, splotchy patches that may look very similar to slightly large goose bumps. The rashes are usually very itchy as well as painful. They may be of the size of a quarter and the intensity may vary from person to person.
