Plants that have been damaged are particularly susceptible to being infected by tomato early blight alternaria. When a plant is infected with Alternaria Alternata, it will normally appear first on the lower leaves of the plant in the form of plant leaf spots that are either brown or black. These tomato leaf spots will eventually migrate to the stem and even the fruit of the tomato.
