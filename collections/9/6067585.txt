Lemon has also been found beneficial as a home remedy for knee pain caused by arthritis. The citric acid found in lemon works as a solvent for uric acid crystals, which is the cause of some types of arthritis. Cut one or two lemons into small pieces. Tie the pieces in a cotton cloth and dip it in warm sesame oil.
