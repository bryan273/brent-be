What Are the Symptoms of a Dry Socket? Patients describe the pain from dry socket symptoms as a dull, throbbing pain to a sharp stabbing pain that is aggravated by eating and is tender to the touch. The pain usually starts about three days after the extraction, and a dry socket rarely goes away by itself.
