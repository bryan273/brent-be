As with all medication, chemo is accompanied by certain side-effects. One lesser known side effect of chemo is the loss of hearing. Certain drugs used in chemo are ototoxic, or poisonous to the ear. Ototoxicity may cause permanent sensorineural hearing loss, due to the effects of the drugs on our inner ear hair cells.
