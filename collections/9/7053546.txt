Some things that lower a woman's risk for ovarian cancer include: 1  Taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives). But this may slightly increase the risk for breast cancer and other health problems. 2  Having babies and breast-feeding. 3  Having both tubes tied (tubal ligation) or having a hysterectomy.
