I usually leave the skins on when I make potato salad — I like the spots of color they add to the dish, plus they're thin enough that they're usually quite tender. If you'd prefer to peel your potatoes, it's easiest to boil them whole, then peel them and cut them into chunks. → For step-by-step instructions on this step, see How To Boil Potatoes. Classically, mayo and mustard are used to bind together those tender chunks, while celery and shallots add some crunch.
