Good question. Here's your rule of thumb. The death certificate will always be filed in the county/state where the person died. Note that your question was framed on the 2nd half of the 19th Century - 1850-1900. Depending on the year many states did not have any statewide registration of vital records - so no record would be filed in those states.
