The most effective way to lose weight is to eat healthy, know your portion sizes, log all your meals and snacks, track your weight and measurements and exercise daily. Your exercise should consist of at least 30 minutes of cardio five to six days a week and 20 to 30 minutes of strength training 3 days a week.
