Cursed with size 8 feet, corns and unevenly long toes Paulina Charlikowska used to despair over her hideous feet, but since she had toe-shortening surgery she can't get enough of them. I think I've got a foot fetish now, said the 30-year-old. get women sending me pictures of their toes all the time.. After much research Paulina decided that Mr Hargrave, who performs 350-400 procedures a year, was the best man for the job. And in October 2013, Paulina had her second and third toes shortened by a centimetre, in an operation that cost Â£4,500.
