Although most limps need veterinary attention, there are a few first aid measures you can perform at home if your cat begins to hobble around. Lameness occurs due to the injury or debilitation of one or more parts of the leg---joints, bones, muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, or skin. The cause of some limps is obvious. With a broken bone or dislocated joint, there may be swelling and the leg may lie at an awkward angle.
