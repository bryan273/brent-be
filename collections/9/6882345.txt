A Dr. Darshan N. Shah, MD , Neurology, answered on behalf of NorthShore University HealthSystem. Transient neurological symptoms are common in patients with multiple sclerosis, last seconds to minutes and can occur many times a day. Typical transient neurological symptoms in MS include numbness/tingling/electric shock like sensations, double vision, dizziness or vertigo, muscle spasms or stiffness and unsteadiness. They occur as a result of cross talk between injured nerve fibers and often resolve spontaneously.
