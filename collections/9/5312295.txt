Wind is a clean and renewable energy source that can produce enough electricity to power millions of homes and businesses. In simple terms, wind is the movement of air created by the uneven heating of the surface of the earth by the sun. Today, wind energy is primarily used for the production of electricity. The process by which wind is used to generate electricity is referred to as wind energy. Wind turbines convert wind's kinetic energy to mechanical power. This mechanical power can then be converted into electricity through the use of a generator.
