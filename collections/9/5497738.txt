Best Answer: About 3 to 5 minutes for shredded, .10-20 minutes, for wedges or chunks. It depends on how soft you want your cabbage to be and what else you are putting in with it and how large are your pieces. It's important to remember cabbage reduces and creates more liquid as it cooks. Generally , about the same time as it takes potatoes after they come to a boil - 20n minutes will give you a firm but cooked leaf otherwise if you like it more tender then 30 minutes. If you like it limpy then add increments of 10 minutes.
