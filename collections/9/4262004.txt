If you donâ€™t have kidney disease and just want to eat a healthy diet for your kidneys, be sure to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds to get a balance of both potassium-rich and moderate-potassium containing foods.he American Kidney Fund advises a moderate amount of protein (40-50 grams) be consumed for those with kidney disease, and one or two vegetables and fruits at each meal for overall kidney function and balance. Meat, dairy, eggs, and alcohol are some of the biggest foods to avoid.
