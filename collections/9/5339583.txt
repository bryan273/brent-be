Shear Modulus or Modulus of Rigidity is the coefficient of elasticity for a shearing or torsion force. Modulus of Rigidity-G - (or Shear Modulus) is the coefficient of elasticity for a shearing force.It is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the displacement per unit sample length (shear strain) .Modulus of Rigidity can be experimentally determined from the slope of a stress-strain curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material.Definition of Modulus of Rigidity: 1  The ratio of shear stress to the displacement per unit sample length (shear strain).t is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the displacement per unit sample length (shear strain) . Modulus of Rigidity can be experimentally determined from the slope of a stress-strain curve created during tensile tests conducted on a sample of the material.
