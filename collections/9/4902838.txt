Renin is converted to a chemical called angiotensin II, which further tightens your blood vessels. In addition, neurotransmitters are thought to make the kidneys produce more renin, increasing blood pressure even more. Your kidneys also regulate your blood pressure in another way. When there is not enough fluid in your body as in cases where you are dehydrated or have experienced very heavy bleeding, your kidneys will absorb salt, or sodium, and fluid from your urine.
