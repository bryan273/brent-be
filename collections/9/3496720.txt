Posted 3/17/2011 9:04 PM (GMT -6) Muscle weakness and muscle loss (death of cells) are 2 different issues. Lupus can cause muscles to weaken but disuse atrophy (less activity) over a long period of time can profoundly weaken muscles. If your muscles are just weakened they can be restrengthened with PT and exercise.
