Nosebleeds are common, and while the cause may be unclear at first, most cases are minor and can be managed from home. Immediate causes of nosebleeds include trauma to the nose from an injury, deformities inside the nose, inflammation in the nose, or, in rare cases, intranasal tumors. Any of these conditions can cause the surface blood vessels in the nose to bleed.
