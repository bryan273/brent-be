Cold brewed iced tea can be infused with herbs and fruits like mint, raspberries or cucumber. You can also use it to make Arnold Palmersâ€¦ so delicious! Just measure out 1 tablespoon loose leaf tea for every 24 ounces of water (more if you like your tea extra strong, or want to save time). Allow it to sit in your fridge, covered, for up to 10 hours. I like to do it while I'm sleeping, overnight. Remove the tea leaves from your pitcher and enjoy your brew.
