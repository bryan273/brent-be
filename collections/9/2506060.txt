I'm going to go technical on you here so bear with me. If you can lower the temperature of you mac and cheese below 6 degrees celcius under 4 hours from oven hot (a feat that requires a blast chiller) you can safely store your food for 4 days and eat it cold, 5 to six days if you reheat it up to atleast 65 degrees. The unsafe zone is between 52 and 8 degrees where bacterie multiply the fastest.
