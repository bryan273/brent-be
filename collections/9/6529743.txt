Nasal polyps are soft, sac-like growths on the lining of the nose or sinuses. Nasal polyps can grow anywhere on the lining of the nose or the sinuses. They often grow where the sinuses open into the nasal cavity. Small polyps may not cause any problems. Large polyps can block your sinuses or nasal airway. Nasal polyps are not cancer.
