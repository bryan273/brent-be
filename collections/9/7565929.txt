Welcome to Hypopara Answers: A resource for patients and families managing this challenging condition. Hypoparathyroidism is a rare, complex condition caused by missing, damaged, or dysfunctional parathyroid glands. When parathyroid glands don't function properly, the body can't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH) to help regulate the amounts of calcium and phosphorus in the body.
