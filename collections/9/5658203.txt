When the water comes to a boil, put the tomatoes in one at a time until the pan is nearly full. It's a good idea to use a large slotted spoon to put the tomatoes into the pan to avoid splashing boiling water. Leave the tomatoes in the boiling water until the skins begin to split. This usually takes about 1-2 minutes.
