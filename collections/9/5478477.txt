Summary:  Hematemesis, which is commonly referred to as a dog vomiting blood is either caused by something temporary such as the ingestion of an object your dog ate after being outside, causes such as dietary intolerance, or something systemically wrong such as with the digestive tract (GI), liver or kidneys. Do the same with your dog. 2  If your dog's gums feel dry and not wet like yours, then your pet may be suffering from dehydration. 3  The other method is called tenting. 4  Pull the skin gently up along the pets neck in one spot to form a temporary tent. 5  The skin should pull back into position in 2 seconds or less.
