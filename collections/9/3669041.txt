back toric contact lens A contact lens used to correct corneal astigmatism in which the surface of the lens facing the cornea is not spherical but toroidal in order to obtain a good physical fit on the cornea. To create better stability of the lens on the eye it usually incorporates a prism ballast. See ballast.
