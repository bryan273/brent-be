Hearing aids help people who’ve experienced hearing loss enjoy a better quality of life — but the devices can be expensive. The average price of one hearing aid is $2,300. Most people need two, doubling the cost. If your health insurer doesn’t offer coverage, you’ll want to have enough money in savings or a good cash-back credit card to cover the expense. The total cost depends on the type of hearing aid, its features and the level of professional services. Cost breakdown Typically, the hearing aid itself makes up only one-third of the total cost; professional fees and services account for the rest.
