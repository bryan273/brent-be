I am in the same boat as the rest of you. There is a website you can order pregnancy test from like the dr.s use. they are very sensitive and can tell you as early as 7 days after conception. Early-pregnancy-test.com. When I got pregnant with my first daughter, I was able to tell at 2 1/2 weeks. But I had to do the test first thing in the morning.
