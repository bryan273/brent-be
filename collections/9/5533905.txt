Hi! Yes, hoarseness of voice and sore throat are common side effects of flovent. This will persist as long as you use the drug and will go away after that. If you also develop breathlessness or choking with it please discontinue immediately and take an anti-allergic pill. If the doctor is not available, see if you can contact someone from her clinic or any other doctor filling in for her. Until then, if the hoarseness is not too troublesome then you can continue flovent otherwise if the hoarseness is progressing then please stop it immediately.
