The only sex problem that did not respond to Wellbutrin was the men’s premature ejaculation. In addition to overall improvement in their sexual functioning, one woman reported the first orgasm of her life, and another woman experienced her first multiple orgasms.nfortunately, few people know that another antidepressant, Wellbutrin (chemical name: bupropion), is as effective as the SSRIs — but much less likely to cause sexual side effects. And most don’t know that several studies have shown that Wellbutrin has sex-enhancing effects.
