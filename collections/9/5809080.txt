Dr Matt A. Morgan â—‰ et al. Blind loop syndrome (or blind pouch syndrome) is an event that may occur after an end-to-end or end-to-side bowel anastomosis. Dilatation and stasis of the bypassed bowel may lead to bacterial overgrowth, breakdown of bile salts, and result in nutritional problems. It may even eventually lead to mucosal ulceration.
