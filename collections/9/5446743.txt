Bruxism is the technical term for grinding teeth and clenching jaws. Although it can be caused by sleep disorders, an abnormal bite or teeth that are missing or crooked, it can also be caused by stress and anxiety. Nervous tension, anger and frustration can cause people to start showing the signs of bruxism without even knowing it. Because people are often not aware that they grind their teeth, it's important to know the signs and to seek treatment if you suspect you may have bruxism.
