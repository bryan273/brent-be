Floaters can be caused by normal aging of the eye when the vitreous jelly begins to shrink. Other causes of floaters include the sudden release of blood cells from the retinal blood vessels or pigmented cells from underneath the retina into the vitreous jelly. This can occur with the tearing of the retina.
