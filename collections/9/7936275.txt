When the airway is blocked, the blood absorbs the air inside the air sacs (alveoli). Without more air, the sac shrinks. The space where the lung was before the collapse fills up with blood cells, fluids and mucus. It may then become infected. Other factors can lead to a collapsed lung include: A plug of mucus, a tumor or something breathed into the lungs.
