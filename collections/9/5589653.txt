Part 3 Boil Lobster. Place the lobster tails in the water or court bouillon. Turn the burner down to medium or medium high to maintain a simmer, rather than a boil. Boil the lobster 1 minute for each oz. (28g). Most lobster tails require between 5 and 12 minutes. 4. Poke at the lobster meat with a fork. If it feels tender and the shell is brighter, they are done. 5. Remove the lobster tails from the water.
