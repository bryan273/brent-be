How cold is liquid nitrogen? Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen exists as a liquid between the temperatures of -210°C and -196°C which equals -346°F and -320.44°F. Below -210°C, nitrogen freezes and becomes a solid. Above -196°C, nitrogen boils and becomes a gas. Liquid nitrogen stored in unpressurized conatainers like the tanks sold here is slowly boiling away, so the temperature is -196°C or -320.44°F.
