Multiple sclerosis is an example of a chronic condition that can result in tingling of the face. Neuropathy, or nerve damage, can be due to a number of specific diseases and disorders. In many cases, neuropathy has no known cause. In rare cases, if the tingling face is accompanied by numbness or weakness of the arms or legs on one side of the body, it can be a sign of stroke. Tingling of the face can also result from injury or, rarely, tumors of the brain or nerves.
