Eating certain foods also helps. This includes eating dark chocolates, garlic, and bananas. Dark chocolates have large quantities of cocoa â€“ the flavonoids in the cocoa help with lowering your blood pressure. Bananas, on the other hand, have potassium which helps regulate your heart beat and improve blood circulation.
