March 22, 2002 -- Two glasses of orange juice a day lowers blood pressure, a new study suggests. It doesn't mean that OJ is the cure for what ails you.It does mean that a good diet is crucial -- especially for heart patients.High blood pressure isn't good for anybody.he blood-pressure decrease we saw is definitely clinically relevant, says Carla McGill, PhD, RD, a nutrition scientist at Tropicana. If we could reduce blood pressure by this much it would be very good for all patients.. At the end of the study, the patients stopped drinking orange juice for two weeks.
