Cortisol is a powerful anti-inflammatory hormone, so you might think that high levels of it would protect us from inflammatory diseases like arthritis and heart disease. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Cortisol and cortisol-like medicines suppress inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. That makes us more susceptible to new infections, and sooner or later we will get them. The new infections will raise our inflammation and cortisol levels, making us susceptible to still more infections. And so on.
