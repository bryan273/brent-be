Lipomas are soft, fatty lumps that grow under the skin. They're harmless and can usually be left alone if they're small and painless. Lipomas are non-cancerous (benign) and are caused by an overgrowth of fat cells. They can grow anywhere in the body where there are fat cells, but are usually seen on the: shoulders. neck. chest. arms. back. buttock.
