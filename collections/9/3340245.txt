Sudden hearing loss is associated with vertigo in between 20 to 60% of patients (Rambold et al, 2005). The wide spread probably depends on what you define as vertigo -- a little bit of dizziness, or a profound sensation of rotation. Patients with vertigo also usually have worse hearing (Niu et al, 2015).
