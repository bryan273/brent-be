Certain viruses or bacteria can infect the larynx and cause it to swell. Usually, the virus comes from another illness, such as a cold, the flu, or bronchitis. Laryngitis can also occur from using the voice too much (singing or shouting). Chronic laryngitis can be caused by heavy smoking, excessive alcohol use, or acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), caused when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus.
