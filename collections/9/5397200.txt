Rabbit Gestation | Breeding Rabbits. The average gestation period for rabbits is 31 days; however, it can vary from 29 to 35 days. Does should be pregnancy-checked 14 days after mating. If not pregnant, they can be re-bred immediately. If a doe exhibits kindling (or birthing) tendency 18 to 22 days after mating, it is a good sign of false pregnancy.
