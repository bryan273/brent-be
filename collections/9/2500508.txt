Vitamin E to Treat Uveitis-Associated Macular Edema. This study has been completed. This study will evaluate whether vitamin E can help treat swelling of the macular area of the retina (the back part of the eye) associated with uveitis (inflammatory eye disease). The macula is responsible for sharp vision; swelling in this area is one cause of vision loss in uveitis patients.
