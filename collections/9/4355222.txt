There are numerous possible reasons for your dog's itchy skin. Your pooch is scratching his ears, neck and belly. He scratches constantly, but you can't figure out why. A number of culprits can make your pooch itch -- food allergies, environmental allergens, fleas and even dog shampoo. Regardless of breed or age, any dog at anytime can have an allergic reaction to his dog food. Lower-quality dog foods contain corn, wheat and soy products that can cause itchy skin.
