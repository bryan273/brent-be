The early stage of shingles -- called the prodromal stage -- begins 3 to 4 days before the rash appears. Early symptoms resemble those of the common cold, including headache, nausea, general achiness, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and chills. As shingles progresses, more severe symptoms begin to develop. The next stage of shingles is called the eruptive stage. Pain is usually the first symptom. For some, it can be excruciating and may include burning, itching, numbness or tingling in the area where the rash will form. The pain may be felt penetrating from front to back, especially in the chest or face.
