Eat 4-5 servings of vegetables a day. Vegetables provide you with the vitamins you need to lower your blood pressure, as well as valuable dietary fiber, and minerals such as potassium and magnesium. To increase the amount of vegetables in your diet, incorporate them into your main dish instead of only eating them on the side.
