Secondary Growth in Roots Secondary growth occurs in many roots and usually results in the thickening of the root diameter by the addition ofvascular tissue.Initiation of secondary growth occurs when cells in the residual procambium and parts of the pericyle begin to make periclinal divisions.Only the pericyle cells opposite the xylem points start to make periclinal divisions. The inner layer of cells becomes the vascular cambium.nitiation of secondary growth occurs when cells in the residual procambium and parts of the pericyle begin to make periclinal divisions.
