Secondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural, causes. Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding.
