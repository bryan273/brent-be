Yet another reason dogs vomit white foam is because of kennel cough, which is an upper respiratory infection that is contracted from other dogs. Dogs suffering from kennel cough have a dry cough and experience flu-like symptoms, such as nasal discharge, sneezing and fever. Finally, vomiting white foam is a sign of rabies as well. The foaming around the mouth is caused by nerve damage around the mouth and throat, which prevents the dog from swallowing. However, dogs do not begin exhibiting this symptom until the later stages of the disease.
