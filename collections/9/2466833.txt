If you are pregnant, by then the levels of hormone may be high enough to be picked up by the test. A blood test can also detect hCG. Blood tests are more sensitive than urine tests and may detect pregnancy from about six days to eight days after ovulation. However, your GP wonâ€™t suggest a blood test for pregnancy until after your period is due, and only if there is a medical need.
