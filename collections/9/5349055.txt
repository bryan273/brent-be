Some seeing eye dogs are selected from breeders specifically because they possess a certain temperament that is required of service dogs. However, many seeing eye dogs are rescued from animal shelters. All dogs who enter the training program to become seeing eye dogs must past a series of rigorous personality tests. If the dog passes the tests, they are then taken to a training facility.
