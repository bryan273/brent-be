An example of a strong acid is hydrochloric acid. A strong acid has a pH of 1. hydrogen chloride (in water) hydrogen ion + chloride ion HCl(aq) H+(aq) + Cl-(aq). All of the hydrogen chloride molecules become hydrogen ions and chloride ions when they are dissolved in water (see examples of other strong acids).
