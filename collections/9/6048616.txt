Although it is well-established that night sweats are a common symptom of Hodgkin's lymphoma, the reason for this remains unclear. However, it is important to keep in mind that another of the B symptoms associated with Hodgkin's is persistent fevers. It has been postulated that the fevers one experiences with Hodgkin's may be causing the night sweats, similar to when you have the flu and your fever breaks overnight.
