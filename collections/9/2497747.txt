Enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by infection, immune disorders or cancer. Skin tumors around the neck region can also cause the appearance of a swollen neck. If your dog is also chewing at her skin it may mean that the swelling and the itching are due to an underlying allergy or skin infection. Some pets are allergic to their collars which can appear as a circular area of hair loss and irritation around the neck.
