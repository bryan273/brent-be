Home remedy medications for diarrhea should be used with caution. Young kittens with severe diarrhea should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Loperamide (Imodium AD TM) liquid can be used in cats for diarrhea. The usual dosage for cats is 0.1 to 0.2mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours. (1 kg = 2.2 pounds.) It is OK to try this for 1-2 days but if there is no response you should have the cat and especially kittens examined / rechecked .
