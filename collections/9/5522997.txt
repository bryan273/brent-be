Common Questions and Answers about Flomax dry mouth. I also have many of the other bad side effects, increased pulse, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, and quit a bit others. Has anyone else had these issues and could I possibly not have BPH but some other condition? Any insight would be great, thank you in advance.
