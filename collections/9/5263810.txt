All you have to do to find out if you have chlamydia or gonorrhea is give a urine sample – it's totally painless. Syphilis, hepatitis and herpes are tested from a blood sample, unless you have an open sore – then the syphilis and herpes tests are gathered from rubbing a cu-tip on the sore. You will receive the results of your STD test back within 7 to 10 days.
