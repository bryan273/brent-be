It can be dangerous to be operating machinery or driving when you have a seizure. You cannot swallow your tongue during seizures. But you can choke on food, vomit, or an object in your mouth. Some seizures may place temporary but severe stress on the body and cause problems with the muscles, lungs, or heart. Choking, an abnormal heartbeat, or other problems may cause sudden death, though this is rare. Untreated seizures that become more severe or frequent may lead to these problems. One of the most dangerous complications of epilepsy is a prolonged seizure condition that can result in brain damage or death called status epilepticus. WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise.
