Understanding How Early Result Pregnancy Tests Work. Early results tests promise results three or four days before your missed period. These tests assume a 14-day luteal phase, the time between ovulation and when you get your period. The problem is that you may have a shorter or longer luteal phase. If your luteal phase is usually 12 days, four days before your missed period would be nine days after ovulation. That's way too early to test. For you, taking the test four days before your missed period would be pointless. If you have a luteal phase of 15 days, four days before your missed period is 12 days after ovulation. You still may not have enough hormone that early, but youâ€™ve got a better chance than someone with a shorter luteal phase.
