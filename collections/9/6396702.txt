Don't eat junk food when you have a cold or flu. When you have a cold or flu your body is under a lot of stress, fighting the viral infection. Big, heavy meals take vital energy to digest, resources which your body could be using to fight the infections. An old saying states Feed a cold and starve a fever. A better saying is Starve a cold and starve a fever. The best thing to do is drink plenty of liquids-water, fruit juices and if needed soups, but stay away from heavy and highly processed food. High liquid intake is important as the body uses water to carry waste products and toxins to your elimination systems.
