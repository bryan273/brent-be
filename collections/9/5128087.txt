By Mayo Clinic Staff. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In many people, it's marked by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like whoop.. Before the vaccine was developed, whooping cough was considered a childhood disease.
