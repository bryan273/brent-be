Get cold finger foods for your next party or holiday gathering from Taste of Home. Cap off this speedy supper with Chocolate Cream Fruit Dip created by Debbie Bond of Richwood, West Virginia. The thick sweet mixture has a mild chocolate flavor that's especially good on strawberries. This recipe is truly an accident, Debbie admits. While hosting a graduation party, I realized I'd forgotten the fruit dip. So I raided my cabinets and slapped this combination together.
