Best disease is an eye condition that affects a tiny part of the retina at the back of your eye, which is called the macula. Best disease can start to cause changes at the back of the eye between the ages of 3 to 15 although it does not usually affect vision until later on in life.way from the central macula is the peripheral retina, composed mostly of the other type of photoreceptor cells called rod cells. They enable us to see when light is dim and provide peripheral (side) vision outside of the main line of sight.
