* My, which means muscle. * Algia, which means pain. Fibromyalgia is a common medical condition that can involve discomfort all over the body. It can also involve other symptoms such as chronic tiredness and lack of concentration that can make life for the individual uncomfortable. Some people may be tempted to use alcohol as a means of escaping the discomfort. This is never a good idea because drinking can actually exacerbate the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
