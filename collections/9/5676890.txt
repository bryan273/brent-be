For some people, the problem is too much acid. For example, if you eat a lot of sugars, unhealthy fats, and heavy foods, more acid is needed to break them down in the stomach. If you add coffee on top, you’re adding more acidity and risk acid indigestion or heartburn. Alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco products are often considered triggers, especially when consumed in excess. But high acidity can also be caused if you don’t have enough healthy acids in your diet.
