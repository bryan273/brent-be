WASHINGTON Mom-to-be closing in on her due date? The nation's obstetricians are getting more precise about exactly how close makes for a full-term pregnancy. On average, a pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, counting from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period. That's how a due date is estimated. A baby is considered preterm if he or she is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Until now, a term baby was defined as one born anytime from 37 weeks to 42 weeks, a few weeks before or after the calculated due date.
