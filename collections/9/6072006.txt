Some of the blood in the sclera has turned yellow, like a bruise. Subconjunctival hemorrhage, also known as subconjunctival haemorrhage and hyposphagma, is bleeding underneath the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva contains many small, fragile blood vessels that are easily ruptured or broken. When this happens, blood leaks into the space between the conjunctiva and sclera. Such a hemorrhage may be caused by a sudden or severe sneeze or cough, or due to hypertension or as a side effect of blood thinners.
