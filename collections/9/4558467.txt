Migraines and cluster headaches are vascular headaches, while tension headaches are not. Cluster headaches are called that because they occur more in clusters and then go away. They usually occur in the exact same spot, and the person often experiences unilateral facial sweating and abnormal facial sensation. Cluster headaches are treated with the same medications that are given for migraine headaches. Tension headaches are not vascular headaches. They don't have that pounding nature. There is more of a constant ache, and often the neck or the sides of the head are involved.
