Well, the tooth can continue to decay, which could result in the loss of the tooth and possibly the need for a root canal. I would go ahead and get it filled. Not all fillings are silver. They do have fillings that are closer to natural tooth colors. You can tell your dentist that you don't want that ugly silver thing.
