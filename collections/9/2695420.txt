I don't know how much help I can be, but you'll probably be aware that Superdry sizes are a bit on the 'small' side. I guess it all depends on how big your 12 year old is! I'm an XL man and I can't fit into any Superdry clothing!!!!!!!!!!!uperdry mens small size. shanecr5y, 8m agoPosted 5 years, 8 months ago. Can anyone tell me before i go wasting money, would a superdry mens jacket or hoody in small size suit an average sized 12yr old boy? Tags: 1  Superdry.
