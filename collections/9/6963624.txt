What some of these subcontractors of all tiers generally do, sometimes only after prodding by insurance agents/brokers, is to purchase a policy of their own covering their work. The type of coverage commonly suggested by producers is the installation floater. An installation floater is an inland marine-type coverage that can be defined as insurance purchased by contractors to cover not only their own property but also property of others that is to be installed into a building or structure.
