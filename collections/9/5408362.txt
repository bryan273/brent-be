It aids in digestion by storing bile, a fluid made by the liver that helps in the digestion of fats. When you eat a meal, your gallbladder contracts to release the bile into the small intestine where it helps to digest fat you have consumed in foods. A second function of the gallbladder is to concentrate bile so that it can store more of it. Your gallbladder can hold up to about 50 milliliters of bile at a time. However, your liver produces between 250 to 1,000 milliliters of bile per day, depending on what you eat. By making the bile more concentrated, the gallbladder can store more of it so that the bile is ready when you need it to digest food.
