Birth defects (or congenital defects) are defects in a baby at birth, or which develop in the first month of life. There are two main types of congenital defect. The first is caused by genetic abnormalities, which are hereditary. The second is caused by conditions (such as infectious diseases) which a baby gets from its mother. Sometimes doctors can find out that a baby has a congenital disorder before its birth.
