Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is rare, but it can be life-threatening, so itâ€™s important to know its signs and symptoms so you can spot it and treat it quickly. Since TSS puts out toxins into your bloodstream, it can affect many different systems in your body at once. The symptoms are a lot like ones you might see from other kinds of infections: swelling, fever, redness, and a general feeling of being unwell. TSS symptoms usually come on quickly, about 2 days after the bacteria infects you.
