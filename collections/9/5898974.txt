A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance (usually another drug) affects the activity of a drug when both are administered together.he opposite effect to synergy is termed antagonism. Two drugs are antagonistic when their interaction causes a decrease in the effects of one or both of the drugs. Both synergy and antagonism can both occur during different phases of the interaction of a drug with an organism, with each effect having a different name.
