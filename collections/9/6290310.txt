An initial vaccination is followed by a booster vaccine 2 to 4 weeks later (in accordance with label recommendations) and annual boosters as long as the risk for disease exposure remains. Even dogs that receive year-round tick control products and donâ€™t spend a lot of time outside may be at risk for exposure to tick-borne diseases. 2  The Lyme disease vaccine helps prevent disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease organism.
