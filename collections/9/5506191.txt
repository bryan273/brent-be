If caused by a virus, pink eye gets better over time with or without treatment. When care is taken to prevent its spread and follow-up is done, pink eye clears up with no long-term problems. Pink eye (viral conjunctivitis) usually goes away in 10-14 days, but symptoms may last for up to six weeks. Damage to the cornea (the clear covering over the iris) may occur if severe infections are not treated.
