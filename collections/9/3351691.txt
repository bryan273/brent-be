Morning sickness is one of the best-known (and most obvious!) symptoms of pregnancy. â€œMorning sickness often starts from 6 weeks - around two weeks after you miss your period, explains GP Dr Philippa Kaye. But some women can feel nauseous as early as 2-3 weeks, and for many it's one of the first symptoms of their pregnancy. Of course, no two women are the same and neither are any two pregnancies.
