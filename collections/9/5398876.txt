My daughter was diagonsed with croup last week her nose is stll runny her bark cough is gone but still has a cough how long will this last? She is six. Croup: Croup is usually self-limiting, lasting 5-7 days, but as with any other respiratory infections, cough is usually the last symptom to go away.
