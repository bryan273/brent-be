An asynchronous procedure call (APC) is a function that executes asynchronously in the context of a particular thread. When an APC is queued to a thread, the system issues a software interrupt.The next time the thread is scheduled, it will run the APC function.n APC generated by the system is called a kernel-mode APC. An APC generated by an application is called a user-mode APC. A thread must be in an alertable state to run a user-mode APC. Each thread has its own APC queue.
