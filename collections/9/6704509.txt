Foot cramps have many causes. Some of the most common causes for foot cramps are: Stress or fatigue in the foot – An overworked foot is often susceptible to foot cramps. Poor circulation – Foot cramp is caused by lack of oxygen being carried to the foot. Lack of potassium – This important mineral, found in salt, helps regulate body chemistry and keep you foot cramp free. Dehydration – Lack of water in the muscles contribute to foot cramps. Changing hormone levels – Foot cramps may occur while muscle tissue adjusts to these changes. Pinched nerves – Caused when the electrical impulse from the brain cannot reach the muscle, this can cause foot cramps, numbness and other symptoms.
