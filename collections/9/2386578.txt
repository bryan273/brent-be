Load up on potassium. Aim for 4,700 milligrams a day. Foods rich in potassium help your blood pressure naturally fall, and bananas arenâ€™t the only option. One cup of tomato paste provides 2,657 milligrams; a cup of bok choy provides 631 milligrams; and one cup of Brussels sprouts provides 495 milligrams, for example.
