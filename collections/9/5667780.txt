If your pregnancy has been straightforward, youâ€™re likely to be offered induction at 41 weeks (NCCWCH 2008a) . The timing may vary according to your hospital's policy. In some areas you may be offered an induction at between seven days and 10 days after your due date, in others it may be two weeks.owever, many maternity units have a policy of inducing labour before 42 weeks, so in the UK, only about three per cent of babies are born after 42 weeks (HSCIC 2015) . If you're only a few days past your due date, most doctors won't offer to induce your labour for a while.
