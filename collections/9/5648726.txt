Unfortunately, not all rhinoplasty procedures have an ideal outcome. Sometimes, the structural integrity of the nose is compromised during the procedure, which can later on cause problems contributing to a crooked nose. Poor healing can also have an impact on the problem. Many of these problems can be avoided by choosing the right surgeon and practicing diligent aftercare.
