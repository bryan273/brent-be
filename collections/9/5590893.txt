The throat may feel raw or tickle. Symptoms vary with the severity of the inflammation. Severe infections may result in fever, general malaise, and a sore throat. Bacterial infections like strep throat, and irritation from alcohol or toxic vapors, dust and smoke, and even hot beverages can cause laryngitis. Hay fever and other allergies can also cause vocal changes, including hoarseness or loss of voice.
