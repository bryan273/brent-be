Complimenting past findings, recent research reveals that drinking a single glass of beetjuice juice daily may just be enough to lower blood pressure in those suffering from hypertension. In fact, this simple juice can lead to a ‘significant’ reduction in blood pressure. For the research, Amrita Ahluwalia, a vascular pharmacology professor at QMUL, and her research team analyzed the effects of both beetroot juice and a placebo on 64 individuals aged 18-85.
