Is bleeding navel common? As a matter of fact, bleeding navel is not a common issue. Hence, any bleeding or discharge coming from the belly button should be an indication of an infection. Mostly, bleeding navels are triggered by improper wound healing after a belly button piercing. Unhygienic instruments and careless post-piercing wound care are two most common reasons for a belly button infection.
