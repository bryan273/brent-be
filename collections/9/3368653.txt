Most lung cancers do not cause any symptoms until they have spread, but some people with early lung cancer do have symptoms. 1  If you go to your doctor when you first notice symptoms, your cancer might be diagnosed at an earlier stage, when treatment is more likely to be effective. The most common symptoms of lung cancer are: 1  A cough that does not go away or gets worse. 2  Coughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm) 3  Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing. 4  Hoarseness. 5  Weight loss and loss of appetite. 6  Shortness of breath. 7  Feeling tired or weak.
