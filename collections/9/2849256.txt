This is what is commonly known as a herniated disc. (Also called a slipped disc, bulging disc, disc protrusion, etc.). Not all herniated discs cause pain or discomfort. It is when the bulge puts pressure on the exiting spinal nerve that pain, or an inflammatory reaction, will occur. It is therefore very important to have a full understanding of what is causing the pain.
