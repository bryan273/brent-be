Biological Factors in Obesity. Overview. Obesity is an extremely common disorder in many societiesâ€”both industrial and preindustrial. Like many other pathological conditions, obesity results from a combination of biological, psychological/behavioral, behavioral, and social factors. It is at times very difficult to separate physical findings that are a complication of obesity, rather than a biological factor underlying it.
