Heart attacks occur when the heartâ€™s oxygen supply gets cut off, which is usually caused by blockages in the cardiac arteries that feed the heart oxygen-rich blood. When you have a heart attack, tissue in the heart can die. However, your heart usually keeps on beating. Cough CPR is ineffective for heart attacks. During cardiac arrest, your heart suddenly stops beating. Serious irregularity in the heartbeat (arrhythmia) can cause this.
