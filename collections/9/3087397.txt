A role for vitamin D in inflammation is supported by studies in laboratory animals. In particular, mice lacking the vitamin D receptor or the vitamin D activating enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase, have increased susceptibility to inflammation, especially inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (61-63).
