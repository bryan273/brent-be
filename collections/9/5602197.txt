Best Answer: This article says a typical cinder block weights approximately 26-33 pounds. Based on my recollection, that seems to be correct. I know it's way more than 9 pounds... The concrete commonly used to make concrete blocks is a mixture of powdered portland cement, water, sand, and gravel. This produces a light gray block with a fine surface texture and a high compressive strength. A typical concrete block weighs 38-43 lb (17.2-19.5 kg).
