How long does bacteriostatic water last once it is used? Hospira recommends that once a vial of Bacteriostatic water is open the preservatives will prolong its life for up to 28 days. After 28 days the vial needs to be discarded. Other injectables without the bacteriostatic agent (single-dose vials) should be discarded after one single use.
