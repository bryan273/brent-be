Intertrigo frequently is worsened or colonized by infection, which most commonly is candidal but also may be bacterial or viral or due to other fungal infection. Intertrigo commonly affects the axilla, perineum, inframammary creases, and abdominal folds, and it can also affect the neck creases and interdigital areas.
