Fasting known for hundreds of years as one of the methods to release toxins and loose weight and bring body to its normal healthy state. To loose weight you should fast once a week 24-36 hours. Drink water with lemon juice and a little raw honey(if you feel exhausted). I tested this method. It works. But one thing before testing you should clean up your guts by taking 2-3 pills of senna or castor oil (2-3 tablespoons).If you have some comments you can email me at cureyourself@mail2expert.com.
