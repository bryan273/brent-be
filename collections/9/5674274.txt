Intertrigo is primarily caused by skin-on-skin friction and is characterized by initial mild erythema that may progress to a more intense inflammation with erosions, oozing, exudation, maceration, and crusting.3 Intertrigo is facilitated by moisture trapped in deep skinfolds where air circulation is limited.
