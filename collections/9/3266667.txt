1. Head and Shoulders Soft and Silky. The shampoo that I use daily is actually one of the best out there of all shampoos for dry scalp. This shampoo keeps my hair, which is especially prone to being dry and flaky due to its thick, coarse texture, soft all year round. Head and Shoulders Soft and Silky also fights dandruff and contains special conditioners.
