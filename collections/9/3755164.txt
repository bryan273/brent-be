An orthopedic doctor is a board certified M.D. who specializes in problems - from head to toes - of the musculoskeletal system. This includes, of course, the spine. An orthopedist might address conditions such as ruptured discs, scoliosis or other types of neck or low back pain. Some of the procedures performed by orthopedic surgeons can also be done by neurosurgeons (see below.) Examples of such surgeries include spinal fusion, discectomies and more.
