Optic nerve swelling due to inflammation is called optic neuritis. Optic neuritis may be the first sign of an autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis. It can also be caused by certain infections, including measles, mumps, chicken pox, shingles, Lyme disease, cat scratch fever, meningitis and syphilis.
