THROAT-­CLEARING COUGH. It feels like you have a lump in your throat and coughing leaves you with a nasty, bitter taste in the mouth. The cough can be ­triggered by talking, laughing, singing or eating particularly dry food. It also tends to occur at night. CAUSE: The most likely cause is stomach acid splashing up the ­gullet — this affects about 25 per cent of the adult Western ­population and is known as reflux.
