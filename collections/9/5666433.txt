Multiple factors may cause canker sores, including injury to the mouth, acidic or spicy foods, vitamin deficiencies, hormones, stress, or autoimmune disorders. Canker sores are not the same thing as fever blisters (cold sores). Most canker sores require no treatment and heal on their own. To help relieve pain and speed healing, treatments and home remedies for canker sores include topical medications, mouthwashes, and over-the-counter pain medications.
