In the stomach, food tends to hang around for a little longer and this depends on a variety of factors including the amount of food you have consumed, how much fat it contains, and also the acidity of the stomach. However, all food should have left the stomach within 2 to 4 hours. It takes approximately seven seconds. Chew slowly! It usually takes a few minutes for the food to get to yo â€¦ ur stomach. But the digestion process is much longer. For instance, a cheeseburger may get to your stomach within 6-10 Minutes, but it will take 24 Hours to digest the whole thing.
