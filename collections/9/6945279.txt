Your body takes time to break down the fat and protein in order to absorb it, so the nutrients don't reach your muscles for a while after eating. With protein shakes, on the other hand, you can get fast-acting proteins (whey protein chief among them) that are easily absorbed into your body with little to no wait time. You can also find proteins that are absorbed slowly into your body, giving you a steady supply of amino acids overnight or all day long. That is one of the main advantages of using protein shakes to build muscle: you can select the type of protein you want.
