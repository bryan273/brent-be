Can I get struck by lightning when I'm indoors? Over 1,000 people get struck by lightning every year in the United States, and over 100 of them die as a result of the strike. Lightning is a very d­angerous force that, yes, can even reach you indoors if you're in contact with the telephone or plumbing. ­If lightning strikes the phone line outside your house, the strike will travel to every phone on the line -- and potentially to you if you are holding the phone.
