Make the water deep enough to cover the crab. Bring the water to a roiling boil and place the frozen crab inside. Keep heat on high to maintain the boil--adjust lower if it looks like it is going to boil over. Foam may form--scoop it out with a ladle or lower the heat and leave the top off. Boil for about 12 minutes.
