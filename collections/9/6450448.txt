At that point, the power required by the motor is constant. A generator can supply an additional amount of power for a short period of time to get a motor started. There is more information in this article. You can use the Running Watts to know the max amount of load you can connect to the generator. While you can use the Starting Watts to consider for the loads(reactive loads) that require an extra amount of power(for a short time) than they normally consume in order to start (i.e a motor, refrigerator).
