Henry Cow's second release, Unrest, is a little harder to get into right away, as most of the well-orchestrated Jazz stylings from the first have been put on the back burner, making way for a more experimental, improvised approach to the music. The first song, ''Bitter Storm Over Ulm'', is quirky, fun and short.
