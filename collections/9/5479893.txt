If you need to wear a pad, then it is considered bleeding. Spotting at its heaviest is like the very very end of your period. My doctor told me anytime I have spotting he needs to be notified. Based on your question, it sounds like you are having more than spotting, which could be dangerous. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room to make sure everything is ok.
