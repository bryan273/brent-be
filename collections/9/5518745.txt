Healthy adults aged over 40 should have their blood pressure checked at least once every five years. If you are at an increased risk of high blood pressure, you should have your blood pressure checked more often, ideally once a year. You can ask for a blood pressure check â€“ you don't have to wait to be offered one. Blood pressure testing is also part of the NHS Health Check for adults aged 40-74.
