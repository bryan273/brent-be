In 1927, the first iron lung was installed at Bellevue hospital in New York City. The first patients of the iron lung were polio patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles. Later John Emerson simplified Philip Drinker’s invention and reduced the manufacturing costs. An iron lung has ‘port holes’ along both sides that allow access to the patient for medical needs and personal care. When an arm is inserted through these ‘port holes’ a rubber gasket provides an air tight seal. The bed of the iron lung can also slide forward to allow complete access to the patient. An iron lung, or tank respirator, is a very gentle means of providing breathing assistance. Because of its bulk the iron lung has been largely replaced with units that are smaller and portable.
