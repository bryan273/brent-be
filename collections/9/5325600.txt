Best Answer: Generally, men will be affected more by sex-linked genetic disorders, but of course there are lots of different factors that come into play, and this isn't just a simple hard and fast rule. The most common type of sex-linked condition is a recessive X-linked condition. Other sex-linked conditions may be dominant X-linked, or Y-linked. As recessive X-linked disorders are the most common of the 3 though, I'll explain the theory behind why men are affected more. Men have the sex chromosomes X and Y (one copy of each).
