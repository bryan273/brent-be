You can apply a heat pack on your tummy if you are experiencing cramps. An electric heating pad will help. You can also take a warm bath in a tub to ease the pain. If the pain cannot be self-treated, it is time to go to the doctor for a medical examination. Your cramps may be a manifestation of a more serious health problem. Changing your diet and lifestyle can also help prevent cramp attacks in the future.
