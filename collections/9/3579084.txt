Pink Eye is also known as Conjunctivitis or Madras eye. It is the inflammation of the inner surface of the eyelid, or the outer layer of the eye. The diffused pinkness of the transparent membranes, or conjunctiva, is what has given this inflammation its common name. Pink Eye is often caused by an infection or by an allergic reaction and the membranes react.
