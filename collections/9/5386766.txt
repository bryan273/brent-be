Tracheoesophageal fistula is also known as TE fistula or simply TEF. TE fistula is a birth defect, which is an abnormality that occurs as a fetus is forming in its mother's uterus. When a baby with a TE fistula swallows, the liquid can pass through the abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea.
