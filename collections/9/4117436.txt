Take note if the trembling accompanies any of these. If you suspect your diet, avoid eating simple carbs without protein at meals. If your sugar drops and you shake, eat or drink something sweet, like orange juice. If the shaking stops, low blood sugar is the most likely cause. Then, eat some protein to avoid a recurrence. At the onset of shakiness, evaluate whether you've slept well, eaten in last four hours or experienced something that caused you to feel anxious. Check your thermostat to see if the setting is too low.
