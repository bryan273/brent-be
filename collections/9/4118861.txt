Tea tree oil is one of the best natural methods for skin tag removal at home. Soak a cotton ball in water and then, put at least 2-3 drops of tea tree oil on it. Now, lightly rub it over the skin tag in circular motions. Repeat this daily at least twice a day for about a week until the skin tag completely vanishes.
