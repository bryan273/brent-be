you have to ice them ice is the best way to reduce swelling. Quit eating any salt for a few days. Put your feet up level with your heart for at least 4 hours at a time at least 3 times during 24 hours. (or somehow keep your feet up 12 hours out of 24 including sleep.) Rub with epsom salt, which should draw the water out of your feet. If you have a water pill (diruetic) take one.
