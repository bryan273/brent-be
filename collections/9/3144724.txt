Lewy Body Dementia (also called Dementia with Lewy bodies) is a form of dementia that shares characteristics with both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies are abnormal aggregates of protein that develop inside nerve cells in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and some other disorders.
