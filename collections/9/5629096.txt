LDX: that’s ridiculous, if you don’t have adhd get off the vyvanse. I honestly don’t see why anyone who wanted to abuse an amphetamine would take vyvanse, because of it’s delivery you Don’t get any kind of rush or euphoria or energy, it just helps me concentrate. I Love being able to concentrate Without feeling wired.
