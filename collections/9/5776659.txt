High-protein, low-carb vegan foods to add to your grocery list include tofu, seitan, soy milk, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and almonds.ost nuts and seeds contain about 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of carbs per ounce. If you follow a lacto-vegetarian diet, you can add cottage cheese and reduced-fat cheese to your low-carb grocery list, and if you follow an ovo-vegetarian diet you should add eggs to your list.
