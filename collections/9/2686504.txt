When a roof begins to leak, it may need to be replaced. However, on an otherwise sturdy roof, a repair of a small area may be all that is needed. Typical costs: Repairing a 10x10-foot square of asphalt shingles, considered one square of roofing, runs $100-$350 using a roofing company. Repairing a few missing or broken asphalt shingles through a handyman service runs $95-$127. Reparing wooden shingles using a roofing company for a 10x10-foot square costs $210-$1,000.
