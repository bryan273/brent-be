• Gastritis refers to inflammation of the gastric mucosa, whereas gastropathy is a nonspecific microscopic injury pattern with little or no inflammatory cell infiltration. • Gastritis and gastropathy are associated with a wide range of aetiologies (causes). • Gastritis is divided into acute and chronic forms. • The commonest form of acute gastritis is acute haemorrhagic gastritis. • Helicobacter-associated and autoimmune gastritis are the commonest types of chronic gastritis.
