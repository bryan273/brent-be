HCG levels are associated with problems of the thyroid and supplementing HCG hasn't been proved to be a safe treatment. HCG levels only have a weak effect on the thyroid gland and hypothyroidism and HCG levels don't have a strong connection in terms of weight loss. HCG supplements are probably broken down and digested.
