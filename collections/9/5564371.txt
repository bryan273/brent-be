Report Abuse. I just had an abscessed tooth extracted and it cost me over $1000!! Yeah, I was put to sleep, but it s not like I wanted to rent his office or nothing! And something was done to my throat because afterwards I couldn t breathe well and kept having to cough. had to have a tooth out today-it cost $200 all up. That included an x-ray too. They just numbed the whole area big time, a bit of pressure and pulling and it was out.
