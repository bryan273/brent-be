Shock Top Wheat IPA | Anheuser-Busch. Shock Top Wheat IPA is no traditional beer. Itâ€™s a unique hybrid that combines the fresh flavor and smoothness of wheat beer with the crisp hop bitterness of an IPA. The result is a beer that is truly like no other. To serve, pour down the side of the glass until a half inch is left in the bottle.
