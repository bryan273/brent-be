Recurring Cold & Flu Symptoms. Hi, I've been struggling for the last 5 weeks with recurring cold & flu symptoms, a lot of sneezing, now i have a cough which is quite chesty, by the weekend i feel completely drained, somtimes quite achy during the evenings. I'm taking paracetomol extra, not suffering from high temp though.
