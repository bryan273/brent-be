Both green and herbal teas can help aid in digestion and reduce or eliminate symptoms, such as bloating and gas. However, some forms of herbal tea may interact with supplements, other herbs and medication. For these reasons, check with your doctor before adding herbal teas to your diet or if you experience any side effects.
