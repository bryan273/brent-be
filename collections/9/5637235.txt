Cold symptoms typically begin with a sore throat that may be mild or severe. After a day or two, the sore throat improves and nasal symptoms, such as congestion or a runny nose, appear. Nasal secretions begin as a thin and watery discharge, then develop into a thicker and darker discharge several days into the illness.
