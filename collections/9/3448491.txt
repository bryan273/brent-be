Sinusitis vertigo and dizziness are complications of a sinus infection. Caused by bacteria, a virus, or fungus, sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are four hollow cavities in the human skull and are important parts of the immune system as they provide defense against infection. The sinuses are lined with mucous, which expels pollutants and bacteria from the body. It is common for the infection that causes colds to also affect the sinuses and can contribute to dizziness. The dizziness is a result of fluid build-up in the ears that puts pressure on the eardrum and inner ear.
