The secondary cancer is made of the same type of cells as the primary cancer. If your cancer started in your bowel and has spread to your lung, the areas of cancer in the lung are made up of bowel cancer cells. This is different from having a cancer that first started in the lung (a primary lung cancer). In that case, the cancer is made up of lung cells that have become cancerous.
