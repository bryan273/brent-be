Cleft Palate. Cleft lip and cleft palate, which can also occur together as cleft lip and palate, are variations of a type of clefting congenital deformity caused by abnormal facial development during gestation. A cleft is a fissure or openingâ€”a gap. It is the non-fusion of the body's natural structures that form before birth.
