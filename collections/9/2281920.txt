1 After treating your stomach ache (ie after drinking a soothing tea, or taking medication) sit or lie down in a comfortable position to allow all blood to flow to your stomach and listen to music. 2  It is proven that music significantly reduces pain. If you drink sugary fluids it may cause a reaction in your stomach and make the pain worse and last longer. 2  If you have gas just let it out. 3  Don't hold it in, since that just makes it worse. 4  Try to sleep, but not on your back in case you vomit in your sleep, it is better to be on your side so you don't choke.
