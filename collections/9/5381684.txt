Ask any doctor the interrelation between periods and bladder infections and the answer you will probably hear is hormonal imbalance. Secondly, lack of hygiene during periods can also cause UTI during or after periods. Wiping back to front is a habit that can definitely lead to frequent UTIs in women. Certain foods can also trigger UTI during or before one’s menstrual cycle. These include: caffeine rich food and drinks, refined flour and sugary items. Ancient Chinese herbalists usually attribute bladder infections during and after the periods to the patient’s diet.
