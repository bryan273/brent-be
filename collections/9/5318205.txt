EPP (expanded polypropylene) is a unique raw material that has many important characteristics making it suitable for a wide range of applications.Some striking selection criteria are: energy absorption, low weight and high thermal stability.hanks to the mechanical properties, EPP is extremely suitable for components that must resist pressure. The low weight, high energy absorption and good deformation properties of EPP, even after repeated shock loads, are extremely suitable properties for components in the automotive industry.
