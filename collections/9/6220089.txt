This is a new technology of tinting the optical lenses, with the tint darker for the upper part of the prescription lens, and the tint gradually becoming lighter for lower part of the lens. This arrangement makes the wearer more at ease by enjoying the better sunshade as well as the better vision acuity seeing through the lower part.
