Knee mobility exercises can begin during the pre-operative phase of ACL rehabilitation if pain allows. Mobility is most important after surgery and should begin as soon as possible within the first two weeks after surgery. Exercises should not be painful to perform. Aim to work within the pain free range of motion.
