Cause. The most common cause of boils is staphylococcus aureus bacteria entering a hair follicle of the skin. If your child has a scrape or cut, it damages the hair follicle, then the bacteria can enter deeper into the epidermis.y the time your childâ€™s boil has finished filling with pus, it can be as large as a golf ball. The boil often oozes fluid. As the boil drains, the pain subsides and the size shrinks. The areas most commonly affected by boils are the face, armpits, buttocks, thigh and armpits.
