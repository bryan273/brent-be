While open-fit hearing aids are the most popular choice of hearing aids and certainly offer many benefits, they are not for everyone. The best practice before selecting a hearing aid is to have a hearing test done by a qualified hearing healthcare provider. The best style of hearing aid for an individual depends on hearing test results, dexterity, vision, communication needs, lifestyle and what they can afford.
