Blurry vision may be experienced in one eye or in both eyes, depending upon the cause. Blurred vision can also be a symptom of numerous conditions that do not directly involve the eye, such as migraine or stroke. A number of medications may also lead to temporary blurring of vision as a side effect. Sometimes, blurred vision is associated with other symptoms, depending upon its cause, including headache, sensitivity to light, or redness and irritation of the eyes.
