Dry scalp is often itchy and may also result in flaking. When dead skin is being sloughed off the scalp, it can create a dry scalp or dandruff. This skin condition is known as seborrheic dermatitis. A moisturizing shampoo containing essential oils such as lavender oil and jojoba oil (a plant wax) may be helpful.
