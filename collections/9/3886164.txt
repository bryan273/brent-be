A paraesophageal hernia is also known as a hiatal hernia, where a portion of the stomach slides through the diaphragm and into the chest. This may cause symptoms of pain, heartburn, reflux, and difficulty swallowing food. Sometimes it causes food or even liquids to become stuck as they go down the esophagus.
