Cayenne does not dissolve easily in water, so it is hard to wash off. Use vinegar to get it off the skin. Capsaicin cream may cause an itching, burning sensation on the skin. These symptoms tend to go away quickly. Test capsaicin cream on a small area of your skin before extended use. If it causes irritation, or if your symptoms do not get better after 2 to 4 weeks, stop using it.
