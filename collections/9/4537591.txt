A cleft lip occurs when there is a split or opening in the lip. This opening can be small or large enough to connect the upper lip and nose. A cleft palate occurs when the roof of the mouth does not close properly during a baby’s early development inside the womb. The palate is made up of two parts, either of which can be cleft – the hard palate and the soft palate. The hard palate is a bony portion in the front of the roof of your mouth.
