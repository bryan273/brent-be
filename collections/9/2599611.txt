First difference between your regular period and implantation bleeding is timing. Usually your period comes every 28-30 days and if you always had regular periods, this time your period should come at the same time.But implantation bleeding could appear ONLY after fertilization-on average between 6 to 12 days past ovulation (on average about 9 days after ovulation).nly about a third of pregnan women experience implantation bleeding.Sometimes the implantation bleeding is usually spotting-it is scanty, pinkish and not red and heavy like a period. Usually it lasts 1-2 days.
