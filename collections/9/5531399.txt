The contagious period for the flu is similar. A study found you’re most contagious during a 2-3 day period after the on-set of symptoms. But just like a cold, you can still spread influenza during the entire time you’re sick - anywhere between 2 and 10 days. It’s possible to infect others one day before you feel any symptoms like a high fever, muscle aches, sinus problems and stomach issues.
