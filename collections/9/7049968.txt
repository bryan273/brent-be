OHSU researchers tested the hearing in 67 patients, ages eight months to 23 years following their chemotherapy. 61 of them were found to have hearing loss. Typically, the resulting hearing loss from cisplatin chemotherapy is high frequency hearing loss, making the hearing impairment less obvious. Children are most at risk, but the precise risk of hearing loss from cisplatin is yet to be determined.
