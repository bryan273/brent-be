When prostate cancer spreads beyond the prostate to another organ, most frequently it spreads to the bone. Prostate cancer that spread to the bone is still prostate cancer when doctors look at it under the microscope. It is still treated with therapy for prostate cancer. A man whose prostate cancer spread to the bone does not have bone cancer.
