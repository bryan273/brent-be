A mass balance, also called a material balance, is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems.By accounting for material entering and leaving a system, mass flows can be identified which might have been unknown, or difficult to measure without this technique.hen a mass balance is made for a tube, one first considers an infinitesimal part of the tube and make a mass balance over that using the ideal tank reactor model. That mass balance is then integrated over the entire reactor volume to obtain:
