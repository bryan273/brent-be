Parts of the Nervous System. The center of the nervous system is the brain. The brain takes in what your eyes see and ears hear, and if you decide that you want to move around, your brain tells your muscles to do it. Your brain makes your muscles move by sending tiny electrical signals to them through your nerves. Peripheral nervous system (PNS): a part of the nervous system which includes all the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. 2  Sympathetic nervous system: The part of your nervous system that unconsciously controls your organs and glands when you're excited or frightened.
