One advantage boiling has over straight grilling is cooking time. With a 45-minute to one-hour boil first, the spareribs will tenderize in the boil and need only go onto the grill to sear and caramelize on their exterior-- a process that only takes about 10 to 15 minutes, per side, over a medium-hot grill.
