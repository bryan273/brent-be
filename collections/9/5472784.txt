The symptoms of the Spanish flu were very similar to the symptoms of all strains of influenza viruses. It would start out with upper respiratory symptoms like runny and stuffy nose, cough, and sneezing. Then muscle and joint aches and fever would usually begin, with fevers often very high, in the area of 104 degrees F., and with marked fatigue.
