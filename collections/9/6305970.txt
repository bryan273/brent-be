Patients often return to normal activities and shoe gear by 2 weeks to 3 months depending on just how severe the toe deformity was preoperatively. Simple toe surgery can recover very quickly, and return to a shoe in two weeks – especially with the 5th toe (the 2nd toe is trickier as people push-off of this toe).Factors that may prolong healing are age, smoking, poor nutritional status, and some medical problems.he good news is that toes can be corrected. Hammer toe surgery is often synonymous with “toe shortening”, “toe job” and/or “toe augmentation”. Depending on the severity and length of the toe, there are several methods to surgically correct a hammer toe.
