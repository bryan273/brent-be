An example of a weak acid is ethanoic acid. A weak acid has a pH of 3 to 5. ethanoic acid (in water) hydrogen ion + ethanoic ion CH3CO2H(aq) H+(aq) + CH3CO2-(aq) Some of the ethanoic acid molecules become ions in water but most of them stay as molecules. The reaction is reversible (shown by the arrow).
