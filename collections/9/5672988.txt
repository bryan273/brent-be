Early in your first trimester, perhaps as early as eight weeks, you may feel dizzy and nauseous, because of low blood pressure. This happens because the pregnancy hormone progesterone relaxes the walls of your blood vessels, causing your blood pressure to fall (Bothamley and Boyle 2009). In the second and third trimesters, your growing uterus (womb) tends to put pressure on your blood vessels. This can also make you feel dizzy.
