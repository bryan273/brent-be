That’s because in areas where GFCI-protected outlets are required, electricians often save money by connecting additional standard outlets to one GFCI outlet. A current leak at any one of the outlets will trip the GFCI and cause all of the outlets connected to it to go dead. These GFCI-protected outlets are supposed to be labeled (Photo 1), but the label often falls off. Look for GFCIs in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, garages and on the home’s exterior. Test and reset every GFCI you find (Photo 2).
