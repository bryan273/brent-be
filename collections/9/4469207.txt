The most common cause of anterior nose bleeds is trauma such as a blow, smack, or sometimes just picking the nose. Dryness inside of the nose can also cause bleeding. In addition, high altitudes, colds, allergies, and medications are all potential culprits for triggering a nosebleed. Smoking can dry out the nose too, so quitting is especially important for recurrent nosebleeds, among many other health benefits.
