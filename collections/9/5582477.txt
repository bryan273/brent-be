Quick Answer. According to chronic pain specialist Dr. Blair Lamb, the sensation of legs or arms falling asleep is usually the result of nerve entrapment or neuropathy. While the condition is often no cause for concern, it can also indicate a stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperventilation, anxiety, vitamin deficiencies or anemia. Ultimately, many different conditions can combine to cause paresthesia, or the feeling of “pins and needles” associated with a limb falling asleep.
