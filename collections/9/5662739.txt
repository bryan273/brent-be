I have been on nitrofurantoin for UTI's before. It usually takes 2-3 days to start to feel better. When I have a UTI, I use AZO-Standard in addition to the antibiotic. You can get it OTC at the drugstore. this medication acts as a bladder anesthetic and will stop the horrible bladder spasms and allow you to pee a full bladder instead of a few drops at a time.
