Sometimes the cause of bloating and diarrhea is a long-term condition, which is often referred to as chronic. One type of chronic condition a person may develop is called irritable bowel syndrome. It is marked by abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea, and the passage of gas. Crohnâ€™s disease may cause a person to suffer not only bloating and diarrhea, but also blood in the stool, mouth sores, and intestinal ulcers.
