Bonnie February, 2014. Yes, you can give your dog Pepto Bismol for upset stomach. My little one gets an upset stomach sometimes and I give it to him. It does seem to help him.I take about 6 small pieces of bread and soak it with Pepto Bismol.He eats it and within the hour he seems to be better.ou can use this product for your dog but it’s unlikely to be needed. Further, dogs generally shouldn’t be given human formulated over-the-counter medications, especially without consulting a vet first. This goes for Pepto Bismol as well. There may also be better alternatives to Pepto Bismol.
