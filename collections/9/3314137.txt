First, it’s important to understand how breast milk is made. As the evidence-based breastfeeding site Kellymom.com explains, not everything you consume passes into your breast milk. “Breast milk is made from what passes into mom’s blood,” explains Kellymom, “Not what is in her stomach or digestive tract.”. So, as Kellymom describes, many of the things that are purported to make babies fussy — like broccoli, garlic, beans, and other gassy or spicy foods — just don’t make it into a mother’s milk.
