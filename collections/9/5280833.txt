Couples are more likely to conceive if they try 3 months after miscarriage. A new study followed 1,000 couples after an early miscarriage. 765 tried within three months - and 77% of them gave birth to a live baby. But, only 23% of the couples who waited longer to try again had a baby. The study shows couples don't have to wait after miscarriage to conceive.
