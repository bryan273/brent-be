Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common repetitive-stress motion disorder. It is caused by nerve compression and can be quite painful, although symptoms usually start gradually. At first, an affected individual may notice numbness and tingling in the hand, which is often eventually followed by continuous pain. Another cause of left hand numbness could be nerve damage or disease.
