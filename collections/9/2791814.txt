Internal hordeolum: A stye inside your eyelid. Most are caused by an infection in an oil-producing gland in your eyelid. You can also get a stye if you have blepharitis. This is a condition that makes your eyelids at the base of the eyelashes red and swollen. When you first get a stye, your eyelid is probably red and tender to the touch.
