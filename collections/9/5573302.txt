Only some martial arts as Hapkido, Aikido, Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Kyusho Jutsu, and certain styles of Kung Fu include pressure points in their teachings. There are about 300 pressure points on the human body, but very few are used in martial arts. Three types of pressure points can be distinguished: • Pain points • Muscle points • Reflex points Pain and muscles points are located all over the body while reflex points are mainly located on the center line.
