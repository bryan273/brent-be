Certain medicines can cause temporary symptoms and signs of lupus. The symptoms go away when you stop taking the medicine, typically within a few weeks. Symptoms are usually milder than in typical lupus, and the kidneys and central nervous system are rarely affected. Some children who take medicines to prevent seizures develop a condition similar to drug-induced lupus seen in adults. Symptoms go away when the child stops taking the medicine. Medicines that may play a role in inducing lupus include: 1  Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-a. 2  Certain anticonvulsants called hydantoins, such as phenytoin and ethotoin. 3  Chlorpromazine.  D-penicillamine.
