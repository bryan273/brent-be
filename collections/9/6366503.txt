The sciatic nerve, for example, passes down the back of your leg. Compression of the. nerve in the vertebrae of the lower back or the muscles of the hip or thigh can cause. pain, numbness and tingling anywhere along the path of this long nerve. In some cases, compression of leg nerves can also cause atrophy of muscles, leading to weakness and. injury. The pain and tingling caused by a compressed nerve may prompt you to quit using the. affected limb, but that is a big mistake.
