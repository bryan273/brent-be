Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the pericardium, which is the sac that surrounds your heart. Pericarditis usually doesn't cause serious problems. Most people get better in 7 to 10 days. When there are problems, they may include: 1  A buildup of fluid in the pericardial sac (pericardial effusion). 2  Sudden pressure on the heart and sudden difficulty pumping enough blood (called cardiac tamponade). 3  Constrictive pericarditis, which can occur when pericarditis comes back or becomes a longer-term problem.
