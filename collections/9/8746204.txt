A number of different infections of the feet may also cause a burning sensation. Bacterial infections of the skin, like impetigo, or deeper in the subcutaneous tissue (cellulitis) may present with burning pain among other reasons. Another infectious cause of burning feet is athleteâ€™s foot (tinea pedis). This is a superficial fungal infection of the skin on the feet and is very common. Symptoms like burning feet may also be seen with systemic infections such as HIV infection, even when there is no localized infection of the feet.
