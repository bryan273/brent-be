Fentanyl is an opioid with rapid onset of pain relief; it is often used to treat breakthrough pain. Duragesic and similar patches release fentanyl through the skin. A patch may provide pain relief for up to 72 hours. Several deaths or life-threatening overdoses have been linked to misuse of fentanyl patches.
