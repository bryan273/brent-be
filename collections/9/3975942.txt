An insect sting or bite on the feet or hands often causes swelling, itching and pain. The red lump on the skin is a typical allergic reaction to a bite by mosquitoes, spiders, bedbugs, ticks and flies, and from stings by bumblebees, ants, wasps and hornets, as reported by the University of Maryland Medical Center.
