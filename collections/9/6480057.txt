Burning symptoms fall into two main categories: paresthesias and tissue-damage burning symptoms. The two categories are easily distinguished by their very different causes. Temporary paresthesia is a prickling or pins-and-needles sensation that may be perceived as a burning symptom. It is most familiar as the sensation you feel when your leg or arm has fallen asleep because of persistent pressure on a nerve after staying in one position for too long.
