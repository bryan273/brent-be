Another essential vitamin for the construction of hair follicles is vitamin C. It is important for the construction of the collagen. According to the Oregon State University, in extreme case of vitamin C deficiency, a medical problem called scurvy (one kind of hair loss problems) may occur. Lack of B vitamins (such as B1 and B2) can lead to undernourishment of cells of hair follicles.
