Leukopenia is a shortage of white blood cells in the system, which can be caused by anemia, menorrhagia, etc. A low white blood cell count, or leukopenia will have a direct effect on your body's immune system. White blood cells are used to fight off infections within the blood stream. Without an adequate number of white blood cells your body will have trouble ridding itself of bacteria or viral matter which can cause disease.
