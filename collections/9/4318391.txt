I'm wondering if these colds are really seasonal allergies. If you tend to get colds that develop suddenly and occur at the same time every year, it's possible that you actually have seasonal allergies. Although colds and seasonal allergies may share some of the same symptoms, they are very different diseases. Common colds are caused by viruses, while seasonal allergies are immune system responses triggered by exposure to allergens. Treatment of a common cold may include rest, pain relievers and over-the-counter cold remedies, such as decongestants.
