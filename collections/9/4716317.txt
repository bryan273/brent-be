The COL1A1 gene provides instructions for making part of a large molecule called type I collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, and the white part of the eye (the sclera).ype I collagen is the most abundant form of collagen in the human body. The COL1A1 gene produces a component of type I collagen called the pro-Î±1(I) chain. Collagens begin as procollagen molecules, which must be processed by enzymes outside the cell to remove extra protein segments from their ends.
