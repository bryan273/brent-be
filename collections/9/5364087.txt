Pain Medications to Treat Kidney Stones. Over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., aspirin, Tylenol, Advil) usually are not effective by themselves for the more severe pain caused by kidney stones. However, you can try a combination of Aleve, Advil, or Motrin plus Tylenol for milder pain. Talk to your physician about what dosages of these medications is safe for you to take.
