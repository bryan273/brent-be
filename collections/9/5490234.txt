Mild allergies are an inconvenience, but severe allergies can be life-threatening. Mild allergy symptoms may not be extreme, but they can affect the entire body. Mild symptoms include skin rash, hives, runny nose, itchy eyes, nausea, or stomach cramping. Severe allergy symptoms are more extreme. Swelling caused by the allergic reaction can spread to the throat and lungs, causing allergenic asthma or a serious condition known as anaphylaxis.
