Another reason for this is that sunlight is all that is required for the synthesis of vitamin D. However, in those who do not get enough of these sources of the vitamin, rickets may develop as a sign of the deficiency. Other signs of Vitamin D deficiency include a reduction in calcium absorption and hair loss. Vitamin D deficiency causes hair loss through a disruption of the hair growth circle. The deficiency shortens the anagen phase and prolongs or speeds the onset of telogen and catagen phases.
