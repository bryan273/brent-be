Also drink plenty of water so that the process of flushing out the gallstones becomes easier. Combine the juice of cucumber, carrots and beets and drink twice daily. Olive oil and sunflower oil constitute an effective natural treatment for gallstones. Combine 30ml each of unrefined olive and sunflower oil. You can then drink about 120 ml of grapefruit juice. Do this for a few days to purge the gallstones.
