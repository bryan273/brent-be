Pain and Swelling After Liposuction. An epidural anaesthesia may be employed in surgeries that only treat the lower body. It may be as minimal as two hours for the effect of the anaesthesia to wear off. Following surgery, doctors will administer painkillers (analgesics), which the patient ingests orally.
