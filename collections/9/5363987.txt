Lycasin is a maltitol syrup with properties of taste and sweetness ideal for the preparation of sugar-free syrups, lozenges or jellies, according to manufacturer Roquette.com. Little known to most gummy bear connoisseurs, however, the side effects of Lycasin are gas, bloating and diarrhea. In some cases the sugar-free gummy bears act as a strong laxative and leave many consumers quite uncomfortable, rushing to long trips in the bathroom.
