Carpal tunnel syndrome. Overview. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes numbness, tingling and other symptoms in the hand and arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by a compressed nerve in the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway on the palm side of your wrist. The anatomy of your wrist, health problems and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.
