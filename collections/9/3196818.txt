Coconut Oil. I use coconut oil as a mild sunscreen. I’ve seen SPF ratings for coconut oil ranging from 5-10 SPF. It isn’t strong enough to use alone for all-day sun exposure but is a great every day option for mild sun protection and skin health. Many people also swear by it for helping with sunburn.
