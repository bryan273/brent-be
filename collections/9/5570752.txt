My girlfriend has recently been taken into hospital and no-one knows what's wrong with her. The hospital took bloods to test for Hepatitis and came back within a week saying that she was clear, however I have heard from other sources (without any evidence yet) that it can take up to 2 months for the blood cultures...nswers. Best Answer: if your girlfriend was tested for hepatitis, and obviously she is very sick and the tests came back negative, then she does not have hepatitis. she probably got screened for everything as soon as she got admitted.
