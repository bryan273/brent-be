Dry mouth is a common condition that could be an indication of several problems. Most notably, dry mouth could be a symptom of a blockage in your saliva glands, trauma, or burns from hot food or liquid. Drinking alcohol can cause you to become dehydrated, which leads to dry mouth and swelling in the roof of your mouth.
