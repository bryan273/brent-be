Symptoms of CSF Rhinorrhea. Rhinorrhea (runny nose) that is clear and watery may be the first sign of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. It is important to realize that these symptoms also occur in many other, more common, conditions and should be evaluated by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, throat specialist or ENT). However if you have the symptoms listed above, you should not delay an evaluation since CSF rhinorrhea can lead to serious complications.
