Ringworm has nothing to do with a worm, but is actually a fungal infection. The common symptoms of ringworm include: 1  A rash that is itchy, red, scaly, and raised, and which may blister or ooze. 2  A rash that has clearly defined edges. 3  The center of the rash is often unaffected skin, which is why the rash is called ringworm. 4  If the rash affects your scalp, patches of hair loss.
