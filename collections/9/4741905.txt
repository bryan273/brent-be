Symptoms of hypocalcemia arise from lower than normal levels of calcium in the blood. Some affected people, especially if the condition is mild, will not have symptoms. Others may have severe and life-threatening symptoms. Symptoms include numbness and/or tingling of the hands, feet, or lips, muscle cramps, muscle spasms, seizures, facial twitching, muscle weakness, lightheadedness, and slow heartbeat. Psychoemotional symptoms can also be seen, including anxiety, confusion, depression, anger, and hallucinations.
