Many people enjoy the spicy flavor of hot peppers, but eating them may trigger indigestion. Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, can cause stomach upset or an uncomfortable feeling of fullness. Your physician may recommend antacids to relieve pain, but avoiding the consumption of hot peppers also helps you keep indigestion from occurring.
