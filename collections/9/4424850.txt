How Does HIV and AIDS Cause Illness? HIV attacks and destroys a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell, commonly called the T-cell. This cell's main function is to fight disease. When a person's CD4 cell count gets low, they are more susceptible to illnesses. AIDS is the more advanced stage of HIV infection.
