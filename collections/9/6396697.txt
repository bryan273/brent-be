Having a fever actually causes you to burn more calories.. So it's very important to consume nutrient-rich foods, especially hydrating ones such as chicken soup, to rebuild your strength. Feel Better with Hot and Cold Drinks. Wash down your superfoods with a sore-throat-soothing cup of Echinacea tea. The flowering plant, used by Native Americans to treat infections for more than four centuries, may cut the duration of the common cold and flu by up to 1.4 days, according to a report published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases.
