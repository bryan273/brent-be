The liver and spleen share common blood circulation pathways. Due to the circulatory link between the liver and spleen, many disease processes affect both organs. Infections, blood cell diseases, liver diseases, cancer and inherited disorders can adversely affect the liver and spleen, causing enlargement of both organs. Any disease process that causes ongoing liver inflammation -- or chronic hepatitis -- and subsequent liver scarring can lead to cirrhosis.
