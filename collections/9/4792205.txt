Blood pregnancy tests used by doctors. Your doctor can give you a blood pregnancy test as early as 11â€“14 days after ovulation. To perform a blood pregnancy test, the doctor draws blood from a vein in your arm. This blood is sent to a laboratory for testing. The results of most blood pregnancy tests take at least a couple of days. The laboratory then advises the doctor of the result.
