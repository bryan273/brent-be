However, disability insurance is not based on a work-related injury or illness, whereas worker’s compensation is specifically for injuries or illnesses that happen on-the-job. The two types of disability insurance are short-term and long-term. 1  Short-term Disability – A shorter waiting period to get paid, but you get paid for a shorter period of time.  Long-term Disability – A longer waiting period to get paid, but you get paid for a longer amount of time.
