A Intermountain Healthcare answered. A craniotomy is a surgery to cut an opening in the skull and expose the brain. Here's what to expect: A neurosurgeon makes an incision through the skin and cuts out a small section of your skull, called a bone flap. The bone flap is removed to expose the brain underneath. The hematoma (a buildup of blood underneath the outer layer of the brain, from small veins that have been torn) is drained or removed. The bone flap is secured back in place, and the incision is closed back up with either sutures (stitches) or staples.
