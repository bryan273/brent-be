The Manitou Incline is only 1 mile but climbs 2,000 vertical feet. So how long does it take people to hike up it? Times of under 20 minutes for world class athletes pass around the local hiking community and in news articles. I have some friends that can hike the Manitou Incline in the low 20 minutes. My best time over 10 years ago was 29 1/2 minutes.
