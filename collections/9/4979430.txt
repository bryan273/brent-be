When pink eye is caused by certain bacteria or viruses, the infected person can be contagious for several days to several weeks or more. Fortunately, people do not appear to be contagious during the incubation period  the time between when they are exposed and when pink eye symptoms begin.or example, the rubeola virus causing measles and accompanying pink eye symptoms is extremely contagious, often for as long as two weeks or more.*. You also can be continually at risk of getting pink eye from exposure to certain adenoviruses found in water sources such as unchlorinated or dirty swimming pools.
