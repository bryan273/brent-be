Nothing special. All the planets align about every few thousand years, and have for the last few billion or so. About 20 years ago, there was a big panic that the planets we â€¦ re going to align, and that this was going to cause massive earthquakes.They aligned, and NOTHING happened.o be honest, the gravitational forces of the other planets is so tiny, they couldn't disturb a butterfly. Actually the planets align every 50 thousand years and when they do we don't know what happens but its not good.
