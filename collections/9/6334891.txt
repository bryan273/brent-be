What causes you to moan in your sleep? Answer Wiki. When you are in REM sleep, aka the dream part of sleep, your muscles stiffen up as if to keep you from re-enacting your dreams. Therefore, you may be yelling, or speaking in your dreams, but in reality, your muscles cant move to form the words, which results in a sort of moaning sound.
