If you don't like taking medications or supplements, there are things you can do every day of your cycle or leading up to your cycle that can help reduce cramping. Regular exercise such as walking helps to prevent or at least reduce the severity of menstrual cramps for some women. If you are in too much pain to exercise, consider a more gentle type of exercise like an aquatic-based program or yoga.
