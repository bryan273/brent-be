September 21, 2009. Dog ears are sensitive and earaches can cause problems for your pet. A sign of an earache will be the dog frequently shaking his head, rubbing the side of his head against surfaces, or scratching inside the ear with a paw. Causes of earaches are often ear infections, built-up wax, debris or ear mites.
