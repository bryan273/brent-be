Surgery can also lead to bladder spasms, especially procedures that involve the lower abdominal area. Bladder surgery, C-section, hysterectomy, and prostate removal are examples of operations that could lead to bladder spasm. As mentioned above, medications and diet can cause bladder spasms. These medications include chemotherapy drugs and diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) or hydrochlorothiazide. Spicy, acidic, or citrusy food and/or chemicals and preservatives can irritate the bladder and lead to spasms.
