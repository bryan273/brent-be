Ingrown hair is a very common skin condition occurring primarily in post pubertal individuals. An ingrown hair happens when the sharp tip of the hair curls back or grows sideways into the skin. It is a benign condition, which usually appears as a small tan or sometimes pink bump under the skin. Often, a small pinpoint (often dark) part of the underlying hair may be seen under the skin bump.
