Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, may also be a long-term condition affecting the skin. It occurs because of a hypersensitivity reaction (similar to an allergy), in which the skin reacts to triggers, such as dyes, fabrics, soaps, animals, and other irritants.czema appears on the hands very commonly. This is because soaps, lotions, and contact with certain fabric, animals, and other allergens or irritants that the hands come in contact with can cause a reaction in people with hypersensitive skin.
