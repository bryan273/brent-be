When a patient has external hemorrhoids, they will lie under the skin around the anus. They can become very itchy and may bleed. Sometimes, the blood may accumulate and form a thrombus (clot), which can be painful; the area will swell and become inflamed. External hemorrhoids are more likely to present with pain.
