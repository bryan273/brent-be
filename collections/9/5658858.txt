Hypocarbia â€“ Electrolyte effects. Definition. Hypocarbia exists when PaCO2 is below 35 mmHg, which is typically the result of hyperventilation causing a respiratory alkalosis. Several electrolytes are affected by the increase in pH. Within 5-10 minutes there is drop in plasma [HCO3-] from titration of nonbicarbonate body buffers.
