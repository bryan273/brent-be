Nasal polyposis is an inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. Nasal polyps are the most common tumors of the nasal cavity. Approximately 30% of patients with nasal polyps test positive for environmental allergies. The prevalence of nasal polyps is increased in children with cystic fibrosis and persons with known aspirin hypersensitivity. Nasal polyposis can impair a person's quality of life more than perennial allergic rhinitis.
