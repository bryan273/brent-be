Back to Index. Pityriasis lichenoides is an uncommon disease of the skin that can present in three different forms: pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA), pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC), and febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease (FUMHD).These three forms represent a spectrum of disease presentation.hare |. PLEVA starts as an acute eruption of bright red, flat to slightly raised, 2-10 mm oval spots. The lesions then evolve, developing small blisters and pustules, and eventually ulcerate and crust over. The lesions can appear singly or in groups, and can coalesce into large areas of rash.
