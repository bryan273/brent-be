A. I have taken 600 mg. of this medication, 3x's per day, for over 15 years for back pain. Neurontin is an anti seizure medication. As with some other prescriptions, a doctor may prescribe a medication for disorders other than their original intended use. This practice is referred to as OFF-LABEL. I am very familiar with this medication and its uses but. heard of Neurontin being used to treat anxiety or depression. Although I am not an expert, there is nothing to stop a doctor from prescribing Neurontin for depression or anxiety.
