In the United Sates, sickle cell anemia affects tens of thousands of blacks, and variations of it are seen in whites of Mediterranean, Middle-Eastern and East Indian descent. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein of red blood cells. In sickle cell anemia, abnormal blood cells turn rigid, assume a sickle shape and block vessels. The painful episodes associated with the disease are fewer among patients who have a naturally higher level of fetal hemoglobin, which normally diminishes as people age.
