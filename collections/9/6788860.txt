However, water vapor can also be one of the most abundant gases! The maximum amount of water vapor air can hold is 4%, so water vapor could be number 3 or 4 on this list. On average, the amount of water vapor is 0.25% of the atmosphere, by mass (4th most abundant gas). Warm air holds more water than cool air.
