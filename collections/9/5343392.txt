This creates a force on the surface that tries to minimise its area. When considered as a force rather than an energy, the force is called surface tension. As temperature increases, the atoms in a solid vibrate more, and reduce the cohesive force binding the atoms. The surface energy depends on the net inward cohesive force and so surface energy decreases with increasing temperature. The surface energy for many metals (e.g. Ag, Au, and Cu) goes down by about 0.5 mJ.m2.K-1 with increasing temperature. Water goes down by about 160 mJ.m2.K-1.
