Kidney Infection Diagnosis. The most important test in diagnosing kidney infection is a urinalysis (UA). This is basically a test to analyze urine sample and evaluate for an infection in the urine. Urinalysis is done by collecting a clean catch, midstream urine in a sterile collection cup. The urine may be analyzed by the doctor in the office using or by analysis in a laboratory. Because urine is normally sterile, any finding suggesting an infection may be considered abnormal and supportive of a kidney infection. 1  Gross inspection of urine (macroscopic analysis) may reveal cloudy urine.
