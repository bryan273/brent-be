Clubfoot is a birth abnormality that causes a newborn baby's feet to point down and inward. While clubfoot does not cause pain, it can cause long-term problems if left untreated, affecting the child's ability to walk normally. However, if clubfoot is properly treated, the deformity can often be cured in early childhood.
