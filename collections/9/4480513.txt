Sometimes a shake or shudder will emanate from the engine compartment, because the engine isn't getting enough air, fuel or spark that it needs to run smoothly. Symptoms that might indicate such an engine-related case of the shakes include the following: 1  Shudder or jerking occurs during acceleration. 2  Staccato shaking, as if over a highway rumble strip, within a specific speed range. 3  Car starts and drives fine for a while, but later begins to shake.
