In Indiana, you can obtain a death certificate if you can show that you have a direct interest in the death record and that the certificate is necessary to determine your personal or property rights, or for compliance with state or federal law.Indiana Code § 16-37-3-3.) The law doesn’t say how quickly the certificate must be filed, but Indiana has an electronic death registry system to help registrations move quickly through the system. You may need to obtain copies of a death certificate for a number of reasons.
