Block example. tags and tags are naturally displayed block-style. (I say “naturally” because you can override the display style by setting the CSS display property e.g. display:inline; .). A block-display element will span the full width of the space available to it, and so will start on a new line in the flow of HTML. The flow will continue on a new line after the block-display element. Here I’ve started a paragraph and now I’m going to insert a. new div inside my paragraph.
