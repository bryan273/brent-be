First release date: April 1983. The debut studio album from the Violent Femmes. It is considered the the band's biggest-selling album and their only release that went platinum by the RIAA, selling over a million copies. The album also features many of their well-known songs, including Blister in the Sun, Kiss Off, Add It Up and Gone Daddy Gone. Although this album actually came out in April 1983, the official release date has apprently been called into confusion. Due to a typo on the Violent Femmes' website and some copies of the album, many believe that it was released in 1982, but this is almost certainly not true. Wikipedia also claims that it was released on November 30, 1982 but there are no facts to support this.
