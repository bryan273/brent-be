Muscle adhesions. 1  repetitive strain and long term muscle tension induces adhesions. 2  a healthy muscle, the small fibers (fibrils) glides over one another during contraction. 3  The repetitive strain and muscle tension, shortens fibers that transform to adhesions which limits the gliding (contraction)
