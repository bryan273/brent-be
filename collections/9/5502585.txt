Many women feel as though they are in a perpetually bloated state, but there is no rounding of the belly to show for it! How soon you begin to “show” is as varied and individual as women are. During the third or fourth month of pregnancy seems to be the time most women begin to show their pregnancies. Although you may not quite be ready for maternity clothes, you will be ready to move into drawstring or elastic-band pants. Some women don’t really begin to show until well into their fifth month.
