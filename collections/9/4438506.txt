Alprazolam is used for all types of anxiety, but it's one of the few medicines prescribed for panic disorder. Most other benzodiazepines (including Alprazolam) are used primarily for generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. Alprazolam binds to GABA receptors to produce these anxiolytic qualities.
