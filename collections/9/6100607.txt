The blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue. The two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral (within the brain) hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures. Two types of weakened blood vessels usually cause hemorrhagic stroke: aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). View a detailed animation of hemorrhagic stroke. 1  An aneurysm is a ballooning of a weakened region of a blood vessel. 2  An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a cluster of abnormally formed blood vessels.
