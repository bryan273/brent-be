The SOD1 mouse develops an ALS-like disease that researchers hope overlaps enough with human ALS that mouse responses to treatment might predict human responses. SOD1 gene mutations, however, cause a familial (inherited) form of human ALS that’s present in only 1 percent to 3 percent of ALS cases. For some 90 percent of patients, the disease isn’t familial. Its onset is unpredictable (sporadic) and the cause is unknown.
