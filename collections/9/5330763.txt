The romantic weeping willow tree is simply perfection planted by a pond where its beauty is reflected in the water. Of all weeping trees, this one is a classic...dreamy and beautiful, it's a favorite to sit under and read a book, watch as the long branches sway in the breeze, play hide and seek, you name it.In South Florida, willow trees are happiest in cooler areas. They are deciduous (bare in winter) and need lots of room.This tree has a medicinal background. Indians used to relieve headaches by chewing on young twigs...which contain salicylic acid, the main ingredient in aspirin.ust avoid planting a weeping willow anywhere near water or sewer lines (or septic tank drain fields). The tree's roots will go a great distance for water and can damage these systems.
