Visceral Pain. Visceral pain is the pain we feel when our internal organs are damaged or injured and is by far the most common form of pain. Viscera refers to the internal areas of the body that are enclosed in a cavity. Visceral pain is caused by the activation of pain receptors in the chest, abdomen or pelvic areas.t is much more subjective and not easily described as acute pain. The three pain types can be felt at the same time or singly and at different times. The different types of pain respond differently to the various pain medications. Somatic and visceral pain are easier to treat than neuropathic pain.
