Depending upon the underlying cause of palpitations, medications may be prescribed to control the heart rate and rhythm. Other treatments may involve ablation or surgical techniques to remove the underlying cause of certain palpitations. Pacemakers and defibrillators may be indicated if life-threatening conditions are the cause of palpitations.
