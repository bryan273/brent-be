Anaplastic carcinoma (also called giant and spindle cell cancer) is the most dangerous form of thyroid cancer. It is rare, and spreads quickly. Follicular carcinoma is more likely to come back and spread. Medullary carcinoma is a cancer of non-thyroid cells that are normally present in the thyroid gland.
