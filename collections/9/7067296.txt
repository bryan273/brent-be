Question: How is Bacterial Vaginosis Treated? Answer: Bacterial vaginosis treatment is usually with one of several antibiotics / antifungals. Multiple treatments may be necessary. Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated topically. In other words, creams or gels are applied to the vagina. However, BV can also be treated using oral medications.
