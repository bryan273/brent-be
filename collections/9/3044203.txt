Eye pain sometimes is caused by dry eyes, which needs to be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medication. Occasionally, eye pain is caused by something serious, like uveitis. This is an inflammation of the inner eye tissues, like the iris. Again, this type of condition should be treated as soon as possible.
