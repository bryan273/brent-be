The minimum is usually 3-4 years, and it is usually 6 years for those who opt to do a combined M.D. + specialty training in OMFS. In the US, Maxillofacial surgeons have to do 4 years of dental school, then 4 or 6 years for OMFS, depending on the program (2 extra years in general surgery and med school).
