Each turbine produces about 2,000,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) per year, enough energy to power as many as 500 typical homes at 12,000 kwh per year. How strong do the winds have to blow for the blades to rotate? Wind turbines start operating at wind speeds of around 8 mph and reach a maximum power output at around 33 mph. When there is not enough wind to turn the blades, or when there is too much wind the turbines shut down. How much do wind turbines cost? It costs over $2.5 million to set up a 1650 KW turbine.
