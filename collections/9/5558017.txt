Small, red reactions less than 1-2‚Äù in size (the size of a dime) are common do not represent Lyme disease. These are tick-bite reactions, often confused with the rash of Lyme disease. With a tick-bite reaction, the red area does not expand over 24 to 48 hours. Small reactions at the bite site can last days to weeks. The earliest stage of Lyme disease occurs at the site of the tick bite. If the rash is Lyme, it will get bigger over days or weeks and will not fade over the next few days.
