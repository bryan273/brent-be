Other than stress, the causes of chronic hives are quite different when compared to the causes of acute hives. Allergies only cause about 5 to 10% of chronic hives cases. When allergies cause chronic hives, pet allergy is usually to blame. Pollen, mold or dust mite allergies only rarely cause chronic hives. Chronic infections, such as viral hepatitis, sinus infections, and urinary tract infections, can cause chronic hives. Some studies have shown that infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria commonly connected with stomach ulcers, is also associated with chronic hives.
