Hello, Cats can bleed for up to about 7 days after giving birth. If the bleeding is heavy and/or if there is any other discharge which is colored, like green or cream colored, this is serious, as it can indicate a uterine infection called pyometra, and your cat needs to see the vet, ASAP, for evaluation and treatment. http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/pyometra.html. If the bleeding has not stopped or slowed down after a few more days, (as long as it's not very heavy bleeding now) definitely put a call in to your vet and have her seen.
