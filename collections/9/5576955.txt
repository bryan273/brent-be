Meaning of the Term Afterload. Although the concept of afterload is used on a daily basis by clinicians (eg, “afterload reduction during treatment of heart failure”), it is unclear what the term really means and how to accurately measure it.he aforementioned afterload concepts and principles apply to both the systemic and the pulmonary circulation. Because the right and left heart are constructed in series, they necessarily transport the same amount of blood and thus have the same cardiac output in the absence of a shunt.
