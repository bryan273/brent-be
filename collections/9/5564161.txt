As a patient with COPD, your health care provider may determine your oxygen levels at rest, while sleeping, or during exercise to see if oxygen may help you. If your oxygen levels are low, oxygen therapy will help reduce the strain on your heart, brain, and muscles, and using oxygen as directed may help you feel better.
