Vitamin B12: Why You Need It and Where to Get It. Like other B vitamins, vitamin B12 is a nutrient that supports the formation of red blood cells and the maintenance of the central nervous system. You can find vitamin B12 in a variety of animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy. Plant foods like almond milk and cereal may contain vitamin B12 if they are fortified. Still, vitamin B12 deficiency affects between 1.5% and 15% of Americans, and some are at a higher risk than others. Because strict vegetarians and vegans eliminate animal products from their diet, this group is at a higher risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause anemia and circulatory problems.
