Heightened Senses During Pregnancy. Like many things during a pregnancy, the changes in a woman's senses are largely attributed to hormones. When women become pregnant, their levels of estrogen increase. Estrogen has been linked with an increased sense of smell in non-pregnant women as well.ut scientists aren't exactly sure how (or if) estrogen creates the change in the nose or in the brain [sources: Harvard Women's Watch, Pletsch and Kratz ]. Scientists also debate whether a pregnant woman's heightened senses serve any benefit to her or her unborn baby.
