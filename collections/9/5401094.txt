A RealAge answered. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are used successfully by some individuals for preventive treatment of migraine attacks. These medications are proved to reduce headache severity, frequency, and duration; they are often prescribed for chronic tension-type headaches. Be aware that possible side effects include increased appetite and weight gain. People who have abnormal heart rhythms should not use tricyclic antidepressants.
