For the normal pain that is associated with tooth extraction, you can simply take over-the-counter painkillers such as Ibuprofen. This should help in any slight or normal pain after tooth extraction. Keep monitoring any pain or discomfort and if you are ever worried about it, contact your dentist immediately.
