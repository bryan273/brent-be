What is White-Nose Syndrome? White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that affects bats that hibernate in the winter and is associated with a newly discovered fungus, Geomyces destructans. The disease was named white-nose syndrome because when first discovered, infected bats had white fungus on their muzzles. WNS was first documented in New York in 2006 and has since spread through out the Northeast and Canada.
