Answer by finette (157) Pink eye can be caused by fecal bacteria getting into the eye, but there are a lot of other possible causes as well. The most common cause of pink eye (also called conjunctivitis) is a viral infection, which can be spread from person to person just like a cold. Pink eye can also be caused by an allergic reaction.
