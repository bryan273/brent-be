Divergent plate boundaries. One young divergent plate boundary that you'll recognize is actively forming the Red Sea. Although the Arabian penninsula and Africa were once linked to form a single continent, they are now being ripped apart. The white arrows show the directions the two plates are moving.You can see that a new ocean, the Red Sea is being formed as they separate.he weaknesses between the diverging plates fill with molten rock from below. Sea water cools the molten rock, which quickly solidifies, forming new oceanic lithosphere. This continuous process builds a chain of volcanoes and rift valleys called a mid-ocean ridge or spreading ridge.
