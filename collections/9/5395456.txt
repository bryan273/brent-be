As the conjunctiva only covers the white of your eye, the central area of the eye (the cornea) is not affected. Your cornea is responsible for your sight, so any bleeding under the conjunctiva should not affect your vision. In addition to covering the sclera, the conjunctiva also lines the insides of your eyelids. It contains many tiny glands that secrete fluid to protect and lubricate your eye. Blood under the conjunctiva is not a dangerous condition.
