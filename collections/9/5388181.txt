You may also be deficient in several vits and minerals, such as potassium, vit D, and all the B's, including the magnesium that kaismama mentioned. A deficiency in any or all of those (and others) can cause your legs, feet and toes to cramp (and curl) as you've described. Ask your doc for a blood test to determine if you are deficient in any vits and minerals, very important.
