My gerbil is sneezing. Gerbils are able to catch the common cold from humans and suffer from similar symptoms including a runny nose and sneezing. In more severe cases they may have laboured breathing, runny eyes and refuse to eat or drink and as a consequence suffer from weight loss.o help avoid your pet from catching a cold, don’t handle him if you’ve got a cold yourself. If you think your gerbil has started to get a cold treat them early as if the cold is severe then it can lead to bronchitis or pneumonia. For further information please contact your vet.
