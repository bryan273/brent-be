Periods of anxiety trigger the release of hormones that cause increased heart rate and decreased blood vessel diameter, both of which lead to increased blood pressure. 1  The effect of stress on short term blood pressure can be dramatic, leading to mean arterial pressure increases of 30%-40%. These changes are short lived, though, with heart rate, blood vessel diameter, and blood pressure returning to normal as the hormones are eliminated.
