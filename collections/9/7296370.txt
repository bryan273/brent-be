In strut suspension systems, the spring is held by the strut, and the strut provides structural support for the vehicle. Struts are more common on cars than on trucks and larger vehicles. Shocks, on the other hand, provide no structural support for your vehicle. They are mounted directly to the vehicleâ€™s frame at one end and the lower suspension on the other end. Shocks are most commonly found on trucks, SUVs and vans.
