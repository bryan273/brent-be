Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited (genetic) immune system disorder that occurs when a type of white blood cell (phagocyte) that usually helps your body fight infections doesn't work properly. As a result, the phagocytes can't protect your body from bacterial and fungal infections. People with chronic granulomatous disease often may develop pneumonia, lung infections, skin infections, lymph node infections, liver infections, gastrointestinal inflammation or other infections. They may develop clusters of white blood cells (masses) in infected areas (granulomas).
