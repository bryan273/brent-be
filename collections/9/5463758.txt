A wart is a small growth with a rough texture that can appear anywhere on the body. It can look like a solid blister or a small cauliflower. Warts are caused by viruses in the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. The appearance of a wart depends on its location on the body and the thickness of the skin. Palmar warts appear on the hand. Plantar warts affect the feet. As many as 1 in 3 children and teenagers are estimated to have warts, but only 3 to 5 percent of adults.
