Tattoos are permanent, especially flesh colour tattoos. We do not recommend tattooing areas of vitiligo, as the colour match has to be EXACT or the patches will be very obvious. If you are considering a tattoo (not recommended), go light first, then gradually darken. Colour matching your skin to patches of vitiligo can be very difficult. Back to Index.
