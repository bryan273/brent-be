To help you cope with your signs and symptoms until the diarrhea goes away, try to: 1  Drink plenty of clear liquids, including water, broths and juices. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. 2  Add semisolid and low-fiber foods gradually as your bowel movements return to normal. Try soda crackers, toast, eggs, rice or chicken.
