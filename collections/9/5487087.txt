Symptoms of Colon Polyps. In most cases, polyps do not cause any symptoms. Because they typically don't cause symptoms, polyps can go undetected until they are found during a colonoscopy or other test on the colon. When polyps do cause symptoms, they can include: Blood in the stool (black or red). Bleeding from the rectum.
