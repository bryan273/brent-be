Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs Tip #2: Donâ€™t boil the water vigorously! That will likely crack the shells from bouncing the eggs around too much. 5. Set a timer for 15 minutes for small eggs, 17 minutes for large, and 19 minutes for super-jumbo. 6. A few minutes before the timer is done, fill a large bowl with ice cubes and add a few inches of cool water. 7. As soon as the timer goes off, use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to the ice bath.
