Causes of Diabetic Shock. A diabetic shock occurs in dogs that are diagnosed with diabetes, and indicates a condition determined by a low level of glucose in the blood or hypoglycemia. The condition may be caused by: 1  An overdose of insulin, if you administer too much or the prescribed dose is too high. Excessive exercise that will cause a decrease of the glucose levels in the blood. 2  If the dog skips a meal, this will result in an immediate drop in the blood sugar; even a one-hour delay of the meal may result in low levels of glycemia.
