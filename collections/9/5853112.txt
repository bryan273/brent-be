Wide angle prime. Zeiss 24 f/1.8 ($999): This is the best wide angle prime lens for the Sony E-mount. It has a field of view equivalent to a 35mm lens. It has the widest maximum aperture, it is the sharpest wide angle prime for E-mount, and it has awesome bokeh. Unfortunately, it is also quite expensive.
