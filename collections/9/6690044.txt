The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is unknown. It is believed to be due to a number of factors, including alteration in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility, abnormal nervous system signals, increased sensitivity to pain, and food intolerances. The following are risk factors thought to cause IBS: 1  Abnormal movements of the colon and small intestines (too fast or slow, or too strong) 2  Hypersensitivity to pain from a full bowel or gas. 3  Food sensitivities, possibly caused by poor absorption of sugars or acids in food.
