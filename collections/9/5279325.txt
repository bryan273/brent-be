If you wake up with a headache, it may be a cold, especially if you have other symptoms such as sneezing, stuffy nose, and body aches. You may need to stay home a day or two while you're most contagious and feel the worst. If you have a headache and can't handle noise or light, you may have a migraine and shouldn't be at work.
