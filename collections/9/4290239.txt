Thrush is an infection of the oral mucous membranes (inner lining of the mouth and tongue) by the fungus Candida albicans. Thrush is also termed oral thrush, oral candidiasis, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Thrush infection is not very common in the healthy population. However, thrush can be present in about 5%-7% of babies less than 1 month old, in AIDS patients (about 9%-31%), and in approximately 20% of cancer patients. Oral thrush, a fungal infection, is not considered contagious. The causative fungus, Candida albicans, is often already a natural inhabitant of the mouth and throat. When the oral environment changes (usually due to an immature or depressed immune system), the fungus can multiply and cause symptoms.
