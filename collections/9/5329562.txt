Even days after drinking too much coffee can cause such shakes. Coffee is also a stimulant which can be bad for the body in excess. Shakes after a night of drinking include involuntary shaking of the limbs, inability to hold objects like pens, glasses and other small objects. Sometimes shakes after drinking can also include involuntary dribbling.
