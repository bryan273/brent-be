Neck pain and stiff neck. Introduction. Neck pain or a stiff neck is a common problem and generally nothing to worry about. The pain and stiffness usually gets better after a few days or weeks, and is rarely a sign of a more serious problem. You can get a painful or stiff neck if you sleep in an awkward position, use a computer for a prolonged period of time, or strain a muscle because of bad posture. Anxiety and stress can also sometimes cause tension in your neck muscles, which can lead to pain in your neck.
