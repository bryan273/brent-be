The Cause of Ovarian Cyst. Xenoestrogens are Suspected of Causing Ovarian Cysts. Ovarian Cysts are products of failed or disordered ovulation. A functional ovarian cyst is formed when the follicle does NOT release its egg, and the follicle continues to grow forming a cyst. An ovarian cyst can also be formed even if the follicle releases the egg, the hole where the egg is released closes up, the corpus luteum is NOT formed, and the cyst continues to grow.
