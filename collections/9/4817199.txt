 'Tiger! Tiger! Burning bright, / in the forests of the night.'. Blake wrote that. Apparently the tiger was on fire. Maybe his tail got struck by lightning or something.y take is that the fearful symmetry rhymes with Did he who made the lamb make thee, from the second-to-last stanza, bringing a bit more emphasis to that line. Haj Ross wrote a 45-page paper about the poem [1] where he goes on for a while about the impact of the lamb line.
