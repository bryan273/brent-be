Circulatory hypoxia: In this form of hypoxia the lungs are working just fine and the blood can carry sufficient oxygen. However, the tissue is not receiving sufficient oxygen because the heart cannot pump the blood to the tissue (or the arteries leading to the tissue have been blocked by clots etc...).
