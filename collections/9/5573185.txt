Well i think that it being an SSRI drug, it can help with anxiety, actually alot of meds not marketed for certain things can work for other problems. I was taking prozac for my ocd, at a high dose, it worked wonders but didnt help my depression, go figure. But on the other hand prozac can make you jittery and antsy.
