I always got sinus infections in the fall and spring, the suddenly one year I got a severe vertigo attack. The attacks became more frequent and I lost my hearing in my right ear. It appears that I have several triggers. Barometric pressure, over excretion, salty foods, and stress all bring about a vertigo attack.
