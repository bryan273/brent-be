Understanding the cause of whiteheads can help you know what to do to prevent future breakouts. Clogged pores are the main cause of whiteheads. Your pores can become blocked for several reasons. One cause of blocked pores is hormonal changes, which are common triggers of acne. Certain life stages can increase the amount of sebum, or oil, your pores produce. The increased oil production causes clogged pores and whiteheads. Taking birth control pills can also increase hormone levels and cause acne in women.
