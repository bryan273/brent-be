Foods themselves don't contain serotonin but what you eat may be able to tip the balance in favour of increased serotonin production in the brain.Most notably, a carbohydrate rich diet-plenty of pasta, wholemeal bread, high fibre cereals etc-is thought to help.oods themselves don't contain serotonin but what you eat may be able to tip the balance in favour of increased serotonin production in the brain.
