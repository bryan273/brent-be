Optic Nerve. The Optic Nerve, also called Cranial Nerve II, is the nerve that transmits visual information from the Retina to the Brain. Optic Disc. The Optic Disc or Optic Nerve head is the point in the eye where the optic nerve fibers leave the retina. Due to absence of light sensitive rods and cones of the retina at this point, it is not sensitive to light and thus is also known as The Blind Spot or Anatomical Blind Spot.
