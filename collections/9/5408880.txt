Fluid Overload in a Dialysis Patient. Having too much water in your body is called fluid overload or hypervolemia. One of the main functions of the kidneys is to balance fluid in the body. If too much fluid builds up in your body, it can have harmful effects on your health, such as difficulty breathing and swelling. When you are on dialysis, your kidneys are no longer able to keep the right balance of fluid in your body.
