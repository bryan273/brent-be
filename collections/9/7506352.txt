The pencil pregnancy test is used to determine the gender of unborn babies. By placing a needle on the end of a pencil eraser and then adding the string to the needle, you can create a do-it-yourself ultrasound â€“ make sure to still get the ultrasound, but once you do, you will realize the pencil test was correct!
