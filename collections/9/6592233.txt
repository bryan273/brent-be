Neck problems and injuries most commonly occur during sports or recreational activities, work-related tasks, or projects around the home. Neck pain may feel like a kink, stiffness, or severe pain. Pain may spread to the shoulders, upper back, or arms, or it may cause a headache. Neck movement may be limited, usually more to one side than the other. Neck pain refers to pain anywhere from the area at the base of the skull into the shoulders.
