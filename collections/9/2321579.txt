Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and the Environment. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are a group of cancers that start in lymphoid tissue, also called lymph or lymphatic tissue. The causes of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are mostly unknown. Specific viruses, immune deficiency, and specific autoimmune conditions have been implicated in increased risk. However, some environmental issues, including exposures to pesticides and solvents, are also being investigated.
