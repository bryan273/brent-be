Smoking causes depression because of the withdrawal from a physically and psychologically addictive substance, called nicotine. Nicotine which acts as a receptor for the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, indirectly stimulates the release of another neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the brainâ€™s reward or motivation center.
