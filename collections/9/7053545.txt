The main risk factors for ovarian cancer include: 1  Having a family history of ovarian cancer. Having a mother, sister, or daughter who has had ovarian cancer will raise your risk. 2  Inheriting gene changes. A small number of women with a family history of cancer have inherited gene changes, such as the BRCA gene changes.
