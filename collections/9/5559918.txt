When circulation is complete, the coolant or antifreeze mixture is then drained and replaced with the standard mix of coolant and water. There is no set rule for how often a vehicle needs a radiator flush. Car manufacturers recommend that it be done at least every other year or every 40,000 to 60,000 miles. Occasionally flushing the radiator before that period is not a problem as it helps to clean and prevent build up of dirt and sediment.
