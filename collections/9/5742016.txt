Some people with colitis may have difficulty digesting foods with lactose, according to the Mayo Clinic. Lactose is a sugar found in dairy foods. To limit colitis symptoms, like diarrhea, people with colitis should avoid foods containing lactose, or use an enzyme to help digest the lactose called called lactase. Dairy foods with lactose include milk, some cheeses, ice cream, half and half, yogurt, condensed milk, nonfat dried milk powder and cream cheese.
