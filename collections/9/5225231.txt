For other uses, see Cornea (disambiguation) . The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. The cornea, with the anterior chamber and lens, refracts light, with the cornea accounting for approximately two-thirds of the eye's total optical power.In humans, the refractive power of the cornea is approximately 43 dioptres. While the cornea contributes most of the eye's focusing power, its focus is fixed.The curvature of the lens, on the other hand, can be adjusted to tune the focus depending upon the object's distance.n humans, the refractive power of the cornea is approximately 43 dioptres.
