Blood test: There are two kinds of blood tests: qualitative hCG and quantitative hCG, also called a beta hCG test. You can take these within seven to 12 days of conception, which means you can test sooner than a urine test [source: American Pregnancy Association]. However, results take longer to get. With a blood test, your doctor will take a blood sample.
