when i started to show I def noticed my shape changing around 8-10 weeks, it was water retention but i quite liked looking pregnant so early even though it wasnt the baby!! now at 14 weeks i have a larger bump than you would expect, everyone is different, my mum was the same, in maternity clothes from 10 weeks!
