Hi Rhoda, My migraines are linked with spikes in my blood pressure. We found the same thing - that my blood pressure would go up when my migraine started. I now take a beta blocker called nadolol and it doesn't let my blood pressure spike and my migraines are less severe than they were originally. This hasn't stopped the migraines as it does for some, but it makes it a lot better.
