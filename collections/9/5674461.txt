Delay caused by a short stress time is usually a week or two, then you ovulate normally. However, under continued stress (heavy exercise, malnutrition, etc.) you can be anovulatory for a very long time. If you are having problems in this area, have a look at this book: Fertility, Cycles & Nutrition 4th Edition.
