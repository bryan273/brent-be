Morning Sickness signified by feeling queasy, nauseous and actual vomiting is one of the least joyous aspects of being pregnant. In a survey of pregnant women the average start of morning sickness was 5.5 weeks after the last period. However 4-6 weeks is perfectly normal and for some ladies it might not happen until the hormones are significantly higher between weeks 8-12.
