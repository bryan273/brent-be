Diagnosis and Treatment. There are basically three different causes of anemia: blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, or destruction of red blood cells. Blood tests will not only confirm the diagnosis of anemia, but also help point to the underlying condition. Tests might include: 1  Complete blood count (CBC), which determines the number, size, volume, and hemoglobin content of red blood cells. 2  Blood iron level and your serum ferritin level, the best indicators of your body's total iron stores.
