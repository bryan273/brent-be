What is the difference between Compex (EMS) and a TENS unit? TENS the acronym for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation. A TENS unit is prescribed for both acute pain and chronic pain conditions and sends electrical impulses to certain parts of the body to block pain signals from being transmitted to the brain. It is used at the sensory level and does not cause muscle contraction.
