The Td vaccine protects against two bacterial illnesses: tetanus and diphtheria. It is recommended for 7–10 year olds who haven’t completed the DTaP primary series. All adults should get a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Patients must be 19 years or older in Connecticut, and 11 years or older in Kentucky.
