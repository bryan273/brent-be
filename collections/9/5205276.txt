The extent of the swelling depends upon the site of the bee sting. Some body parts tend to swell more than the others. For instance, you will notice a considerable swelling, if the bee stung you on face, as opposed to hands or legs. You can reduce the swelling from bee sting by immediately applying a pack of ice.
