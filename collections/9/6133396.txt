Symptoms of Stroke: Introduction. Symptoms of a stroke differ depending on a variety of factors, including the cause and the type and size of the area of the brain that is affected. In some cases, symptoms may be mild and only include weakness, dizziness or headache. Symptoms such as these may also be warning symptoms of an impending stroke. This is called a transient ischemic attack. Strokes often do occur suddenly with dramatic symptoms, such as numbness and weakness or paralysis of the face, a leg or arm, or entire side of the body.
