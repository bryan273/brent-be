Morning sickness usually starts around week six of your pregnancy. But because every pregnancy is different, this can vary from woman to woman. If you have morning sickness, you may feel queasy when you wake up. But although it is called morning sickness, nausea can strike at any time of the day or night. You're just more likely to feel sick in the morning because your stomach is empty. Certain smells may set off your nausea at any time.
