In aviation, pressure altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter is set to an agreed baseline pressure setting under certain circumstances where the aircraft's altimeter would be unable to give a useful readout of altitude.ircraft transponders report the pressure altitude; corrections for atmospheric pressure variations are applied on the ground. The relationship between static pressure and pressure altitude is defined in terms of the properties of the International Standard Atmosphere.
