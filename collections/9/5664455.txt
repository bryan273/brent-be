It'll just take a while. If you have a microwave, it's faster to defrost in the microwave and then boil. From the frozen state, it should take about 15 minutes or so to boil a chicken breast till done. take it out and split it open a little in the middle. If it's still red or pink, put it back in for a few more minutes. For me, flavor's better when you turn down the flame once the chicken is in the boiling water.
