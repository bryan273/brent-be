Headaches are triggered by the hormonal changes that are happening in your body. They're very common in early pregnancy. The hormone progesterone helps to relax your womb (uterus) and blood vessels in your body, including those in your head and neck. Blood then pounds through these veins, causing headaches. Changes in your blood pressure may trigger tension-type headaches.
