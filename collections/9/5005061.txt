This fluid buildup can have a number of different causes, most notably insufficiency of the venus system, water retention secondary to heart, kidney, liver, or endocrine disease, as well as local musculoskeletal issues such as trauma, infections, or tumors. All of these can cause swollen ankles. Pregnant women deal with swollen ankles on a daily basis due to weight gain and water retention. Waiters and waitresses also deal with swollen ankles after standing and walking for long periods.
