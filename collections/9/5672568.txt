When people refer to Social Security, they general mean retirement benefits. SSDI is Social Security Disability Insurance, which is paid from the same fund, but available only to disabled people who are below full retirement age. If you're asking whether you can receive both Social Security retirement and Social Security disability benefits, the answer is no.
