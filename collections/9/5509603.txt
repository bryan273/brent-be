Seizures are brain malfunctions that alter a personâ€™s awareness. During a seizure, the brain cells fire large bursts of energy, a departure from the normal on-and-off firing pattern. The seizure may last only a few seconds or minutes and trigger involuntary body movements, strange sensations or blackouts.
