Update: you no longer need to hack cold-brew coffee. Try a cold-brew coffee maker! Mix 1 1/3 cup coffee grounds with 8 cups cold water. Be sure to choose good coffee- crappy coffee grounds make even crappier iced coffee. {This is my favorite decaf coffee.} Stir and place in the fridge overnight. In the AM, straining the liquid out of the coffee grounds. I find it easiest to throw a coffee filter on top of a strainer and let it do itâ€™s thing.
