We're sorry, an error occurred. Vomiting blood, or hematemesis, is the regurgitation of stomach contents mixed with blood, or the regurgitation of blood only. Vomiting blood can be a frightening experience, but in some cases it may be triggered by minor causes. This includes swallowing blood from a mouth injury or from a nosebleed.
