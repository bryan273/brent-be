The collection of all the genes and the various alternate or allelic forms of those genes within a population is called its gene pool. Genetic variation within a population is measured according to the number of different alleles of all genes and the frequency with which they appear. Variation is high when there are many different allelic forms of all genes and when there are many different combinations of those alleles.
