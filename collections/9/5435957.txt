If it's your first time you may not fully feel the effects of the high. For some reason unbeknownst to me, many people don't get high the first time or two. How long a high lasts depends on a number of things. i.e. quality of marijuana, amount smoked, and tolerance. Red eyes result from your eyes being dry. It usually lasts as long as the high which can be anywhere from 45 mins to 3 hours.
