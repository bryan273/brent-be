Excessive or unwanted hair that grows on a woman’s body and face is the result of a condition called hirsutism. All women have facial and body hair, but the hair is usually very fine and light in color. The main difference between typical hair on a woman’s body and face (often called “peach fuzz”) and hair caused by hirsutism is the texture. Excessive or unwanted hair that grows on a woman’s face, arms, back, or chest is usually coarse and dark. The growth pattern of hirsutism in women is associated with virilization.
