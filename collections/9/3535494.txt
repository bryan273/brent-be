Many things can cause your blood pressure to be too low, ranging from normal pregnancy-induced changes to dangerous underlying conditions, like heart problems or hormone disturbances. In some instances, what causes low blood pressure could be a simple case of dehydration brought on by vomiting, intense exercise, or the overuse of diuretics. Some studies have shown that a dehydration-induced weight loss of 1 percent is enough to trigger dizziness, confusion, or other symptoms of low blood pressure.
