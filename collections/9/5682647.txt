Restrictive lung disease. Restrictive lung disease (chest wall diseases) can result from different problems, including interstitial fibrosis, scoliosis (spine curvature), and sarcoidosis. Some cause scarring in the lungs, while others compress the lungs. Some have no known cause; other causes include occupational exposure, chemotherapeutic agents or radiation, and connective tissue diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
