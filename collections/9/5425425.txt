Stress is one of the main causes of headaches. And once you have a tension headache, you may be sensitive to light or sound. To counteract this, sit or lie down in a dimly lit room. Close your eyes and try to relax your back, neck, and shoulders. Turn off sources of noise like a television, computer, or cellphone.
