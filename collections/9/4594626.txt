(A) Calculate the specific heat capacity at constant volume of water vapor, assuming the nonlinear tri-atomic molecules has three translational and three rotational degree of freedom and that vibrational motion does not contribute. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol.(B) The actual specific heat capacity of water vapor at low pressure is about 2000 J/kg*K. Compare this with your calculation and comment on the actual role of vibrational motion.he molar mass of water is 18 g/mol.
