In the United States, most infections occur in endemic areas: California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and from northeastern Virginia to Maine. In 2011, 96 percent of Lyme disease cases were reported from those states. Fortunately for Montana, there is no evidence of endemic Lyme disease or Lyme-related ticks in our state. From 2003-2012, only 49 cases of Lyme disease were reported in Montana and all of the confirmed cases occurred in persons with a history of travel to areas with endemic Lyme disease.
