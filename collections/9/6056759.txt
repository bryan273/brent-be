Eczema - This is a broad disease condition that has many subtypes that are mostly characterized by itchy palms, feet, and the skin in general. A less common type of eczema is known for its hallmark symptoms of itchy palms and soles of the feet. This condition is known as dyshidrosis or palmoplantar dermatitis. The digits (fingers) also itch on their sides. The itchiness worsens during nighttime and during warm weather conditions.
