Though the symptoms are the same for women of all ages, the cancer is most likely to strike women after menopause. Ovarian cancer is most likely to cause pain in the pelvic and abdominal area, according to the CDC. But it can also cause low back pain or even pain in the legs. Sometimes it causes pain during sex. The pain is likely to be constant and to gradually worsen, according to the Mayo Clinic.
