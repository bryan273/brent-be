While competing systems offer a slew of sharp, fast prime lenses that are great in low light, Sony had relatively few options. Thatâ€™s changed over the last couple years, thanks to the introduction of lenses like the Sony E 35mm f/1.8 OSS (MSRP $449.99). This wide-aperture normal prime lens is compact, well-built, sharp, and (best of all) affordable. And unlike most fast primes, goes the extra mile by offering optical image stabilization.
