2 doctors agreed: Forehead injury fore: The bruising and swelling are not the concern. The forehead has a lot of blood vessels (very vascular) and small injuries can make big marks. At the beginning after the injury, it is important to watch for dizziness, vomiting, confusion and other signs of concussion. I hope this helps.
