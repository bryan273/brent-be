Lack of exercise. Women are often very busy and tend to take care of children and others before taking care of their own bodies. It’s important that you don’t allow your own health to fall the bottom of your to do list. If you’re fairly sedentary, this could also be a cause of constipation. Women who don’t get enough physical activity tend to have more problems in this area. By simply taking a walk each day you can get your bowels moving again. Many women also suffer from constipation because they avoid going when they feel the urge.
