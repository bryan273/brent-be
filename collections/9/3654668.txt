What does it mean if a dog is vomiting white foam? Another reason dogs vomit white foam is because of bilious vomiting syndrome, which usually occurs right after dogs wake up. Veterinarians believe that the syndrome is caused by too much stomach acid or other secretions that collect in the stomach and cause irritation.
