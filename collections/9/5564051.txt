Leg cramps — painful involuntary muscle contractions that typically affect the calf, foot or both — are common during pregnancy, often striking at night during the second and third trimesters. While the exact cause of leg cramps during pregnancy isn't clear, you can take steps to prevent them. Stretch your calf muscles. Although evidence is lacking, stretching before bed might help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy.
