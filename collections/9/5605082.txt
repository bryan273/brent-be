Add the potatoes to the boiling water. Blanch the potatoes for three to five minutes according to size -- three minutes for small potatoes and up to five minutes for large potatoes. Drain the potatoes and place them in the bowl of ice water. Let the potatoes sit until they're cool enough to handle, about 30 seconds, then remove.
