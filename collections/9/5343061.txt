The HLA gene family provides instructions for making a group of related proteins known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.HLA is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species.here are six main MHC class II genes in humans: HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present almost exclusively on the surface of certain immune system cells.
