Also known as: Stasis syndrome and Stagnant loop syndrome. Blind loop syndrome occurs when digested food slows or stops moving through part of the intestines. This causes an overgrowth of bacteria in the intestines. It also leads to problems absorbing nutrients. The name of this condition refers to the blind loop formed by part of the intestine that is bypassed.
