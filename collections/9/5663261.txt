Milk has a soothing effect on the stomach and throat, providing temporary relief. But milk also has a rebound effect that can cause heartburn later. Milk tends to encourage more stomach acid secretion, which contributes to acid reflux. It's better to sleep on an empty stomach or have a few wheat crackers before bedtime.
