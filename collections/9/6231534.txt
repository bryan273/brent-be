Normobaric hypoxic conditions corresponding to an altitude of 3,000 m (F i O2 = 14.5%) were simulated by diluting ambient air with nitrogen via a mixing chamber, with the dilution being constantly controlled by a P o 2 probe (Alti-Trainer 200, Sport and Medical Technology).ormobaric hypoxic conditions corresponding to an altitude of 3,000 m (F i O2 = 14.5%) were simulated by diluting ambient air with nitrogen via a mixing chamber, with the dilution being constantly controlled by a P o 2 probe (Alti-Trainer 200, Sport and Medical Technology).
