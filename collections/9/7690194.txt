Hypobaric Hypoxia. Hypobaric hypoxia is a condition where the body is deprived of a sufficient supply of oxygen from the air to supply for body tissues whether in quantity or molecular concentration.Hypoxic hypoxia affects the bodyâ€™s ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream.Oxygen is the main component required to maintain our body functions because it is involved in the oxidation of complex chemical food-stuff to produce energy for our other biological processes that happen inside our body.hen this occurs not enough oxygen is reaching the brain, as a consequence the body is not able to function efficiently or normally because of a lack of oxygen reaching the brain that requires a great deal of oxygen supply to kick-start its normal function to control and initiate other body functions.
