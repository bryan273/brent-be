Bananas. A just-ripe banana is another of the best foods for nausea, and I know of pediatricians and oncologists that both recommend them because of their gentleness and high potassium content. The strong scent of a very ripe banana might make nausea worse, so make sure you’re choosing a banana that’s just ripe.
