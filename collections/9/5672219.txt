Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water by 2 inches. Salt the water generously. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook the potatoes until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and put the potatoes in a serving bowl. Drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with parsley. Toss and serve.
