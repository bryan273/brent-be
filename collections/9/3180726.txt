4. Green or black tea. Tea bags are another popular home remedy. Green and black teas contain caffeine which constrict the tiny blood vessels in the skin around the eyes. Caffeinated tea also contains tannins which stimulate blood circulation. To make it work, place two tea bags in a mug of hot water. Remove and let the tea bags cool to room temperature and place on eyes for 15-30 minutes. Doing this once or twice a week can help tighten the skin under the eyes, as well as provide soothing benefits.
