Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar is another reason why you feel excessively hungry. Hypoglycemia symptoms such as hunger, fatigue, headache, cold sweats, confusion and mild tremors can be caused by over-exercising and not eating enough carbohydrates, starvation dieting, and alcohol addiction.ut if you have liver disease, the hypoglycemia becomes chronic and you have the urge to eat all the time. This is because the body usually produces sugar in the liver to avoid blood sugar levels falling. And if you have a liver disease, your liver wonâ€™t be able to produce sugar.
