Ultrasound detected papillary projections in 78% of tumors. Papillary projections were disseminated in 33% of malignant, 20% of borderline, and 0% of benign tumors (p = 0.0049). The mean size of the papillary projections was 9.6, 15.7, and 35.3 mm in benign, borderline, and malignant tumors, respectively (p = 0.0007).
