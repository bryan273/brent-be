My sister, Pat, usually boils the salt fish with cut limes. Many people boil it without limes, more than once, draining the water each time and adding fresh water to boil again, they repeat this process 2 to 3 times. Each time, the salt fish is boiled anywhere from 5 to 7 to 10 to 15 minutes. The length of time to boil depends on the thickness of the fish and the size of the piece of saltfish being boiled. What I do is soak the saltfish overnight in boiling water, drain it the next morning and shred it to bits or loosen it to make whatever dish I am preparing.
