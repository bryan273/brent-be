Add salt to the water, if desired. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium low. Cover the pot and simmer until potatoes are tenderâ€“about 15 to 20 minutes. A knife tip inserted into a potato should meet no resistance; if the potato clings to the knife, the potatoes need to cook longer. When potatoes are done, remove from heat and drain immediately.
