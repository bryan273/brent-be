1 Rocks that are being pulled apart are under tension (also called extension). Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries.  When forces act parallel to each other but in opposite directions, the stress is called shear (Figure 7.2). Shear stress causes two planes of material to slide past each other. This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries.
