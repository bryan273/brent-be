Thatâ€™s an increase from the 1 TB allowance Microsoft announced only four months ago for Office subscribers. It also comes on the heels of another change, in September, that removed the 2 GB file size limit for OneDrive uploads. The maximum size is now 10 GB. Prices for consumer Office 365 subscriptions start at $6.99 per month ($69.99 per year), and business subscriptions are as low as $100 a year. All of those offerings include the full set of Office desktop programs as well as rights to run Office on mobile devices such as the iPad.
