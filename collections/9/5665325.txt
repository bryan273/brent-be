Even so, eating too much of any kind of food—including protein—will eventually lead to weight gain. Plus, going too heavy on the stuff can have more serious health consequences. Too much protein might mess with your body's ability to metabolize glucose, and can also cause problems with kidney function, says study coauthor Mònica Bulló, PhD.
