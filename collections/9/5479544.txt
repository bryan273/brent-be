Visceral hypersensitivity basically means that the inside of your intestinal tract is 'touchier' than normal. Let's say you had a 'scale' in your GI tract that registered 'stretch' of the walls. If something move through them and a normal stretch of the walls produces no sensation except a slight feeling of 'something is there,' a person with visceral hypersensitivity will feel like the tract is being stretched to 2x it's normal diameter.
