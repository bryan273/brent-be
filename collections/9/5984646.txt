Premature babies are often more prone to infections that can cause deafness. They may also be born with severe jaundice or experience a lack of oxygen at some point. Both of these can cause deafness. In early childhood there is a range of things that can be responsible for a child becoming deaf. Infections like meningitis, measles and mumps can cause deafness. Ototoxic drugs, used to treat other types of infections in babies, can also be a cause.
