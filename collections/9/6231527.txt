Hypobaric Hypoxia. Hypobaric hypoxia is a condition where the body is deprived of a sufficient supply of oxygen from the air to supply for body tissues whether in quantity or molecular concentration.Hypoxic hypoxia affects the bodyâ€™s ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream.Oxygen is the main component required to maintain our body functions because it is involved in the oxidation of complex chemical food-stuff to produce energy for our other biological processes that happen inside our body.ypoxia can lead to a loss of cognition, which can be detrimental, particularly for pilots who have to make important decisions that affect the safety of all passengers and crewmembers onboard. A total absence of oxygen in the human body is called anoxia.
