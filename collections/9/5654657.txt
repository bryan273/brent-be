The inventor of the polio vaccine didn't patent it. Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine in 1953 but never patented it. He believed that, like the sun, a vaccine for polio belonged to the people. Salk tested the vaccine on himself and his own family first and later went on to work on a cure for AIDS.
