As well as dizziness, vertigo and hearing problems, labyrinthitis may cause pain in the ears, nausea, a fever, sight problems and neck pain. There may also be fluid or pus seeping out of an ear. A doctor will diagnose labyrinthitis based on the symptoms a person describes, a physical examination and other tests.
