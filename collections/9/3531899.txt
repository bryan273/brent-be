You want to be careful where you put the oil. The way you do it is tie a piece of thread tightly around the base of the skin tag as close to the skin as possible. Then daily you add a drop of oregano oil onto the skin tag. Depending on how big it is will dictate how long it will take for the skin tag to fall off. Some take a week. Some take two weeks.
