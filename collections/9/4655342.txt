Early Pregnancy Symptoms. Many women do not encounter any early pregnancy symptoms. A missed or late period are one of the first signs these women experience. A period that is a week late can be a serious surprise. Most of the earliest symptoms are very vague. It is easy to confuse a mild stomach bug or pre-menstrual cramping as signs of pregnancy. If you believe that you are pregnant, see a doctor for a blood test to officially confirm it.
