Pell Grant funds are not sent directly to you. Rather, they are sent to the school listed on your application for aid and applied toward tuition costs. If your costs do not equal the amount of the Pell Grant, the unused portion will be returned and not given to you.Pell Grant funds can never be used to pay personal expenses.rants and scholarships are obviously preferable to loans if you are going to seek financial aid. You do not need to pay these monies back, and you can use them for a variety of educational purposes including tuition, books, and living expenses. However, not all grants or scholarships are available at all schools.
