Recurring Cold Symptoms - going on 3 months!! I know there has been this awful virus floating around, but I have been struggling with nasal congestion, post nasal drip, and a constant cough. It all started right after Christmas when I got the worst of it! Very dry dark green mucus, soar throat, and dry painful cough.
