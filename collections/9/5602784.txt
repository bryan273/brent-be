According to the most recent figures from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), plastic surgeons' fees for a nose job average approximately $3,800. This figure does not include the cost of anesthesia or the surgical facility. The total cost of rhinoplasty usually falls between $4,000 and $9,000. If you are considering undergoing this cosmetic procedure, ask your surgeon for a comprehensive price quote, including not only your doctor's own fee but also these additional charges.
