Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea if you have IBS. Eating foods that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables, may help. Fiber may improve constipation symptoms caused by IBS because it makes stool soft and easier to pass.
