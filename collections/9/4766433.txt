Medications such as clomipramine, which block the serotonin pump, are referred to as serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SRIs. In addition to clomipramine, several selective SRIs have been shown effective in treating OCD, including fluvoxamine (Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil).
