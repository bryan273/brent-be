For Long Term Storage (more than three weeks): Wrap bread tightly in plastic wrap. Then, wrap it again in foil or freezer paper. Write the date on your bread before sticking it in the freezer; then, try to use it within six months. For Rolls and Buns: Place them inside a freezer bag, and seal tightly.
