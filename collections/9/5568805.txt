Confidence votes 44.9K. A crack high lasts about as long as a cocaine high does (since crack is just a diluted, easier-to-smoke form of cocaine). Which is not very long.The effects of one line of cocaine, or one hit of crack, last about 20 to 30 minutes, and then you have to take another line, or another hit, to keep the high going.When you finally stop taking lines or hits, you'll start coming down (the feeling of euphoria will start wearing off) in about 20 to 30 minutes.onfidence votes 44.9K.
