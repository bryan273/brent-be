But more importantly, the MUGA scan gives an accurate and reproducible means of measuring and monitoring the “ejection fraction” of the cardiac ventricles. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an excellent, and the most commonly used, measure of overall cardiac function. The ejection fraction is simply the proportion of blood that is expelled from the ventricle with each heart beat. So, for instance, if the left ventricle ejects 60% of its blood volume with each beat, the LVEF is 0.6.
