So, why do people burp? Is burping a reflex body response or is it done intentionally? There are people who burp on purpose by gulping air into their system. However, in general, people burp for very basic health reasons. A burp, otherwise known as belch, is nothing but gas that your body needs to get rid of. It is also defined as the expulsion of air or gas within your body through the mouth. When you eat or drink, especially carbonated drinks, you donâ€™t just swallow the food or liquid, but you also swallow air simultaneously.
