In older men, physical problems are often -- but not always -- responsible for erectile dysfunction (ED). Cardiovascular conditions like high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and heart disease can cause arteries to clog, reducing blood flow to the penis and impairing a man's ability to achieve an erection. Nerve damage from diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or treatments for prostate cancer can also interfere with erections.
