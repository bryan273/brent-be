In brief: UTI. This varies with the type of uti, the antibiotic employed and its efficacy against the causative organism, the immune status and anatomical integrity of the urinary tract and other factors. Generally acute cystitis will begin to resolve symptomatically within 24-48 hrs after beginning appropriate treatment.
