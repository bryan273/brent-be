Other types of strep that can sometimes infect the throat are groups C and G strep bacteria.A strep infection causes the throat (pharynx) and the tonsils or adenoids to become irritated, inflamed, and painful.ow the strep infection is spread. Strep throat can be passed from person to person. When a person infected with strep throat breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the strep bacteria are released into the air and are breathed in by other people.
