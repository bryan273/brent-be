So the basic difference in BWR and PWR lies in the fact that while steam is produced in a pressure vessel in BWR, hot water passes into a steam generator in the case of a PWR. In brief: PWR vs BWR. • BWR stands for Boiling Water reactor while PWR refers to Pressurized Water Reactor. • In BWR, pressure vessel is used to make steam whereas there is a steam generator in PWR. • More than 70% of the nuclear power generators that use light water are PWR in US.
