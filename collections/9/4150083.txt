Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of. 119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure. 140/90 or higher is high blood pressure. Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension. Prehypertension means you may end up with high blood pressure, unless you take steps to prevent it.
