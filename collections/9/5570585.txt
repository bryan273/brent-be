White oak is denser than red oak and is an excellent choice for a cutting board. While any wood can be used the goal is resistance to damage caused by the knife. Hard maple seems to be the overall favorite choice. too have read of the mineral oil choice. My daughter has a home-made oak cutting board that over about five years of use has developed a lovely dark patina. I suspect she has never re-oiled it. But hot soapy water seems to be all that it needs to keep it clean.
