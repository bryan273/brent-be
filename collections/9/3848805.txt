What Are the Symptoms of Miscarriage? Typically, the symptoms of a miscarriage worsen as the miscarriage progresses. Spotting turns into heavier bleeding; cramping starts and becomes stronger. Among pregnant women, any of the following symptoms may indicate miscarriage: Vaginal bleeding or spotting, with or without cramps; this bleeding may occur very early in your pregnancy-- even before you miss your menstrual period and know that you are pregnant -- or it may occur later, after you know you are pregnant.
