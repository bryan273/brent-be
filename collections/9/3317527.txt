If heart disease runs in your family, especially if someone in your family had a heart attack in their 20s or 30s, then the chances that this is heart disease is greater. Most likely this chest pain is coming from a strained muscle, or an inflamed joint, and it gets worse when you lift something heavy. Your shortness of breath and sweatiness can be do to the pain itself. Dizziness can occur simply because you are hyperventilating when the pain comes on.
