Brain Aneurysm Symptoms & Signs. A brain aneurysm is a bulging area within the wall of an artery that supplies the brain. In most cases, brain aneurysms do not produce symptoms. In some cases, the aneurysm may cause symptoms by pushing on other areas of the brain. Depending on the size of the aneurysm and the area involved, these symptoms can include headaches, neck pain, blurred vision, and speech changes.
