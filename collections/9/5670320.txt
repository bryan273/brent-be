According to my friend who is also a doctor, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is associated with dry eyes and puffy eyelids. My understanding is that the eye symptoms do not always occur in every individual with the diagnosis. She also stated that other forms of hypothyroidism can be associated with dry eye.
