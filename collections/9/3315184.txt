If the diastolic pressure is too low (known as hypotension or low blood pressure), the blood is not able to bring oxygen and nutrients to all the body's cells and remove waste matter. This can cause the cells to die. The diastolic blood pressure is considered low when the blood pressure reading is below 60. If the diastolic blood pressure is too high, a person is said to have high blood pressure, which is also known as hypertension. High blood pressure means that the diastolic blood pressure reading is higher than 90.
