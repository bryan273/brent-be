It is important to serve cooked eggs immediately because of the possibility of contamination from bacteria like salmonella. Such contamination can cause food poisoning. Soft-boiled or cooked eggs should be re-boiled within 2 hours of boiling for the first time. To re-boil the eggs after more than 2 hours, refrigerate them first instead of letting them sit out. Then, take them out of the refrigerator and re-boil them, consuming them shortly thereafter.
