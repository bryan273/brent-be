Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count greater than 400 Ã— 109/L. In routine clinical practice, thrombocytosis is much more likely to be reactive (> 80% of cases) than primary. Reactive thrombocytosis is usually associated with infections, inflammation, trauma, hemolysis, metastatic cancer, the postsplenectomy state, or iron deficiency anemia.
