Clinical Significance of Premature Atrial Complex (PAC) 1  PACs are a normal electrophysiological phenomenon not usually requiring investigation or treatment. 2  Frequent PACs may cause palpitations and a sense of the heart “skipping a beat”. In patients with underlying predispositions (e.g. left atrial enlargement, ischaemic heart disease, WPW), a PAC may be the trigger for the onset of a re-entrant tachydysrhythmia — e.g. AF, flutter, AVNRT, AVRT.
