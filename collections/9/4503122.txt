One of the more common causes of pain in the back of the knee joint, specifically, is a popliteal synovial cyst, which is also known as a bakerâ€™s cyst. This fluid-filled cyst at the back of the leg often forms in response to arthritis or other cartilage damage. The bulge creates a feeling of tightness behind the knee as well as stiffness and swelling and pain behind the knee and calf. For many, this pain intensifies when flexing or fully extending the leg.
