Vasodepressor syncope is a common medical problem that can usually be diagnosed through an accurate history and upright tilt testing. In most cases, long-term therapy is not necessary, and the majority of patients experience a striking decrease in syncopal episodes following a tilt test and the ensuing reassuring explanation from their physician.
