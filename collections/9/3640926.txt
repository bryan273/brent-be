Osteomyelitis (Bone Infection). Osteomyelitis is the medical term for a bone infection. Bone infections are caused when a break in the skin allows germs, usually bacteria, to spread into bone tissue. Bacteria can also spread from infections in other parts of the body by traveling through the blood to infect a bone.
