Dermatitis and other immune system disorders, such as eczema or psoriasis can cause excessive skin peeling on feet. These auto-immune diseases cause the skin cells to die and shed too quickly, causing excessive scaling, flaking, or peeling of the skin. Dermatitis-induced skin peeling may occur in between the toes, the bottom of the feet, both sides of the feet, or on the skin of the hands.
