INTERESTING TIDBIT FOR YOU - do not drink cold liquids with your meals... I read this today... apparently food digests better at room temperatures and drinking cold liquids with your meals slows down digestion and can potentially increase the amount of foods that will be converted to fat....WOW... I guess that really rules out icecream for me....LOL.
