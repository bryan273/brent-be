A blood pregnancy test will show a positive result about 3-4 days after implantation and a urine test will show a positive result about 4-5 days after implantation. Just remember that the pregnancy hormone hCG will double every other day-so if you get a negative result don't be afraid to retest in a few days. If you are choosing to take a urine test before you actually miss your period, remember to test with first morning urine so that hormone levels are the most concentrated. If you do notice implantation bleeding, there's really no need to contact your doctor unless you have been instructed to do so.
