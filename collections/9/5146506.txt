Child Care Services Inclusion. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 protects children with disabilities and requires child care providers to serve children with disabilities if reasonable accommodations can be made. Child care providers cannot charge parents for the cost of making such accommodations available. TWC provides a higher amount of child care assistance funding (the inclusion assistance rate) for families we serve who have qualifying children with disabilities.
