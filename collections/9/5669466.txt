Add onion slices, garlic, salt and black pepper to the pot. Pierce the casing of the brats several times, then add to the pot. Allow beer to boil again, adjust heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes. Pre-heat the indoor or outdoor grill to medium heat. Carefully remove brats from the beer and pat dry.
