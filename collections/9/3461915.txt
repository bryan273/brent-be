Arthritis, or joint inflammation, can cause localized swelling in the foot or ankle. Osteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis that may cause occasional swelling, usually in a single joint. Gout is another form of arthritis that typically causes a very painful, red, swollen big toe joint. Gout can also affect the ankle. Some autoimmune diseases cause swelling and arthritis that affect both feet equally, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome).
