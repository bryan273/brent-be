Hypovolemia can interfere with the amount of blood that the heart can pump and deliver to other organs in the body. This means that hypovolemia can cause a number of signs and symptoms related to the heart. One of the signs and symptoms of hypovolemia is tachycardia (Nursing, 2000). Tachycardia is the medical term for rapid heartbeat (Mayo Clinic).
