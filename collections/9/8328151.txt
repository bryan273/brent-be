One of the most common causes of this type of watery eye problem is called ectropion. This condition is a drooping and pulling away of the lower eyelid. It is usually seen in older people who gradually develop a weakness of the lower lid. Ectropion may cause the eyes to be dry, sore, red, and burning.
