What is tingling in both feet? Tingling in both feet can have a number of causes, including an injury, sitting in one position for a long period of time, or a circulation problem that impairs blood flow to the feet. Tingling in both feet can also be caused by nerve damage from extreme heat or cold or from toxic substances. Alternatively, tingling in both feet may be caused by peripheral neuropathy, a disorder in which the peripheral nerves that relay signals between the body and the brain and spinal cord lose function. Peripheral neuropathy can be due to a number of specific diseases and disorders, including diabetes and alcoholism.
