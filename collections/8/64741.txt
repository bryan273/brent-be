Add that to the low costs of living on base and an attractive retirement package, and you can see the big-picture benefits of life as an Officer in the Air Force. As a lieutenant straight out of college, you will make about $34,000 a year in basic pay. As an officer, your pay depends on your rank and time in service. If you’re a doctor or pilot, there are some special pay considerations and bonuses. In four years, you can be making $47,000–$55,000 as a captain.
