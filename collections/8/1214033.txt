A fluttering heart or heart flutter is commonly used to describe certain chest symptoms or cardiovascular conditions. It is not a specific medical term but in most instances it describes palpitations â€“ the perception of the heart beating harder or faster. The term fluttering heart referring to palpitations must also be differentiated from a medical condition known as atrial flutter which is a type of abnormal rhythm of the heart.
