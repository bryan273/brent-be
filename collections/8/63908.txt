That's why recycling aluminum is such a boon for the environment. Aluminum is considered a sustainable metal, which means it can be recycled again and again with no loss of material. And it has never been cheaper, faster or more energy efficient to recycle aluminum than it is today. Aluminum cans are 100-percent recyclable, making them the most recyclable of all materials. The aluminum can you toss into your recycling bin today will be completely recycled and back on the store shelf in just 60 days.
