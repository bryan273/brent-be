Anterior knee pain. Knee pain felt at the front of the knee, around the kneecap, is called anterior knee pain or patellofemoral pain syndrome. It's not always obvious why this pain develops, but it's been linked to previous injuries, overuse of your knees, muscle weakness and your kneecap being slightly out of place.
