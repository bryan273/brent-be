Alibaba shares are at an all-time low â€” and people are asking questions about fake customers. (REUTERS/Ruben Sprich) Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group. Alibaba shares are at an all-time low. On Tuesday, shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant were down more than 2.5% to trade below $82 for the first time since the company went public in September. Since hitting their all-time highs in early November, shares of the company are down more than 30%. And a report in The Wall Street Journal published on Monday certainly isn't helping the stock.
