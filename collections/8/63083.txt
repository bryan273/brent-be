A height of two inches is fine when grasses are rapidly growing, but the height should be raised as growth slows, stress increases, and when the lawn is in shade. Lawns should be mowed according to the rate of grass growth; remember not to remove more than one-third of the grass leaf in any one cutting. Mowing as the lawn needs it is essential. In the spring, this will likely mean more than once a week. It is never advisable to mow when the grass is wet. Another issue related to mowing is whether clippings should be collected.
