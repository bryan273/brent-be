Blade Implants. Blade implants are a type of endosseous implant (placed in the bone). Blade Implants are flat titanium Implants with one or two metal prongs on one long side. A blade implant is placed in the jaw so that the prong(s) stick out into the mouth where they will support Crowns or Bridges. Blade Implants are usually used in the back of the mouth where a patient has no teeth. Blade Implants are extremely robust, especially where there are greater forces on the teeth at the back of the mouth.
