Ovarian cancer may not cause any specific symptoms, particularly in its early stages. When it does cause symptoms, these may be nonspecific and vague. Symptoms can include: abdominal enlargement or swelling, abdominal fullness, early satiety (feeling full early), changes in bowel or bladder habits, or. clothes not fitting well.
