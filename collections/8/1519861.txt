In other studies, each participant consumed the same amount of oil regardless of calorie intake. In one study, overweight or obese people taking 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of coconut oil per day for 4 weeks lost an average of 1.1 inches (2.87 cm) from their waists (5). Whatâ€™s more, the participants lost this weight without deliberately restricting calories or increasing physical activity (5).
