Answers from James M. Steckelberg, M.D. Yes, men can get yeast infections, too, which can lead to a condition known as balanitis — inflammation of the head of the penis. Yeast infections in men are common because the fungus that causes yeast infections (candida) is normally present on skin, especially moist skin. When some contributing factor — such as having sex with a female partner who has a vaginal yeast infection — causes an overgrowth of candida, infection can result.
