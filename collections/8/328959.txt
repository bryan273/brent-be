Bald eagles have also been seen stealing prey from other birds in mid-air, particularly osprey. Bald eagles are among the largest raptors in the United States, second only to the California Condor. They measure from 28 - 40 inches in length, or about 2.5 - 3.5 feet. The wingspan can reach from 72 - 90 inches, or 6 - 7.5 feet. Females of this species are slightly larger than the males.
