Night sweats, or excess sweating during the night, is a classic symptom many women experience during menopause. However, a woman's night sweats in her 40s and 50s arenâ€™t always due to menopause. It could be as simple as the bedroom being too hot or using a duvet with too high a tog rating for the time of year.
