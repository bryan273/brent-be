Kittens less than 2 weeks of age should be fed every 3–4 hours, while kittens of 2–4 weeks of age can usually be fed every 6–8 hours. The milk should be warmed to 95–100 °F (35.0–37.8 °C) before feeding (about the same temperature as the skin of the human forearm). Check the warmth of the milk on back of your hand.
