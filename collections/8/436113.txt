This type of deficiency can cause a noticeably sore tongue that may feel like it is burning. Food allergies are another major cause of this burning tongue sensation, in addition to sensitivity to certain mouthwashes and toothpastes. Smoking and excessive alcohol intake can also have detrimental effects upon your tongue.
