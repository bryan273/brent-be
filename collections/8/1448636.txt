Avoid trans fats. As mentioned above, omega-3 fatty acids help to reduce intraocular pressure. However, foods that are high in trans fats prevent the omega-3s from working properly, which can lead to increased eye pressure. As a result, it's a good idea to limit your intake of foods rich in trans fats.
