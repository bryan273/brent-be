Massive ‘ocean’ discovered towards Earth’s core. Blue lagoon: this crystal of blue ringwoodite is being crushed in a lab experiment. A reservoir of water three times the volume of all the oceans has been discovered deep beneath the Earth’s surface. The finding could help explain where Earth’s seas came from. The water is hidden inside a blue rock called ringwoodite that lies 700 kilometres underground in the mantle, the layer of hot rock between Earth’s surface and its core. The huge size of the reservoir throws new light on the origin of Earth’s water.
