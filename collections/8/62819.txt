For as long as anyone reading this has been alive, the president has had a wife and that wife was the first lady. The last bachelor elected to the White House was Grover Cleveland in 1886, but he married in his first term. James Buchanan, elected in 1857, was the only unmarried president to stay single his whole life. Buchanan never had a wife, but he still had a first lady. The job went to his niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, who assumed the role of White House hostess and used her proximity to power to champion several social causes.
