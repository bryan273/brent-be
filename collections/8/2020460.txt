Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is caused by a problem in the inner ear. Tiny calcium stones inside your inner ear canals help you keep your balance. Normally, when you move a certain way, such as when you stand up or turn your head, these stones move around.
