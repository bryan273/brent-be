Please note that rohypnol is not the only drug associated with date rape and there have been cases linked to GHB and other sedative drugs. Rohypnol has also been used in combination with other drugs to enhance the effects of low grade heroin, to mellow the buzz from crack and heroin, and to soften comedowns. The drug has also acquired a reputation as a party drug, sometimes dubbed the 'love drug'.
