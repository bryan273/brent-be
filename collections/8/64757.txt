Ibrahim Hughes Investor from Union, New Jersey. I'm working a deal with an abandoned property that has an old Associates Financial Services Company attached. It originated in 1990 and I was under the impression, from researching my county recorder's office and from my experience, that these liens were being handled by Citifinancial.
