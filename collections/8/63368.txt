Red blood cells are the oxygen carrying cells. They can take two weeks or longer to fully return to normal. You can donate platelets (apheresis donation) every two weeks â€“ up to 24 times in 12 months. Platelet and plasma components are regenerated in the body more quickly than red cells. Platelets will return to normal levels within 24-48 hours of donating.
