Delayed cerebral ischaemia. Delayed cerebral ischaemia, or vasospasm, is another serious and common complication of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. This is when the supply of blood to the brain becomes dangerously low, disrupting the normal functions of the brain and causing brain damage. It's most common a few days after the first haemorrhage.
