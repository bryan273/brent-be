I argue that not only does Canada accept too many immigrants for its own good, it is importing them from too few source countries.According to this report it appears a growing number of Canadians agree.hen we add in the rest of the Asian nations approximately half of all immigrants to Canada, if not more, come from one region of the world. Simply stated Canada is importing too many Asian immigrants.
