Caring For An Orphaned Kitten. 1  Sometimes you find a stray kitten, a litter of kittens or even a stray mother with an entire litter. If you find a mother with more than one or two kittens in the litter, they may be too much for you to handle so you might be best off to take it to the local Humane Society or Animal Shelter.
