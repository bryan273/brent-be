There’s a cheat meal and there’s a cheat day(s). And the latter—going nuts on the weekend because you’ve been on-point with your diet during the week—is never a good idea. A solid diet and exercise program will help you lose 1 to 2 pounds per week—a deficit of about 3,500 to 7,000 calories. Consider the average sit-down restaurant meal serves up 1,200 calories, and it’s easy to see how cheating too big or too frequently, can undo your weight loss efforts in a matter of hours.
