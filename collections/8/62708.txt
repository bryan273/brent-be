While both types of compounds make up the basis of chemistry, the two types are rather different. The main difference is in the presence of a carbon atom; organic compounds will contain a carbon atom (and often a hydrogen atom, to form hydrocarbons), while almost all inorganic compounds do not contain either of those two atoms. While most inorganic compounds do not contain carbon, there are a few that do.
