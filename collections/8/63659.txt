Mortgage insurance is required if you have less than 20% equity (or down payment) in your home and protects the mortgage lender from losses if a customer is unable to make payments and defaults on the loan. There are two types of mortgage insurance, Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) and Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP).
