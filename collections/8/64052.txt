There's no question that the aging process can lead to a decrease in skin elasticity and the very things you describe. There is also some evidence that estrogen increases collagen in the skin and the thickness of the skin, which would mean that a deficiency in estrogen may negatively affect the skin.But the studies showing these results are small, and there are currently no rigorous studies testing the effects of estrogen on the skin.o even though estrogen levels drop after menopause, loss of skin elasticity is not a reason to take hormone therapy. There are risks associated with this therapy, and the only clear indication for taking systemic hormone therapy is if you have hot flashes and night sweats.
