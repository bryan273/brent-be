Burning eyes describes a feeling of burning and irritation of the eyes. Burning eyes can be accompanied by itching, tearing, or discharge from the eyes. Burning eyes have many possible causes. One of the most common is exposure to environmental pollutants such as tobacco smoke, smog, or dust. Chemicals found in household cleaning solvents, such as bleach, soap and shampoo, can lead to burning eyes. Chlorine in swimming pools can also make your eyes burn.
