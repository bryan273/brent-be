In the first stage of cirrhosis, there are usually no symptoms, and liver functioning isn't measurably impaired. The disease shows up in blood tests only. The second stage of cirrhosis involves the formation of scar tissue into fibrous masses. This syndrome is called fibrosis and it can exist as a liver disease in itself, without a diagnosis of cirrhosis. In the second stage, liver functioning begins to be impaired to the point of producing some symptoms, such as jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and swelling of different parts of the body.
