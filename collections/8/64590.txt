Cozumel cruise. Cozumel. The land of the swallows. A forty-kilometre-long island directly off the coast from Playa del Carmen, Isla Cozumel is a renowned cruise-ship call: nearly every day, up to ten cruise ships dock at one of the islandâ€™s three dedicated piers, all just south of the only town, San Miguel.
