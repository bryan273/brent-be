flat fee: a set amount of money upfront thatâ€™s yours to keep. The amount does not change no matter how well the book sells. For example, if your flat fee is $10,000, the amount remains the same no matter if the book sells 10 copies or 10 million. royalties: a small amount paid to you for every book sold.
