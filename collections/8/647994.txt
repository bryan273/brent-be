Heart Problems. MayoClinic.com says that low blood pressure can be caused by a number of heart problems or defects. A low heart rate, also known as bradycardia, can cause a drop in blood pressure. Diastolic pressure can also be affected by heart valve problems, a heart attack or heart failure. In these situations, the heart cannot circulate the amount of blood that is needed.
