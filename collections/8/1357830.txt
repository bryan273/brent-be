It is not always possible to determine what causes low levels of amniotic fluid. Oligohydramnios can be caused by a continuous leaking of amniotic fluid. It can also occur when the fetus has kidney failure. After about four months of pregnancy, the kidneys of a normal fetus will produce the amniotic fluid. If the fetus has kidney abnormalities, the amount of amniotic fluid may be too low.
