Lemon juice is less acidic than the gastric acid -- primarily Hydrochloric acid -- already present in the body. Gastric acid has a pH of between 1-2. Lemon juice has a pH of 2-3. That will dilute (i.e., lower the acidity) of stomach acid, but that acid will be neutralized in the small intestine by the presence of and production of bicarbonates. There is no significant effect on the body's acidity from consuming lemon juice.
