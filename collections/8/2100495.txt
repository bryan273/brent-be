The Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Diopter, in optics, unit of magnifying power of a lens or lens system. Because the power of a lens is proportional to unity (one) divided by the focal length (see lens), the power of a lens in diopters is numerically equal to 1 m divided by the focal length in metres.
