Stool is usually some shade of brown and can be influenced by what you eat. Stool that is light-colored (either pale, white, gray or clay colored) is not considered normal if it occurs frequently. Bile salts give stool its characteristic brown color. If there is decreased bile flow caused by a condition affecting your gallbladder, liver, or pancreas (such as cholecystitis, gallstones, giardia, hepatitis, chronic pancreatitis, or cirrhosis), there may be a lack of bile in stool, making them pale or clay colored.
