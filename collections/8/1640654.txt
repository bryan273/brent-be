A bounding pulse is also a common response to stress and anxiety, so if you are experiencing (for example) extra stress at work or anxiety over a bill, you might feel a bounding pulse. Drinking caffeine and taking stimulants (such as those in asthma medication) can also cause your pulse to speed up.
