Mind you, these are merely my own words, but I really do think it is that important. Now, in every genre of art, negative space has a slightly different form. For example, pause can be seen as the negative space in sound art. But we are not interested in sound art, we are interested in photography. And in this genre, negative space is basically the space that surrounds the main element of interest, which itself can be called positive space.
