Notice if your child has difficulty pronouncing words. Dyslexia causes the brain to scramble and reverse letters inside words which can make it impossible to distinguish words and sentences. Monitor your child's reading habits.eading can be extremely frustrating with dyslexia and is often avoided at all costs. Have your child try to pronounce a few words for you. If they are way off it's a good chance dyslexia is reversing or mixing the letters up. Have your child take a dyslexia test.
