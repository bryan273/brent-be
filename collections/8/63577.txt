Growing Requirements for Peace Lily Plants Unfortunately, Peace Lilies are only hardy in USDA zones 10-11. Most tropical house plants should be re-potted every 2-3 years, to freshen and revitalize their soil. The tip burn could be caused by over feeding, or chlorine in the water. Peace Lilies will grow and flourish in almost any well drained soil. However, it is always the best idea to use a good commercial soil mix containing peat moss, bark and sand. Peace Lily Plants prefer bright filtered light, but will survive in low interior light. Peace lilies grow best in a warm environment with 68°-85° daytime temperatures and 10° cooler at night. Keep your plants out of drafts, and never expose your plant to extended periods below 40 degrees. Feed your Peace Lily every 2-3 months, using a ½ strength solution of a balanced, soluble house plant fertilizer. Over fertilizing can burn the leaf tips and the roots.
