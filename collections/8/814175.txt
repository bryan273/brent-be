A coma occurs when a part of the brain is damaged, either temporarily or permanently. This damage results in unconsciousness, an inability to awake, and unresponsiveness to stimuli such as pain, sound, and light. Comas have a number of potential causes. These range from injury or illness to stroke, to tumors, to alcohol and drug abuse. A person who is in a coma is alive but is unable to move at will. They canâ€™t think, speak, or respond to their environment.
