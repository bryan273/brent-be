Residential: We require energy on a constant basis to heat our water, cook our food, warm our homes, and generate our electricity. Natural gas is one of the least expensive forms of energy available to Alberta residential consumers. The most common use for natural gas around the home is for furnaces and hot water tanks. Natural gas can also be used to operate various household appliances, including stoves, clothes dryers, fireplaces, and barbecues.
