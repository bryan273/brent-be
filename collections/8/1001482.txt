However, colic in neonatal ruminants is most often a result of increased abomasal or intestinal gas. In cattle between 1 and 6 months of age, perforating ulcers can also be a cause of colic. In adult cattle, the most common causes of colic include intestinal intussusceptions, intestinal obstructions, ruptured bladders, peritonitis, abomasal ulcer, abomasal torsion, hardware disease, and severe bloat.
