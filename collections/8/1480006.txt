My HR dept has explained our maternity leave policy as follows: Employee may take up to 8 weeks paid for maternity leave, and another 4 unpaid under FMLA for a total of 12 weeks. First, the employee must surrender all vacation and sick time for the year (not just what has been accrued) at the beginning of the leave.So for example, each year i have 2 weeks vacation time, and 2 weeks sick time...this is accrued monthly 6.67 hrs/each.HR says that i must surrender all 4 weeks at the time of leave (due in March)- those 4 weeks will be paid at 100%, and the remaining 4 weeks will be paid 80% under the STD policy.irst, the employee must surrender all vacation and sick time for the year (not just what has been accrued) at the beginning of the leave.
