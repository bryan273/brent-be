When the sodium concentration of the solution is equivalent to that of the (red blood) cell, the solution is called isotonic. Intravascular administration of isotonic crystalloids (eg, lactated Ringerâ€™s, 0.9% saline) will result in interstitial volume replacement and minimal intracellular fluid accumulation.
