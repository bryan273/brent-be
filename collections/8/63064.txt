About BJ's. In June of 1990 our family opened BJ's Pizza & Subs in the Pine Street Mini- Mall along with three other new businesses including the Market Place. We started with two tables and about 800 square feet. The menu was small but we were determined to provide quality foods that were impossible to find in the area at the time.
