Excessive amounts of wound exudate can cause the periwound (within 4 cm of wound edge) skin to become macerated and even break down. This type of skin damage is call periwound moisture-associated dermatitis. The chemical composition of the wound exudate greatly affects the potential damage that can be wrought.
