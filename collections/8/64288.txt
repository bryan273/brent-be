Causes of Eclampsia. Exactly what causes eclampsia is not fully understood. Factors that may contribute are blood vessel problems, disorders of the brain or nervous system, genetics and diet. Eclampsia arises from preeclampsia, a form of gestational hypertension, so women with a history of preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy or with a history of high blood pressure are at higher risk.
