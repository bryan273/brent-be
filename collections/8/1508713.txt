Cancer is the transformation of normal cells. The transformed cells grow and multiply abnormally. Left untreated, these cancers grow and eventually spread through the colon wall to involve the adjacent lymph nodes and organs. Ultimately, they spread to distant organs such as the liver, lungs, brain, and bones.
