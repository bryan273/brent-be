Syncope is temporary loss of consciousness and posture, described as fainting or passing out.. It's usually related to temporary insufficient blood flow to the brain. It most often occurs when the blood pressure is too low (hypotension) and the heart doesn't pump a normal supply of oxygen to the brain.
