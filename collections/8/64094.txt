We tend to use untenable in situations where an idea or position is so off base that holding on to it is unjustified or inexcusable. One way to hold on to the meaning of untenable is to associate it with other tenÄ“re descendants whose meanings are associated with holding or holding on to. Tenacious (holding fast) is one example. Others are contain, detain, sustain, maintain, and retain.
