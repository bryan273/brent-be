Cell phone crashes are under-reported. We know cell phone-related car crashes are a problem. We just don't know how big the problem is. Unfortunately, no breathalyzer-like test exists for cell phone use behind the wheel and drivers in crashes are often reluctant to admit use. This creates a huge gap in the data.
