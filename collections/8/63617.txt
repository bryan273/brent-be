A home pregnancy test is a quick and easy way for a woman to find out if she might be having a baby. The do-it-yourself kits, which are sold over-the-counter at drug stores, grocery stores and discount stores, check a woman's urine and can detect a pregnancy in its early weeks not long after she misses her period.
