A specialized form of VRT is available to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This treatment is often referred to as the Epley maneuver, and involves a series of specifically patterned head and trunk movements to move tiny displaced otoliths to a place in the inner ear where they canâ€™t cause symptoms.
