This study finds an effect at 200mg a day. Caffeine takes longer to be broken down in the body during pregnancy and it reaches the baby through the placenta. The developing baby is not great at processing caffeine and it can increase the baby's levels of stress hormones. This latest study found that babies of women whose caffeine intake was 100mg a day had birth weights of 21 to 28g less than babies of women who didn't have as much.
