Welcome to the NKI Proteinuria Resource Center. The purpose of the Proteinuria Resource Center site is to provide information on an early warning sign of chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria. Many people are not aware they may be at risk for serious health problems, because there are so few early warning signs or symptoms of CKD.
