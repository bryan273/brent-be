The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is the go-to screening test for lupus. If the result is negative, says Dr. Gilkeson, you can almost guarantee that a patient doesn’t have lupus. On the other hand, a positive result is much less clear; 90% to 95% of people who have a positive ANA test don’t have lupus.
