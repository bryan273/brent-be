Single-ply rubber roofing (roll roofing) typically costs $2.50 to $5.00 per square foot installed, although high-end materials and/or a tricky installation could bump the price up to as much as $10.00 or more per square foot. For a 1,500 square foot roof, that's an estimated rubber roof cost of $4,000 to $15,000. Rubber roof shingles cost $4.00 to $8.00 per square foot, ($6,000 to $12,000 for a 1,500 square foot roof).
