Removing irritants and allergens from your environment may relieve an itchy nose. Common triggers include dust, animal dander, food sources and chemical irritants, such as those found in cleaning supplies. Lotions or Ointments. The problem of external nasal itching is often caused by dry skin. Applying a mild lotion or ointment to the skin will lubricate it and relieve itching. Over-the-counter topical steroid creams like cortisone can also relieve itching of external skin on the nose. Consult a physician before applying steroid-based creams and ointments to the skin. Consulting a Doctor. If remedies for an itchy nose do not provide relief or if the cause of the itch is not easily determined, consult with a doctor. When nasal itching is caused by a more complex problem, it may need to be addressed with prescribed medication or other treatment.
