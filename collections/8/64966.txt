This was a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, as the nation began the third bloody year of the Civil War. The Proclamation declared all persons held as slaves within Rebel states are, and henceforward shall be free.. The Proclamation also announced the acceptance of black men into the Union Army and Navy. By the end of the Civil War, almost 200,000 black soldiers and sailors had fought on the side of the Union.
