For the purpose of the Special Retirement Supplement (SRS), an SCE is an employee who can voluntarily retire at an age under their Minimum Retirement Age (MRA). Those would be law enforcement officers, firefighters, and some military technicians. Second, a review of the Special Retirement Supplement is in order. The SRS is a payment that is made by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and is designed to approximate the amount of an age 62 Social Security benefit that is due to civilian service under the FERS retirement system. Most FERS retirees begin receiving the SRS at their Minimum Retirement Age. The SRS ends at age 62.
