Typically when we speak about smaller than normal red blood cells, we talk about their volume. Assuming you mean small volume red blood cells (called a low MCV), there are many conditions that can cause this. I recommend that you follow-up with your doctor. The most common is iron deficiency, which is diagnosed not only by looking at blood iron levels but also ferritin, total iron binding capacity and sometimes transferrin saturation.
