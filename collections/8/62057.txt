Muscle atrophy, often seen in people in wheelchairs, can lead to leg weakness. The power and ability to move one's legs stems from the interaction of two processes. These are the nerve signal that is sent to the muscles from the brain and passes via the spinal cord, and the muscle's intrinsic power to contract. Any interruption in this pathway in the lower limb can result in leg weakness. As such, leg weakness can be caused by a muscle disease or a nerve disease.
