This globby mess blocks the skin's pores and bacteria develops, causing a pimple, and then more pimples. The good news is you are in good company: almost everyone suffers from pimples at some point in their lives (I read something about 85%, but how they got that figure is beyond me). Even adults suffer from acne: one in 5 women between the ages of 25 and 40 have adult acne. Adult acne affects more women than men. Another bit of good news: those pimples will disappear post-menopause when your skin loses all those hormones that caused them to flare up in the first place.
