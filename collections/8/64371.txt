Let`s do the math. If Canada typically accepts 300,000 new immigrants every year, and the portion of refugees cannot exceed 20-30% of that, just not to break the long-term immigration policy. That means Canada could receive 60,000-90,000 refugees.This is less than 1% annually of all refugees anticipated to leave Syria.f Canada typically accepts 300,000 new immigrants every year, and the portion of refugees cannot exceed 20-30% of that, just not to break the long-term immigration policy.
