How Does an Employee Furlough Work vs. a Layoff? In mandatory employee furloughs, employees take unpaid or partially paid time off of work for periods of time. The employees generally have either scheduled time off or call back rights and expectations. In a layoff, employees generally have no rights of recall and no expectation of the job returning.
