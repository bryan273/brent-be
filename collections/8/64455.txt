Large sunspots, visible to the naked eye, were noted by the ancient Chinese. The first specific mention of sunspots in modern scientific literature was by Italian astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei (1564 â€“ 1642) in his Starry Messenger published in 1610. Sunspot occurrence has been carefully noted by astronomers ever since. Astronomers have found that the frequency of sunspots varies with a period of between 11 and 13 years. This corresponds to the period of solar activity cycle involving solar flares, prominences and other phenomena associated with the outer layers of the Sun.
