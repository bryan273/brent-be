Arnold brand bread is a mixed bag. Their regular white and whole wheat pullman loaves are vegan, but most of their Country, Health-full, or Grains & More line are not, as they contain milk products. Their hamburger buns are vegan, which is good news, as they placed second in our hamburger bun tasting.
