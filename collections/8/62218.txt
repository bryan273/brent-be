Do I need a doctor's certificate? Employers who are only paying Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) cannot ask for a doctor's certificate for the first seven days of a spell of sickness.The seven days include non-working days, such as weekends. Employers are entitled to ask for evidence that you have been off sick. Typically, employers make rules such as: asking for a medical statement (now known as a Statement of Fitness for Work or ‘fit note’, rather than a 'sick note') after seven days' absence. 2  In 2012, GPs started issuing electronic Fit Notes. 3  These are typed by the GP and then handed to the patient. 4  They are not sent by the GP to the employer.
