Causes of Sneezing. If your cat is sneezing a lot, your veterinarian may initially suspect a cause based on a review of your catâ€™s symptoms. One of the main causes of sneezing is infection. In some cases, the vet may take a swab from the mouth, throat, eyes, or nose and send it to a lab to confirm an infection.
