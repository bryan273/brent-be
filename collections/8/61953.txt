Introduction. The 16th-century Spanish explorer and conquistador Hernando de Soto (c. 1496-1542) arrived in the West Indies as a young man and went on to make a fortune in the Central American slave trade. He supplied ships for Francisco Pizarroâ€™s southward expedition and ended up accompanying Pizarro in his conquest of Peru in 1532.
