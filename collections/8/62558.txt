Calcium chloride melts ice faster than other deicers. Forms ice-melting brine faster â€“ the faster an ice melter can dissolve and form a brine solution, the faster it will melt ice. On contact with ice, calcium chloride forms brine rapidly, which lowers the freezing point of water and melts snow and ice quickly.
