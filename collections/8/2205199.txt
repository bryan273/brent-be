A woefully inaccurate list that fails to mention its based on only US shows. The UK has some of the longest running TV shows in the world including The Sky At Night (55 years), Coronation Street (52 years. Considering Guiding Light was cancelled in 2009 its days are numbered as the longest running TV show of all time. In fact The Sky At Night is currently the longest running TV show on air and will beat Guiding Light as the longest of all time in 2 years. All UK shows are garbage and not worth even mentioning.
