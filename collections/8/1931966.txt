Hospital midwife. It is possible to get the feeling that you're pregnant soon after you've conceived. So you may experience very early pregnancy symptoms at three weeks. One of the earliest symptoms you may feel is a prickling, tingling sensation in your nipples, which can sometimes feel very sore. This happens as pregnancy hormones increase the blood supply to your breasts.
