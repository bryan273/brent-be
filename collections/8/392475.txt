The types of varicose vein surgery include: 1  Ambulatory phlebectomy (also called micro-incision phlebectomy, hook phlebectomy, stab avulsion phlebectomy, and microphlebectomy) removes portions of varicose veins through small incisions using a hook. 2  Ligation and stripping usually removes the saphenous vein, a large vein in the leg.
