6. Get a friend to help you. Having ideas (especially ones they have been entertaining awhile), a plan, and the means to commit suicide constitute a very serious, immediate danger, and you should contact police immediately. If you're on the phone, it's best not to let this person know that's what you're doing though. If your friend tells you that she/he is going to commit suicide, get help immediately, even if they tell you to keep it secret. 2  It is better to anger a friend than lose the actual human being.
