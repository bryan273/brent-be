Cipro for urinary tract infections. If your doctor prescribes Cipro for your UTI, you’ll likely take the drug at home. You’ll take it by mouth as either a tablet or liquid suspension. Typically, treatment lasts 3 to 14 days. As with all antibiotics, you should take Cipro exactly as prescribed by your doctor.
