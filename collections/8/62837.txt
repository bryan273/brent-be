The world's tallest trees are California redwoods, technically known as Sequoia sempervirens. Until recently, some tree experts had theorized that the redwoods' couldn't exceed 120 meters (394 feet). But the theory clashed with historical legends of taller trees. There have been accounts of a Douglas fir tree that was measured early in last century and was 125 meters (410 feet) tall.
