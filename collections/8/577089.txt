If your blood pressure is borderline unhealthy, eating a cup of blueberries a day could help lower it. In a 2015 study of women ages 45 to 65 with the early stages of high blood pressure, half ate 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry powder (the equivalent of a cup of fresh berries) daily for eight weeks, while the other half ate an identical-looking powder that didnâ€™t contain any blueberries.
