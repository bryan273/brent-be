Cook. Useful when a vanilla flavor is desired but liquid flavoring can not be used or is not desireable. The powder is off-white and has the consistency of confectioner's sugar, with small brown-black flecks of vanilla. Great for sprinkling on desserts, drinks, and much more or for making pre-mixed baking mixes for cookies, cakes, and so forth.
