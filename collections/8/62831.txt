No. Page Emissions from Volvo’s trucks 01 2064010005 3 (5) Example: A truck and trailer are fully loaded with a total weight of 40 tons of which the payload is 26 tons. For a certain type of transport on the motorway (freeway), the fuel consumption is 0.275 litres per km.Of course the consumption can be lower for other types of transport and when the truck is not fully loaded. The 2009 truck has an engine that complies with Euro 5.The emissions per ton-km can be calculated as follows: Nitrogen oxides, NOx 0.275 l/km * 7 g/l per 26 tons ≈ 0,074 g/ton-km Particulates, PM 0.275 l/km * 0,1 g/l per 26 tons ≈ 0,0011 g/ton-km The emissions of carbon dioxide depend on the fuel consumption.he 2009 truck has an engine that complies with Euro 5.
