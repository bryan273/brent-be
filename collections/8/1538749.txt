Chickenpox and Shingles Blisters. Chickenpox and shingles are both skin conditions caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Chickenpox, a common childhood disease, causes the formation of hundreds of liquid-filled blisters. These extremely itchy blisters generally turn cloudy within two days, after which they pop open and turn crusty.
