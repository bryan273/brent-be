The Maillard Reaction. The reaction between reducing sugars and amine groups of amino acids and proteins is called the Maillard reaction, after the French chemist who discovered it in 1912. It has since become recognized as an important factor in determining the color, aroma, and nutritional value of many foodstuffs.
