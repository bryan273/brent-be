When applied to the surface of the skin or as a hair dye, henna is generally safe for use during pregnancy. Select your dye carefully, and make sure that the dye you are using is 100% natural henna. Natural henna stains the skin orange, red, brown, cinnamon, brick, chocolate, or coffee, and can last about one to four weeks.
