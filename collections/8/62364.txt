A laboratory test to rule in or rule out atopy in patients with allergy-like symptoms. ImmunoCAP provides a clinically relevant means of confirming or excluding the presence of atopic disease in patients with upper respiratory disease. These allergy-like symptoms are very difficult to differentiate. ImmunoCAP will also accurately identify specific allergen sensitivities in patients with confirmed allergy.
