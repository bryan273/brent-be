Determine the last expected spring frost date for your area. Plan to plant your russet potatoes about 21 days before that date. Cultivate your planting area to break up any hard soil, keeping your rows about 3 feet apart. This potato variety prefers well-draining, loose soils with plenty of organic matter.
