The sense perhaps evolved via track made by a vessel through ice. Perhaps the English word is directly from Scandinavian. Figurative phrase in the wake of following close behind is recorded from 1806. n.2 state of wakefulness, Old English -wacu (as in nihtwacu night watch), related to watch; and partly from Old Norse vaka vigil, eve before a feast, related to vaka be awake (cf. Old High German wahta watch, vigil, Middle Dutch wachten to watch, guard; see wake (v.)).
