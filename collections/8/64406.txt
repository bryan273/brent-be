Welcome to the Indiana State Fair! We live in a Wonderful World of Food. We grow it. We sell it. We cook it. We eat it. And at the 2017 Fair, we will have FUN celebrating it! Join us in telling the story of how Indiana is helping feed the world. The Indiana State Fair returns to honor Youth, Agriculture and Education in an entertaining and fun environment. Join us to make more memories next year August 4-20, 2017!
