Some chains, like Hyatt, will not charge a resort fee for rooms booked exclusively with points. For example, the Grand Hyatt Kauai charges a resort fee of $25 plus tax, but Emily and I didnâ€™t pay it for the nights we used points to stay there. Cash and points bookings do have a resort fee added, though.
