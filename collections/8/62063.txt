3 years agoSlowmo. Hi, my legs too have become very weak, especially when walking upstairs etc, they feel so heavy, I need to hold onto handrails etc as they can easily give way. They hurt as if I've done an extreme session at the gym(chance would be a fine thing!). Sorry I dont know what it is but you're not alone.
