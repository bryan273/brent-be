The tourniquet test is an important basic screening test for dengue. The WHO also suggests using the tourniquet test as a vital parameter in the diagnosis of dengue. Cao et al. mentioned that the tourniquet test was a helpful indication of dengue infection in diagnosis in highly rural areas in endemic countries. The main reason for this practice is the limited resources and the fact that there is little change in therapeutic management after receiving a definite diagnosis method.
