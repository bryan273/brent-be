To minimize dry mouth: 1  Drink water frequently to keep your mouth moist and loosen mucus. 2  Suck on sugar-free hard candies, ice chips, or sugar-free popsicles. 3  Moisten foods with broths, soups, sauces, gravy, creams, and butter or margarine.  Avoid commercial mouth rinses or mouthwashes that contain alcohol or peroxide.
