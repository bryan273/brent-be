Gently press a warm tea bag on the blister for about 30 minutes. Repeat it several times a day. You can make a facial mask of egg and yogurt and apply it on the blisters. You just need to mix 1 egg with one cup of yogurt and a bit of manuka honey. Egg and yogurt will help soothe the fever blister to a great extent.
