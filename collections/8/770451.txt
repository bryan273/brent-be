However, certain subtle processes like weathering change the earth's surface slowly. ➺ Destructive forces mainly lead to erosion and weathering of rocks. ➺ In erosion, soil particles are stripped away by water, wind, ice, and gravity over time. Erosion implies movement of sediment from one place to another. The boring, scraping, burrowing, and grinding of organisms results in the erosion of hard ocean as well as terrestrial substrates.
