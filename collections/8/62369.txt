Selective attention is the ability to focus on relevant stimuli and ignore competing stimuli. This skill is associated with distractibility. There are a variety of CPTs, the more commonly used being the Integrated Visual and Auditory CPT (IVA-2), Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A.) and the Conners' CPT-II.
