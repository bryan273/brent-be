Purine compounds, whether produced in the body or from eating high-purine foods, can raise uric acid levels. Excess uric acid can produce uric acid crystals, which then build up in soft tissues and joints, causing the painful symptoms of gout.igh-Purine Foods Include: 1  Alcoholic beverages (all types). 2  Some fish, seafood and shellfish, including anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, codfish, scallops, trout and haddock. 3  Some meats, such as bacon, turkey, veal, venison and organ meats like liver.
