Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition caused by a faulty gene (known as the CFTR gene). The CFTR gene normally creates a protein that moves salt and water out of a cell.If the CFTR gene is defective, it results in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways.These blockages damage the lungs, digestive system and other organs, resulting in inflammation (swelling) and, in the lungs, repeated infections.f the CFTR gene is defective, it results in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways.
