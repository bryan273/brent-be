Owens Corningâ„¢ Roofing is here to help. Our entire Roofing Basics section is designed to give you the information you need. While replacing a roof can be a big, important decision, it also helps protect your biggest investment-your home-and it gives you the chance to start fresh with a new exterior look. Getting the color and shape of shingle you always wanted is a great way to express your individual personality and add real value. Plus, if you have a leak, ignoring it can only get worse and could result in interior damage or even mold or roof deck rot.
