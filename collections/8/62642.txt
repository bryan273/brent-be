Magnesium and Kidney Stones. Magnesium breaks down calcium kidney stones. Early yesterday morning, I was awaken by a dream I was having that showed me I was about to have another kidney stone attack. The dream was quite ugly and since each time I had kidney stone attacks in the past, the attacks were always preceded by a dream pertaining to my health.
