Anosmia caused by a treatable condition, such as nasal polyps or sinusitis, can be reversed. The treatment goal is to remove the obstruction or the cause of nasal swelling. If anosmia is caused by a drug, the medication can be discontinued. Once corrective measures are taken, the sense of smell may be restored.
