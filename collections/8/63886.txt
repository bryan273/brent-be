Each new DNA contains one strand that was originally part of the parent strand, and one newly-synthesized daughter strand. This is called semiconservative replication. (Each DNA is half old and half new.) Transcription â€“ Synthesis of RNA from a DNA template Occurs in a region of the nucleus called the nucleolus.RNA polymerase enzyme synthesizes a strand of RNA complementary to a section of one of the DNA strands (the template strand).1. Initiation: A section of DNA known as the promoter (TATA box for eukaryotes) signals where the transcription begins. RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to this site.NA polymerase enzyme synthesizes a strand of RNA complementary to a section of one of the DNA strands (the template strand). 1.
