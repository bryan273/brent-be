Canada provides immigrants with language training and access to Canada's national health care and social welfare programs. The Canadian government has many more programs to welcome immigrants and help them settle than the United States, says Deborah Meyers of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based group.anada has granted permanent resident status to more than 200,000 immigrants and refugees in each of the last ten years and aims to maintain similar if not higher levels for 2006. The majority come from Asia, particularly China, India, and the Philippines.
