Question: How long does it take for HIV to progress to AIDS? Answer: In all but a few rare cases, if left untreated, HIV will progress to a stage of infection we call AIDS. This is when the immune defenses have been compromised, and the body is less able to defend itself against potentially life-threatening infections.
