These implants are either a metal pin or a U-shaped frame that passes through the jawbone and the gum tissue, into the mouth. The dental specialist or general dentist chooses the type, size, and design of dental implant. This choice is made according to where the implant will be placed, what kind of bone and how much bone is available, and the design of the tooth or teeth that will be supported by the implant(s).
