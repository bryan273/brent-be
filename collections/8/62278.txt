Question 1: This tree is already almost 6 feet tall and 1.5 in diameter at the trunk. According to the local nursery (which I have a very good relationship with), they don√Çt know if it is dwarf, semi dwarf etc. But, the owner did say that this grower was did the absolutely best grafts out of all her growers.
