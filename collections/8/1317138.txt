Many people suffer from discomfort caused by swollen hands, but reasons for the problem may vary. Sometimes an injury is to blame for the swelling, but medical problems can be the culprit as well. Another common cause is edema, a type of swelling that results when small blood vessels leak fluid into the surrounding tissue. Arthritis is a very common reason for swollen hands.
