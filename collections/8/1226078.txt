Mass is a measure of the number of atoms in an object combined with the density of those atoms. Usually people measure mass in kilograms. You can tell how much mass something has by measuring how hard it is to get that thing to change directions or slow down. If you're driving a big truck, for instance, you're going to need a lot stronger brakes to stop the truck than if you were riding a bicycle.
