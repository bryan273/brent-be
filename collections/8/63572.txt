However, if you desire to do so (for instance, because you want to grow exceptionally large, vibrant blooms), take care so as not to over-fertilize, as peace lilies can be somewhat sensitive plants. Use a standard 20-20-20 house plant fertilizer at one half or one quarter its recommended strength about once per month in the spring and summer, when the plant's growth is most active.
