ALT is normally found inside liver cells. However, when the liver is damaged or inflamed, ALT can be released into your bloodstream. This causes serum ALT levels to rise. Measuring the level of ALT in the blood can help doctors evaluate liver function or determine the underlying cause of a liver problem. The ALT test is often part of an initial screening for liver disease. An ALT test is also known as a serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) test or an alanine transaminase test.
