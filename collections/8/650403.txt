Some degree of tremor is normal in everyone. Sometimes something can go wrong with parts of the brain involved with movement, such as the basal ganglia or the cerebellum. Tremor can be caused by diseases like multiple sclerosis, stroke, and neurodegenerative problems like Parkinsonâ€™s disease . It can also be caused by drugs like alcohol, amphetamine, and steroids. Problems that affect the entire body, such as thyroid disease or liver failure, can cause tremor as well.
