Oral steroids are the most effective medical treatment for nasal polyposis. In adults, most authors use prednisone (30-60 mg) for 4-7 days and taper the medicine for 1-3 weeks. Dosage varies for children, but the maximum dosage is usually 1 mg/kg/day for 5-7 days, which is then tapered over 1-3 weeks.
