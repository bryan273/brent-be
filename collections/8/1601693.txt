Definition of Primary Succession. Primary succession is the colonization of new sites by communities of organisms. It often occurs after a devastating event has wiped out the organisms that lived in the area, or with the creation of a new habitat. Let's look at a couple examples to see how primary succession occurs.he organisms that engage in primary succession are known as pioneer species. Typical pioneer species include simple lichens, algae, and fungi. These simple organisms begin breaking down the resources in the environment and make it suitable for the later introduction of more complex species, such as vascular plants.
