A strong electrolyte is a solute that completely, or almost completely, ionizes or dissociates in a solution. These ions are good conductors of electric current in the solution. Originally, a strong electrolyte was defined as a chemical that, when in aqueous solution, is a good conductor of electricity. With greater understanding of the properties of ions in solution its definition was replaced by the present one.
