[edit on Wikidata] Lactic acidosis is a medical condition characterized by the buildup of lactate (especially L-lactate) in the body, with as a result an excessively low pH. It is a subtype of metabolic acidosis, where there is excessive acid due to a problem with the body's metabolism. Lactic acidosis is typically the result of an underlying acute or chronic medical condition, medication or poisoning. The symptoms are generally attributable to these underlying causes, but may include nausea, vomiting, rapid deep breathing and generalised weakness.
