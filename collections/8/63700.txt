There is an oft-repeated story that they used to fly different coloured flags at the Globe theatre (and, one presumes, at the other playhouses) to let potential audience members know what type of play was being shown.he story about coloured flags at the Globe theatre is as follows:  White meant that a comedy was playing that night. (Or rather, that  day. In Elizabethan times, public per â€¦ formances were not held at  night. They started at around 2:00 in the afternoon.) Red meant a  historic play was on, like Henry V.
