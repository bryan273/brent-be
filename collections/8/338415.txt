I've had this too. I don't know if it's normal though. But it's only after I drink alot of water and then jump up & down/try to workout. That's when I hear what sounds like the water I just drank swishing around in my bowels. Like as if my tummy was a drink container and it sounds like the liquid shaken up. I take Miralax in 16 oz of water so after that is when I hear is and i'm moving around.
