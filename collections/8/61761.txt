Cultural Universal. Cultural universals are specific behavioral elements that are common to every culture. Anthropologist George Murdock compiled a list of cultural universals, including sports, cooking, courtship, dancing, family, games, music, religion, and marriage. Although Murdokâ€™s universals are found in every culture, the way in which they are expressed varies from culture to culture. Funeral rites are practiced in every culture in some form.
