There are also winds that blow from the north, southwards and also those from the south blowing northwards. Anemometers. Anemometers measure the direction of winds. They come in different models but use a similar principle â€” cups on a bar! It simply works like this: the faster the wind, the faster the cups rotate. The speed of the rotating cups is measured by a speedometer. Another instrument in wind measurement is the wind vane. It involves a pointer mounted on a vertical shaft. When the wind blows, the arm sways until the pointer faces the direction of the wind. These days, there are some really cool technology that meteorologists use to measure air pressure, speeds and direction.
