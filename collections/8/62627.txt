For example, a red scar may simply require one pulsed dye laser treatment, but treatment of a raised and dark scar may mean doing steroid injections, followed by fractional laser resurfacing followed by q-switched laser. The treatment given in the former example will cost less than the one given in the latter. The most important factor to consider with cost is what your goals for treatment are. Maybe the texture of your scar doesnâ€™t bug you at all, but the color drives you crazy.
