September 22, 2006. How high should it be cut? Well, first it depends on what type of grass you have (see: Getting to Know Your Lawn) in order to help determine the suggested mowing height). From the table, you should be able to determine what type of grass you have and the recommended mowing height for each. For example, if you identified your lawn as Common Bermuda grass, then your suggested mowing height should range from 3/4 to 1 1/2 inches. As a rule of thumb, it is best tostay at the high end of these suggested heights, especially during seasonal droughts and heat waves.
