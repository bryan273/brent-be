This is so sad, immigration used to be a great thing for our country but now were accepting too many immigrants and they don't want to change their lifestyles to blend with Canadian society.hen we add in the rest of the Asian nations approximately half of all immigrants to Canada, if not more, come from one region of the world. Simply stated Canada is importing too many Asian immigrants.
