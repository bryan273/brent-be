Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones of the body become brittle making them easier to fracture (a fracture means the same thing as a break).The hips, spine and wrist are usually the first to break. Osteoporosis gradually weakens the bones so that they become susceptible to the slightest trauma.cientists are still not 100 percent sure of the causes of osteoporosis. Bone mass decreases in women naturally between 1 to 5 percent every year after the age of 40. This rate is only about 1 percent in men.
