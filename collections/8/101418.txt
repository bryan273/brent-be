Depending on the type of bread: rye, wholemeal or white, one average 32 gram slice packs between 70 to 80 calories. Regular butter is 7 calories per gram so the total can be anywhere between 90-100 calories for a very lightly buttered whole wheat slice and 200 calories for a thickly buttered, white bread toast.
