1 Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning.  Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome.
