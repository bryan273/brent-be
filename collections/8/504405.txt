When diarrhea is already a problem, you should eliminate high-fiber foods from your diet for a few weeks and see if that helps. Fruits to skip include pears, apples, most berries, figs, prunes, dates, and raisins. High-fiber vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, artichokes, and peas.
