When GDP is bound, as shown here, the G protein is inactive. To activate the protein, the GDP is replaced with GTP, the G protein will deliver its signal, as shown on the next page. G proteins come in many shapes and sizes. Most are used for cell signaling, but other types play an important role in other tasks, such as powering protein synthesis.
