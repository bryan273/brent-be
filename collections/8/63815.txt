example 2 find the average rate of change of from 3 to 0 since the average rate of change of a function is the slope of the associated line we have already done the work in the last problem that is the average rate of change of from 3 to 0 is 1 that is over the interval 0 3 for every 1 unit change in x there is a 1 unit change in the value of the function here is a graph of the function the two points used and the line connecting those two points
