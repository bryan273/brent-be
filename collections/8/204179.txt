A stomach ulcer (also called a peptic ulcer or a gastric ulcer) is a small erosion (hole) in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common type of stomach ulcer is a duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcers occur in the first 12 inches of small intestine beyond the stomach. Ulcers that form in the stomach are called gastric ulcers.
