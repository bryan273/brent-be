Cold compresses help reduce puffiness. The coolness helps increase circulation in the area making eye bags less noticeable. Use a wet washcloth moistened with cool water and hold it to the under eye area using slight pressure. Another option is to keep a spoon in the freezer and use it on the area when bags appear.
