Be aware that even some hotels that are affiliated with rewards program like Westin Las Vegas (SPG) and the Venetian (Priority Club) still come with mandatory resort fees in the range of $20 â€“ $25 per day. Though if you have elite status in one of those programs it never hurts to try and have the resort fee waived.
