Don’t pick at your nose ring or touch it excessively. Contact with your hands increases the chances that your nose piercing will become infected, so wash your hands before touching the stud or ring. Take care not to get any makeup, lotion, or facial care products in your piercing while it’s healing. If you do, wash the nose ring gently with salt water. If you have a stud, rotate it one full turn each night before you go to bed. Do this for the first month after you get your piercing.
