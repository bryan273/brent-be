You can eat and drink what you like while youâ€™re breastfeeding, in moderation. But try to have a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fluids such as water, milk or unsweetened fruit juices. You should also take a supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day. Breastfeeding may make you hungry, so have plenty of healthy snacks to hand. See our healthy 200-calorie snacks slideshow for ideas. The foods you eat can sometimes flavour your breastmilk. This may actually help your baby to be more accepting of new tastes when she starts to eat solid foods. You're probably now enjoying foods that were off-limits in pregnancy, such as of soft cheeses and pates.
