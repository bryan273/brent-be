According to Ethnologue, Esperanto is spoken by some 2 million people as a second language in 115 countries, most of them in Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, and South America. There are over 25,000 original and translated books in Esperanto and over a hundred Esperanto magazines. Many Esperanto speakers use the language for travel throughout the world using the Pasporta Servo, a hospitality service for speakers of Esperanto. Others have pen pals in many countries around the world using services such as Esperanto Mondo.
