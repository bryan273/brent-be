A few weeks ago I wrote a post that mandatory resort fees were coming to the Caesar’s family of hotels in Vegas as of 3/1/13. This includes hotels like Harrah’s, Planet Hollywood, Paris, and Caesar’s that previously proudly proclaimed themselves to be “Resort Fee Free”. That meant that the vast majority of hotels on the strip now have mandatory resort fees that are often in the range of $15 – $25 per night.
