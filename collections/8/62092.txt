The patient was a young black man named James Cornish. He had been rushed to Provident Hospital on the South Side with a knife wound in his chest from a barroom brawl. Dr. Daniel Hale Williams--a founder of Provident, which had opened two years previously as the city's first interracial hospital--knew Cornish was bleeding to death.
