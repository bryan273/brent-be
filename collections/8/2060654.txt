Trigger Finger. A painful condition that causes catching or locking of a finger as it is extended. Trigger finger is due to overgrowth of tissue in the tendon sheath (the protective membrane) of the flexor muscles, the muscles that ordinarily allow fingers to curl. Also called flexor tenosynovitis, trigger finger is a fairly common complication of diabetes, especially long-standing diabetes.
