Malts at DQ are made with ice milk not ice cream. Malt is malted milk and is a powder that is used by all the malt makers across America. Shakes only contain the flavor that one picks plus the ice cream and milk. Both are blended until it is a nice consistency. Source(s): Have enjoyed many malts and shakes!
