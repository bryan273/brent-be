4. Coconut Oil. Coconut oil is excellent for the hair and scalp and has been used for years in tropical countries as a well-loved beauty tonic. To use coconut oil for itchy scalp, warm a bit of coconut oil and massage it into the scalp. Leave it for a bit and then rinse off. It will take away dry scalp and will add shine and luster to your locks.
