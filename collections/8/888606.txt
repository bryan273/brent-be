Internal Hemorrhoids: First- to Fourth-Degree. A first-degree internal hemorrhoid bulges into the anal canal during bowel movements. A second-degree internal hemorrhoid bulges from the anus during bowel movements, then goes back inside by itself. A third-degreehemorrhoid bulges from the anus during bowel movements and must be pushed back in with a finger. A fourth-degree hemorrhoid protrudes from the anus all the time.
