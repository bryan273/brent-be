The disease is transferred from person to person by bacteria-contaminated droplets formed during a coughing spell; however, the disease may be prevented by vaccinations. Symptoms of whooping cough vary. Early in the infection, the symptoms resemble those of a cold; mild fever, nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal discharge, and a dry cough. However, in contrast to a cold, the symptoms persist and worsen over about one to two weeks.
