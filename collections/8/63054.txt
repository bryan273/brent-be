While much media attention was invariably focused on which Hollywood movie was filming here, it was TV production that helped the industry through the toughest times. In 2011, domestic TV production was almost four times movie production: $626 million to $165 million. That includes series such as Flashpoint, Degrassi: The Next Generation and The Listener. Moreover, Flashpoint was one of the reasons why measly Canadian TV budgets became supercharged. At about $2 million per episode, it was double the budget of many Canadian series, although still below the $3 million for a comparable American show.
