Doctors call that bump hallux valgus, but you might know it as a bunion. Bunions form when the bone or tissue at the joint at the bottom of the big toe moves out of place. Years of abnormal motion and pressure on the joint forces the big toe to bend toward the others, which causes an often-painful lump on the joint. This joint at the base of the big toe carries much of your weight while walking, so bunions can cause severe and constant pain.
