1 You would use a 79mm cigarette roller with these size rolling papers.  1 1/2: 1 1/2 got it's name because it can hold approximately 50% more product than a Single Wide rolling paper. The 1 1/2 rolling paper is 76-78mm in length and 60-62mm in width. This works out to be about 3.1 x 2.4 inches. This is the same as a 1 1/4 rolling paper except that it will roll a bigger diameter cigarette because of it's bigger width.
