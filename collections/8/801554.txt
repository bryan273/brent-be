Endocrine imbalances may cause soft erections. Testosterone plays a major role in healthy erectile function and normal levels are essential for proper function. Erectile dysfunction can be a sign of elevated prolactin or thyroid hormone levels. Diminished thyroid hormone amounts also can cause weak erections. Diabetes is well known to cause erectile dysfunction. In fact, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse notes that 35 to 50 percent of men with diabetes have accompanying ED.
