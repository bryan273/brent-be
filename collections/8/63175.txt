Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman was one of the few highlights of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and now her standalone movie will be coming out sooner than originally anticipated. Variety reports that Warner Bros. has moved up the release date of Wonder Woman to June 2nd, 2017, three weeks earlier than its original release date. Along with Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. is pushing Jungle Book: Origins back more than a year to October 19th, 2018.
