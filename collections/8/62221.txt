Best Answer: Hi Lauren, while there is certainly no LAW that specifies whether you need a medical certificate for taking one day off work, it would generally be included in your award or workplace agreement.complete change of tone on my bosses part) well, everybody's sick lauren (this was done in a mocking way, like i was faking it to get out of work) *i stay silent* fine, but you will need to provide a doctors certificate. This seems a little off to me. I'm missing 5 hours of work. I'm only 15.
