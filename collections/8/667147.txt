Plantar Fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is considered the most common cause of foot pain. The plantar fascia, the ligament that runs along the sole of the foot, becomes inflamed, causing pain. Sportsmen and women, those who have to stand for long hours and those who are overweight are especially prone to plantar fasciitis.
