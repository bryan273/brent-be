Many conditions can cause leg pain and weakness. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, leg pain can be caused by overuse injuries, inflammatory diseases, lower extremity trauma and certain medical conditions. In some cases, leg pain is accompanied by lower extremity weakness. Simultaneous leg pain and weakness may signal a serious underlying condition, especially if the weakness develops rapidly. A person may first notice leg weakness when climbing stairs or performing other activities of daily living.
