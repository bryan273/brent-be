Many people who have frequent or severe migraines may use preventive medications, including beta-blockers such as propranolol. Beta-blockers, which slow the heart rate, are used mostly to treat heart conditions. “These medications aren’t for migraine patients who have asthma, certain lung problems or slow heart rate,” Bastings warns. Certain antiepileptic drugs, such as topiramate and divalproex sodium, are also prescribed for migraines.
