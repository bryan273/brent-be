A PCL tear resulting in back of the knee pain can be caused by a fall on the knees when they are bent, a blow to the front of the knee or a major twisting motion, such as during a skiing wipeout. Physical therapy and surgery are the usual PCL tear treatment methods, likely with use of a ligament tear knee brace.
