Salmonella is mostly found in chicken eggs, unclean chicken, unpastuerized milk, tomatoes, peanut butter, ground meat and fish. Any food can be contaminated with Salmonella, which causes food poisoning. Food poisonings' symptoms include diarhea, vomitting, chills, painful headaches, and most commonly, a fever.
