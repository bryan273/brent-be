Unfortunately, this condition can take a while to treat because the fat pad is aggravated every time you move your knee. The first step is to rest and apply ice to the area to reduce inflammation. Exercises to strength the muscles that support your knee can also help. Taping your knee cap is another effective treatment method. This gives the fat pad more room to move underneath, so that it is no longer trapped in the joint.
