The term jock itch typically describes an itchy rash in a man's groin. Although there are many causes of jock itch, this term has become synonymous with tinea cruris, a common fungal infection that affects the groin and inner thighs of men and woman. Tinea is the name of the fungus; cruris comes from the Latin word for leg. Jock itch can develop when tight garments trap moisture and heat.
