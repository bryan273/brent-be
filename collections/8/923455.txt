Losing your beloved pet is one of lifeâ€™s difficulties. Domesticated pets are part of the family, and most pet lovers are in distress when their pet displays signs that something is wrong. You should recognize telltale signs of a dying pet to make the process easier for him. Dogs and cats often do not move as well when they get older. Your dog might not be able to jump into the car or go upstairs anymore; your cat may become less able to climb onto and jump from her favorite perches.
