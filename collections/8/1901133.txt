Heat: Extremely high temperatures in the battery as a result of charging or rapid discharging from using the device, could have an effect on the chemistry of the battery. This negative chemical effect could cause your battery to get swollen. Faulty Manufacturing: This is a case of the manufacturer’s issue. It’s not your fault; it’s a problem which occurred within the manufacturing process, that’s why your poorly-made battery has swollen.
