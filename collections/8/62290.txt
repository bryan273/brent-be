The Computer Museum in Boston asked that question in 1986, and held a contest to find the answer. Judges settled on John Blankenbakerâ€™s Kenbak-1 as the first personal computer. Designed in 1971, before microprocessors were invented, the Kenbak-1 had 256 bytes of memory and featured small and medium scale integrated circuits on a single circuit board. The title of first personal computer using a microprocessor went to the 1973 Micral.
