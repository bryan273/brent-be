1 Electron CaptureIt is possible for a proton in the nucleus to “capture” an electron and turn into a neutron releasing a neutrino e p e n e. 2  9. 3  Feynman’s Diagram for e-captureThe force responsible for electron capture is the weak force.4  So, the exchange particle is the W+. 10. 2  Electron – Proton CollisionWhen an electron and a proton collide the proton turns into a neutron releasing a neutrino e p e n e. 3  11. 4  Feynman’s Diagram for e- - p collisionsThe force responsible for this collision is the weak force.
