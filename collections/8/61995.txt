BBQ propane tank sizes usually refer to the 20 gallon tank. This is the one that is most often used on grills. They are 12 inches in diameter and 18 inches high. As this name suggests, these tanks are for portable grills. These tanks are smaller than the standard at only 10 gallons. They are designed for tailgating or camping. A ten gallon tank weighs 11 lbs and is 15 inches high. Like other propane tanks, these are available in sporting goods stores.
