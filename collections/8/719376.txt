Palpitation Causes. The heart needs its normal environment to work well. This is especially true for the heart's electrical system; changes in electrical conduction may lead to a decreased ability for the heart to pump blood. From within the body, abnormal levels of electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, and calcium can cause palpitations.
