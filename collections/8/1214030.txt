Heart flutters, also known as heart palpitations, feel like a fluttering in the chest or an unusually fast heart rate. Often they can be attributed to stress, exercise or unusual activities. Although heart flutters may be of concern and feel like they are extremely serious, they usually are a minor health event. Individuals who feel heart flutters may have an underlying minor health issue, such as a mitral valve prolapse or a heart murmur that is active at the moment of the palpitation. According to both the Mayo Clinic and Dr. David Dugdale, III, of MedlinePlus, strenuous exercise can trigger heart flutter episodes.
