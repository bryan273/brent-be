I don't feel anything weird about me except the nose bleed that is annoying and the bleeding is only from my left nose. My nodule is on my left also. I read somewhere that one lady had nose bleed when her left shoulder muscle plus other factors caused her left nose to bleed very often. There is nothing wrong with my shoulder. The only thing I see that may have blocked the flow of blood is my nodule.
