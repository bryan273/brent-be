Each play-house advanceth his flagge in the aire, whither quickly at the waving thereof are summoned whole troops of men, women, and children. Flags were used by the Globe Theater to announce and proclaim the performance of a play.The modern equivalent is the theater marquee.oday theater marquees remain the same for as long as a particular play is performed. In the time of Shakespeare, plays changed or were postponed daily, and so the theater-going populace needed to be kept current about the latest showings. Think of the flags as the first theater advertisements.
