Compost is the tertiary ingredient in infusing Compost Mound pouches. It is also an ingredient in Mud Pies. Up to 255 compost may be stored in a tool leprechaun. To apply compost, use it on an empty and weeded farming patch before planting a seed or sapling. It can be used on all farming patches except the evil turnip patch. It can also be used before treating a patch with supercompost.
