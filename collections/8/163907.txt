The swelling is caused by too much fluid in the tissue, which is called edema.. Swollen feet, legs and ankles are a very common problem that usually doesn't require treatment. For example, gravity often pulls fluid down into the feet when you've been walking all day. This swelling usually goes away by the next day.
