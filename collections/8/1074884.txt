Introduction. Sinus headaches cause a dull, deep, throbbing pain in the front of your head and face. They are caused by an inflammation in your sinuses, air-filled cavities around your nose, eyes, and cheeks. Bending down or leaning over usually makes the pain worse, as does cold and damp weather. Sinus headaches often begin first thing in the morning, and may be better by afternoon.
