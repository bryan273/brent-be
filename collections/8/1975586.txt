Digestive Symptoms. Often hernia patients are first aware of their condition because of a feeling of heaviness that doesn't go away. In many cases, this feeling is accompanied by constipation or blood in the stool. Digestive symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may indicate the presence of a bowel obstruction or strangulation caused by a hernia.
