This page, SCFM2, continues our discussion about SCFM and how it affects compressed air measure and flow. Page one on SCFM is right here. As a home user of an air compressor and air tools, or if you are an industrial user of compressed air, why do you want to know the definition of SCFM? Why not just ignore SCFM? What you do need to know how much flow and pressure a specific compressor will generate for you. You will have to know how much air and at what air pressure a specific air tool or compressed air using application will need.
