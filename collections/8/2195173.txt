You should avoid eating swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tilefish. Predator fishes contain high amounts of mercury, so you should avoid these fish. Instead, consider eating fish like salmon, catfish, pollock, shrimp and canned light tuna. You can include about two meals of the fish in your diet every week.
