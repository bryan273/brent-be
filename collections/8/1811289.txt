Many women experience acne during pregnancy. Itâ€™s most common during the first and second trimesters. An increase in hormones called androgens can cause the glands in your skin to grow and produce more sebum, an oily, waxy substance. This oil can clog pores and lead to bacteria, inflammation, and breakouts. Women who are prone to breakouts during their menstrual periods have a greater likelihood of pregnancy acne, according to March of Dimes. Fortunately, pregnancy and postpartum acne is usually temporary. It will likely clear up once your hormones return to normal.
