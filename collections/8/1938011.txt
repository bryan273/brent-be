Gently wash and dry the areas of ringworm on your child's body. Take care with the areas between the toes and skin folds, and wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Wash your hands after applying antifungal cream or shampoo to your child's skin. Keep your child's towels, sheets, clothes, hairbrush, and toys separate. Wash them frequently to remove ringworm fungus. Dress your child in loose-fitting cotton clothes that cover her arms and legs.
