The ability of your skin to stretch and then return to its normal state afterward is called elasticity. Unfortunately, a loss of elasticity in the skin is a natural part of aging known as elastosis.et go of that skin and examine it to see how quickly it returns to a normal position. In younger people the elasticity of skin is better which is related to the thickness of the dermis. In older people elasticity is poorer because there is less dermis to cause the skin to snap back to its original position.
