Thyroid gland. The thyroid gland covers the windpipe from three sides. Two hormones of the thyroid gland, T3 (thyroxine) and T4 (triiodothyronine), help the body to produce and regulate the hormones adrenaline (also called epinephrine) and dopamine.Hormones are chemical substances that help control certain cells and organs.ther hormones from this gland also help regulate metabolism, which is the process by which calories and oxygen are converted into energy. Without a functioning thyroid, the body would not be able to break down proteins and it would not be able to process carbohydrates and vitamins.
