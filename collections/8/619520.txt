What is disability insurance? It is income paid to you weekly or monthly when you canâ€™t work because of sickness or injury. The pay out provided may be stated as a percentage of income or as a set dollar amount. The policy defines how much you will be paid, how soon after you are disabled payments appear in your mailbox, and when they will cease. Benefits periods may depend on whether the disability was caused by an accident or illness.
