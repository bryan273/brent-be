A. Pyelonephritis results when a urinary tract infection progresses from the bladder and urethra to involve the upper urinary system (the kidneys and ureters). Pyelonephritis is a potentially serious kidney infection that can spread to the blood, causing severe illness.Fortunately, pyelonephritis is almost always curable with antibiotics. Most cases of pyelonephritis are acute, meaning sudden and self-limited.After cure with antibiotics, there is rarely any lasting damage to the kidneys. Most people do not develop pyelonephritis again.hronic (long-lasting) pyelonephritis is a rare condition, usually caused by birth defects in the kidney. Repeated UTIs (usually in children) result in progressive damage and scarring in the kidney. This can eventually cause kidney failure.
