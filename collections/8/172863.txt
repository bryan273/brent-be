Constipation - Causes. Causes of constipation. Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry. Most cases of constipation aren't caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause.
