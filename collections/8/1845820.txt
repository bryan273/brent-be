Dog flu symptoms resemble kennel cough symptoms, which is also an illness that you should talk to your veterinarian about as soon as you notice symptoms. Most cases of dog flu are mild, but severe cases do occur. In these cases, dogs develop pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and a high fever. Luckily, the mortality rate of dog flu is relatively low, with less than 10 percent of dog flu cases resulting in fatalities.
