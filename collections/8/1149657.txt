--Tan, 18, Houston, TX. Whenever I have flaky skin, I use Jergens Skin Smoothing Moisturizer. It's not too greasy, so you can even use it on your face. --Kayla, 14, Bemidji, MN. When I get a sunburn and my skin starts to peel, I usually use cocoa butter. It smells really good and makes the peeling go away fast..
