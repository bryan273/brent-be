Cholestasis is reduction or stoppage of bile flow. Disorders of the liver, bile duct, or pancreas can cause cholestasis. The skin and whites of the eyes look yellow, the skin itches, urine is dark, and stools may become light-colored and smell foul. Laboratory and often imaging tests are needed to identify the cause.
