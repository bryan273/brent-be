Phototherapy involves using ultraviolet A and/or B light waves to treat mild to moderate skin rashes (e.g., psoriasis) in adults and children over the age of 12. In some cases, a drug called psoralen is used in combination with phototherapy. Patients who are receiving phototherapy are monitored carefully during treatment.
