We raise money to fund research for cures for skin disease and skin cancer, but research doesn't fund itself. We are the UK's only charity dedicated to skin research, and all of our donations and fundraising events are crucial to enabling us to continue our work. We have supported more than 300 research projects and awarded Â£15 million in funding across all skin diseases including eczema, psoriasis and many more.
