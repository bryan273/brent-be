Although most muscle cramps are harmless, some may be related to an underlying medical condition, such as: 1  Inadequate blood supply. Narrowing of the arteries that deliver blood to your legs (arteriosclerosis of the extremities) can produce cramp-like pain in your legs and feet while you're exercising. 2  Nerve compression.
