Tartar, also known as calculus, is plaque that has not been properly removed and has hardened onto the surface of the tooth. Unlike plaque, tartar is visible. It is a yellow or yellowish brown deposit that encrusts the tooth along the gumline. It is much stronger than plaque and is difficult to remove; brushing and flossing will not remove tartar. Tartar must be removed by a dental professional.
