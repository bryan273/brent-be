Heart palpitations are described as feeling like your heart is racing or pounding. Palpitations can be caused by anxiety, panic disorders, overeating, pregnancy, and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Most palpitations are not serious, however, palpitations caused by a heart condition like atrial fibrillation or Afib can be serious and require medical treatment.
