Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema that is due to a direct problem with the heart is called cardiogenic. Congestive heart failure is a common cause of cardiogenic pulmonary edema; in this condition, the left ventricle cannot pump out enough blood to meet the needs of the body. This causes a buildup of pressure in other parts of the circulatory system, forcing fluid into the air sacs of the lungs and other parts of the body.
