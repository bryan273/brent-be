They are typically quite itchy and have been known to cause a prickly or burning sensation - especially if touched. Stress hives can appear on any part of your body (face, hands, feet, arms, etc.) and can vary in size from as small as the eraser on a pencil to as large as a dinner plate. Stress hives, like a typical hives rash, have been known to spread from place to place, and smaller areas of hives can blend together to create larger areas known as plaques.
