Next. I'm looking to build an outhouse building in the garden within the constraints of the regulations set out for outdoor buildings that require no planning permission.I am looking for approximated costs for each part of the build for use as comparisons. I will be doing a lot of the work myself but need help with... would allow upwards of Â£500 per square metre-but it depends on things like-do you need power and water or drainage-how much insulation and what standard of internal finish-and any fire protection requirements depending on its siting-how easy the site is to get to and what state it is in..
