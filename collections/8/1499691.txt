Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus) can cause seizures. Researchers report that seizures occur from lupus at the onset of their disease in less than 5% of patients. Seizures occur from lupus during their lifetime in approximately 10% of patients. Seizures are one of the classical 11 criteria that are used to diagnose Lupus, see our Focus on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Thank you for your question.
