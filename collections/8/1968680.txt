You may need to switch between types of shampoos if one type controls the dandruff at first but later loses its effectiveness. How often you should use dandruff shampoo varies from daily to a couple of times a week. Check the directions on the bottle. When shampooing your hair, rub the shampoo into your scalp well. Leave the shampoo on your head for 5 minutes, or as directed, before you rinse.
