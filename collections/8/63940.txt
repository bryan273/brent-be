The term nucleus is from the Latin word nucleus, a diminutive of nux (nut), meaning the kernel (i.e., the small nut) inside a watery type of fruit (like a peach). In 1844, Michael Faraday used the term to refer to the central point of an atom. The modern atomic meaning was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1912.
