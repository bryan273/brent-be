An at-home pregnancy test can't measure the exact amount of pregnancy hormone in your urine. What it can do is detect whether a minimum amount is present. Getting a negative pregnancy test result doesn't mean your urine doesn't contain hCG. It just means it doesn't contain enough to trigger a positive result.
