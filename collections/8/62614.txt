Items typically eligible for trade dress protection are product designs, product packaging, and the appearance and decor of a service business. For trade dress to be protectable under trademark law, the design must be non-functional, distinctive, and identify the source of the goods or services. A design is functional if it isessential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article. Additionally, trade dress must be distinctive to identify the source of the good or service. Trade dress can be inherently distinctive or acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning.
