Chronic alcohol abuse causes alcoholic liver disease (also called alcohol-induced liver disease). Alcoholic liver disease includes fatty liver (build-up of fat cells in the liver), alcoholic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver caused by heavy drinking), and alcoholic cirrhosis. In the liver, alcohol converts to toxic chemicals that trigger inflammation and tissue injury. This process leads to cirrhosis.
