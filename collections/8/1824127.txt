Veterinarians who have seen a cat with untreated feline hyperthyroidism often see cats that have grown very sick over the years. A cat with untreated hyperthyroidism may stop eating altogether. It may also exhibit blood in its stools. These are very serious symptoms, but internal changes are even more serious. Feline hyperthyroidism, untreated, can cause serious heart problems. This is because the catâ€™s heart must work harder to match the state of its overactive metabolism.
