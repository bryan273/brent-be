The mean or the median or the 3rd quartile or ... trip times may all be valid figures to use. The two airlines may use a different terminal at one or both ends with different taxi and processing times. An airline may choose to fly a less aggressive more fuel efficient flight profile.hey may have different security arrangements. For example, on some flights that I have taken, at some airports QANTAS have their own portable XRay machine and re XRay passengers luggage at the gate. You'd not expect this to affect shown transit time but it could depending how they determine these figures.
