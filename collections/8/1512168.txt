Definition of Shock. •In 1852, shock was defined as “a rude unhinging. of the machinery of life.” Probably no better. definition exists to describe the devastating. effects of this process on a patient, but a more. recent definition calls shock “the collapse and. progressive failure of the cardiovascular system.”. •Shock left untreated may be fatal.
