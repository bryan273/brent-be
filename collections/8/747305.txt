These blighters can cause irritation, skin blemishes and more itchiness. Unlike virgin beard itch, veteran beard itch has more to do with the skin under the beard, rather than the beard hair itself. One of the main causes of veteran beard itch is dry skin. If you have dry flakes of skin in your beard then you've got beard ruff which is usually a pretty good sign that the skin underneath your beard is not moist enough to form a healthy barrier to the elements which will make it prone to itching.
