Hobica also said the airlines don't particularly want travelers to fly one-way, as it upsets airline travel schedules. To get an idea of current one-way fare prices, I searched for flights on a number of airfare providers (big airlines, domestic airlines and online travel booking sites).Some of the exorbitant one-way tickets I found were shocking -- others were easier on the pocketbook.hings changed when I searched for one-way flights. A one-way flight from New York to Paris cost $736 with taxes on Aer Lingus and $489 with taxes on Expedia (again, flying on XL Airways France).
