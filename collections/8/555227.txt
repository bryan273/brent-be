In men, a testicular infection, tumor or twisting of the left testicle commonly causes pain that radiates from the testicle into the left side of the abdomen and back. When to See Your Doctor. Call your doctor right away if you develop abdominal and back pain, especially if it doesn't go away in a few days or worsens.
