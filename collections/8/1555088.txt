There are different methods used to stop sciatic nerve pain. Generally, it is advisable to try out some of the treatment options before surgery is considered. The ice pack treatment involves lying flat with two flat pillows placed under the knees. Place ice on the side where the nerve is inflamed. Place it on the lower back, the buttock on the side affected or tailbone for up to 20 minutes every 2-3 hours. This helps to decrease inflammation in the sciatic nerve and relieving pain albeit temporarily.
