Signs of celiac disease begin to show not only in childhood patterns, but can also develop at more mature ages. What causes celiac disease is often linked to hereditary reasons, certain genetic disorders, and autoimmune disease. Some indicators can include anemia, bad liver function, autoimmune thyroid disease, Down syndrome, Microscopic colitis (colon inflammation), and Turner Sydrome (an incomplete sex chromosome).
