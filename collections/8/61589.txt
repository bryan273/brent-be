EPDM rubber roofing average installation cost is $4.00 to $6.00 per square foot, or about $6,000 to $9,000 for a 15 square (1,500 square feet) flat roof. The cost may be higher or lower depending on the tear-off and removal cost of the existing roof, insulation layers, and the number of penetrations on your flat roof. Install Roof Shingles.
