New genetic cause of osteoporosis found, rare gene identified. By: Bel Marra Health | Osteoporosis | Tuesday, September 15, 2015 - 17:30 PM. A rare gene – the EN1 gene – has been identified as a potential osteoporosis cause by researchers at McGill University.With the use of extensive genetic data from the UK10K project, the research team uncovered that a variant of the EN1 gene has a large effect on bone mineral density (BMD).ew genetic cause of osteoporosis found, rare gene identified.
