The inner core, which is about 750 miles thick, is made primarily of iron. Unlike the outer core, the inner core is mostly solid. Although the iron in the inner core is even hotter (10,000º F or more — as hot as the surface of the Sun!) than the outer core, the intense pressure from the rest of the planet is so great that the iron cannot melt.
