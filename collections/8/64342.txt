Here are some things that can affect enzyme activity: 1  Temperature - The temperature can affect the reaction rate. The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction will occur. 2  pH - In many cases the pH level, or acidity, of the environment around the enzyme and substrate can affect the reaction rate.
