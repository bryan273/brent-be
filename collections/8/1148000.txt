Main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. A blockage inside of the appendix causes appendicitis and can lead to increased pressure, problems with blood flow and inflammation. The appendix can become blocked by feces, a foreign object, or rarely, a tumor. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen.
