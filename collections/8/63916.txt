According to May 2016 US Department of Labor statistics, US architects earn between $46,600 and $129,810 a year. Half of all architects earn $76,930 or moreâ€”and half earn less. The mean annual wage is $84,470 per year, and the mean hourly wage rate is $40.61. These figures exclude landscape and naval architects, the self-employed, and owners and partners of unincorporated firms. Landscape architects do not fare as well.
