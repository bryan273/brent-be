Oral thrush can affect anyone, although it's most common in babies younger than 6 months of age and in older adults. A baby with oral thrush might develop cracked skin in the corners of the mouth or whitish patches on the lips, tongue, or inside the cheeks that look a little like cottage cheese but can't be wiped away.
