Corn, lentils, winter squash and olives are all vegetables that are high in acid. For example, corn has a pH of 5.2, while lentils and olives have pH levels of 6.3 and 6, respectively. They still have fiber and other nutrients, but they are not good choices if you are trying to lower the levels of acid in your body.
