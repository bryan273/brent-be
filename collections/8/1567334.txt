Ai = Love. Josei = Woman. So, shoujo ai is Girl's Love/GL Girls who love girls. Shounen ai is Boy's Love/BL Boy who love boys. People tend to use shounen ai and shoujo ai for stories that are not sexually explicit. Wheras yaoi and yuri tend to mean that there will be sexually explicit content. Josei has nothing to do with bromance though.
