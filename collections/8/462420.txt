Foods To Avoid. If you have acid reflux disease, some of the foods you should avoid may seem obvious. For example, spicy foods are often linked to the symptoms of acid reflux disease. However, many of the foods which trigger acid reflux are not as obvious.1  Acidic foods like tomatoes, citrus fruits and onions are among these seemingly innocuous foods.ince acidic fruits and veggies, spicy foods and high-fat dishes are the main triggers for acid reflux, it's important to look for alternatives to these foods. 1  Choose lean meats like skinless chicken breasts, extra-lean ground beef or fish, and always opt for a milder dish rather than a spicy one.
