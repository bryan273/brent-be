The three functions of the pancreas are to produce enzymes for digestion, to produce bicarbonate to neutralize gastric acid, and to produce insulin to signal cells in the body to begin taking nutrients out of the blood in anticipation of digestion and absorption of food. The major test include: Enzyme secretion testing. The most accurate way to test for enzyme secretion is direct function testing. The method is to place a hose, tube or catheter at, on into the pancreatic duct, and measure pancreatic secretion for a about 90 minutes (depending on the test) after stimulating the pancreas with a hormone (e.g. CCK) or a test meal.
