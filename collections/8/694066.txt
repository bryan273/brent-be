3. Drop the Corn in the Water: Carefully drop in freshly shucked corn into the boiling water. Poke the ears a little bit so each side gets covered in water. 3. Cook the Corn: Cover the pot with a lid and lower heat to medium. Set a timer. For just softened corn kernels, cook for 4 minutes. If you like softer corn, cook for 6-8 minutes. 4. Serve the Corn: Serve corn immediately with butter and flaky salt.
