Mouth sores and inflammation (stomatitis) vary in appearance and size and can affect any part of the mouth, including the lips. People may have swelling and redness of the lining of the mouth or individual, painful ulcers. An ulcer is a hole that forms in the lining of the mouth when the top layer of cells breaks down.
