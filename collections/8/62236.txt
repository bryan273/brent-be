What is an epidural steroid injection? An epidural steroid injection is a common procedure to treat spinal nerve irritation that is most often caused by tissues next to the nerve pressing against it. The beginning of the nerve (nerve root) may be irritated by a bulging intervertebral disc, disc contents (ruptured disc) or bone spur, directly touching the spinal nerve.
