V. Mass and Weight. [NOTE 1, See page 6] The mass of an object is a measure of the objectâ€™s inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The weight of an object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force needed to support it. The pull of gravity on the earth gives an object a downward acceleration of about 9.8 m/s 2. In trade and commerce and everyday use, the term weight is often used as a synonym for mass..
