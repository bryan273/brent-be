Ton/Km per litre-Assume a truck completes a 250 km trip in 4 hours 30 minutes (4,5 hrs). The vehicle can take a legal payload of 10 tons; however, its load for this trip is 9 tons.Fuel consumed for the journey is 105 litres.Average Speed: 250 km/ 4.5 hours = 55.5 km/h or 69% of the 80km/h highway speed limit.uel Used expressed in Ton/Km-litre: 499.5/ 23.3 litres/hr = 21.43 Ton/Km-litre/hr. Assume that after review of the operation a few improvements can be achieved. The 250 kilometre trip is now completed in 4 hours and the full payload of 10 tons is carried.
