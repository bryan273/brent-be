Hello, I have been expierencing symptoms of a brain tumor, but my doctor says its my anxiety (wich I have, bad) my question to you is, do brain tumor symptom come and go? Like numbness and tingling and pain and dizziness? Thank you for your time.he answer is yes, symptoms come and go, appear then fade away. Remember, our bodies are natural healing machines designed to repair themselves. Anxiety is a touchy or tricky thing Dave, it produces stress and stress can manipulate, mimic, and copy symptoms of many diseases.
