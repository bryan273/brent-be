To stay adequately hydrated, you should drink approximately three quarts (96 ounces) of water a day. For weight loss, you should drink an additional 8 ounces of water for every 25 pounds you are over your ideal body weight. Also, water consumption should be increased in hot climates or during vigorous exercise. Please note; water will not cause you to lose weight alone.
