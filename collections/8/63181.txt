Potatoes are started from seed pieces rather than from true seed. These seed pieces may be small whole potatoes or potatoes that are cut into 1-1/2 to 2 ounce pieces. Plant the pieces soon after cutting. Be sure that there is at least one good eye in each seed piece. Some garden centers and seed suppliers sell potato eyes that weigh less than an ounce.
