Pelvic organ prolapse can also occur after surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) for another health problem, such as endometriosis. Removal of the uterus can sometimes leave the other organs in the pelvic area with less support. Other conditions that may cause pelvic organ prolapse include: Obesity, which can lead to long-term pressure within the abdomen. Smoking and/or lung disorders, which are often causes of chronic coughing.
