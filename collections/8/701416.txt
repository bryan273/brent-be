The age when the symptoms of perimenopause occur varies. Most women notice perimenopausal symptoms between the ages of 45 and 55; age 51 is the average age for a woman to have her final menstrual period. (Some women never experience any unpleasant symptoms; they just stop menstruating when their bodies decide itâ€™s time.)
