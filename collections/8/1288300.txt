Radiation treatment for prostate cancer requires accuracy and precision. With advanced radiation therapy delivery systems, our radiation oncologists are better able to target difficult-to-reach tumors in the prostate. Also, our radiation oncologists can direct higher radiation doses at prostate cancer cells, while reducing exposure to normal, healthy tissue. We offer two primary types of radiation therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: External beam radiation therapy (EBRT): Delivers high doses of radiation to prostate cancer cells from outside the body, using a variety of machine-based technologies.
