Here, an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step. This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases.ere, an enzyme such as DNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step.
