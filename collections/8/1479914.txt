Severe forms of canine mast cell cancer are characterized by ulcerative lesions, with the content of the ulcers flowing consistently flowing out. Affected dogs will likely experience generalized symptoms as well, which include vomiting, ulcerative pain in the stomach and abdomen. Blood may pass in the feces. A heightened inflammatory response is noted in dogs with mast cell cancer, due to the excessive release of histamine and other factors.
