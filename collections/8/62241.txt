Lumbar spinal stenosis may cause pain that radiates from the lower spine to the hips or down the legs. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are used for leg pain rather than back pain from lumbar spinal stenosis. Steroid injections may help relieve pain for a short time (2 to 3 weeks) in some people. Experts do not know how well injections work over longer periods of time.
