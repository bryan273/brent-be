There are many causes of thrombocytopenia. Your doctor may tell you that you have a form of the condition called immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is one of the most common causes of low platelets in people who do not have symptoms. You may hear it referred to by its old name, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
