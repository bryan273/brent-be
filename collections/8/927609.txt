Over time, hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. If you can't push your hernia back into your belly, it is incarcerated. A hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. This is not necessarily an emergency.
