Expect to get at least five potatoes per plant. Potatoes are grown from seed potatoes, which are potato pieces cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes with at least two eyes. You have a wide choice of potato cultivars, including russet, red and yellow varieties. Potatoes also come in early, late and mid-season varieties that vary in length of time to harvest. Potato yield varies by variety and growing conditions. On average, you can expect about five to 10 potatoes per plant.
