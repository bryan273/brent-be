This type of pain has many possible causes. Referred pain- that is pain coming from internal organs - needs to be considered. For instance, the pain associated with esophagitis, stomach ulcers, and pancreatitis may cause pain under the right shoulder blade. Any problem that causes irritation of the diaphragm can also cause shoulder blade pain.
