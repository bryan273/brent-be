Thigh weakness has many causes, including a charley horse, sciatica and spinal stenosis. It can be a side effect of taking certain medications. Extended bed rest or having to wear a cast or other immobilizer for long periods also can lead to thigh weakness. The problem often is accompanied by other symptoms.
