In fact, the cost of rubber roofing varies depending on the selected materials, complexity of the installation, your location and other factors. 1  Usually rubber roof shingles cost about $4.00 – $8.00 per ft². For example, if the surface area of your roof is 1,500 ft², be ready to pay $6,000 – $12,000. Single-ply rubber roofing usually costs $2.50 – $5.00 per ft². However, the price may rise up to $10.00 or more per ft² due to a tricky installation and high-end materials. Thus, a 1,500 ft² roof, for instance, will cost you about $4,000 – $15,000. Rubber roofing can be installed over the existing covering.
