Cross-reactions may occur between the residual parts of plant proteins in the latex rubber and proteins in foods just like cross-reactions between pollen and foods. The most commonly reported cross-reactive foods include banana, avocado, kiwi, and chestnut together with papaya, fig, potato, and tomato. Around 30-80% of people with latex allergy experience symptoms when they eat one or more of these foods.
