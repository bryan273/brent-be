A petechia, (plural Petechiae) refers to a small red or purple pin point dot on the body, due to broken capillary blood vessels. Events that cause an increase in pressure, such as coughing or vomiting can cause petechiae around the face or eyes. Minor trauma is another common cause of petechiae. In general, petechiae are commonly seen and usually of no concern.
