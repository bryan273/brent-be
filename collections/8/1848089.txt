The weak interaction is responsible for beta decay. The exchange particles for the weak interaction are the W+ , the W-and the Z0. Consider β decay. n → p. We can describe the process as follows. A neutron changes into a proton by emitting a W - , which quickly decays into an electron and an antineutrino.ote: that in some reactions quarks can be created in quark-antiquark pairs, but the net flavour of quarks before and after is unchanged as they created pairs cancel. Another example of the weak interaction is the interaction between a proton and an electron called electron capture.
