Gentian violet (1%) sometimes works as treatment for thrush. It is a dye that kills bacteria and fungi, and it is available without a prescription. Talk to your doctor before using gentian violet. If you develop thrush and have false teeth (dentures), it is important to clean your mouth and dentures every night.
