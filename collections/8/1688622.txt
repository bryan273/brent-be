Stretch marks. Stretch marks are narrow streaks or lines that occur on the surface of the skin. Doctors often refer to stretch marks as stria, striae or – during pregnancy – striae gravidarum. Stretch marks are often red or purple to start with, before gradually fading to a silvery-white colour. They're usually long and thin.
