Revolutionary science, often 'fringe science' questions the paradigm itself. Kuhn originally believed that a paradigm would make a sudden leap from one to the next, called a shift, and he believed that the new paradigm could not be built upon the foundations of the old. Probably the best example of this is in physics.
