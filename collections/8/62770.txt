Shimano Tyrnos Reel. does anyone know the type of gear used by Jeremy Wade(river monsters)? i searched up some info about him but all i found were 2 reels he uses/usedâ€¦i would like to know the rod also or at least the rod company so i can get an idea of a good rod and company. *im aware of the 2-speed Tyrnos 30 provided by Shimano and the Shimano Tiagra 50.
