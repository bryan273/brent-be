Influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccines, also known as flu shots or jabs, are vaccines that protect against influenza. A new version of the vaccine is developed twice a year as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza.
