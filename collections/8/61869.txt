Whether or not you should take a class is really a personal decision depending on your interests and what kind of course load you want. If what you're really asking is will taking physics affect my computer science education, then the answer is no. I graduated with an EECS degree that had a physics requirement. It was completely unrelated to CS in every way. Taking physics won't make you a better computer scientist and won't affect you down the road.
