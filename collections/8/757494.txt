Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected. The gums tend to bleed after you brush or floss your teeth, and the blood in your mouth causes the metallic taste. If left untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected (known as periodontitis).
