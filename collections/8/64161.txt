Growing up in Detroit, Aretha Franklin and her sisters Carolyn and Erma sang in a choir directed by gospel great James Cleveland at the church pastored by their father, Rev. C.L. Franklin. Years later, their church-honed harmonies would be heard on hits issued on Atlantic Records during Aretha Franklin's mid-'60s heyday. While her pumpin' million-sellers such as Respect and Think may be better known, Ain't No Way, a tender gem written by Carolyn Franklin, is one of the singer's best sides. The low-key ballad has a sparse mix that highlights Aretha's aching lead vocal and the pensive tone of the lyrics.
