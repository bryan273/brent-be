The reflection of a wave is simply a process by which a wave, whether light, sound, infrared, or radio waves, hits an object and bounces off it. But this reflection looks quite different for a mirror than it does for a wall. Law of Reflection. When any wave, including light, hits a surface that is opaque, the light will mostly reflect off that surface. The law of reflection tells us how it bounces off that surface. When a wave is moving toward the surface, it's called the 'incident ray.' When it bounces off, it's call the 'reflected ray.'
