Blue Moon is an American-made, Belgian style white beer. Most beer is brewed using barley, but Blue Moon and other weizen or wit beers are brewed from wheat. If you want to try others, you might look at the other beers Blue Moon offers, other wheat beers (most breweries offer one), and/or other Belgian-style beers. Cheers!
