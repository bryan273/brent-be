Definition: Illness. Illness refers to the sociocultural context within which disease is experienced. The patient and his/her family label, classify, and explain the sickness episode in such a way that it can be personally and socially meaningful (Kleinman 1978).or many adults, the functional component is a critical factor in defining health or illness--in the absence of symptoms, there is no disease. A world view of many cultural groups integrates physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, and holds that all three are necessary for optimal health.
