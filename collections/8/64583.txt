Most of the island’s restaurants, hotels, stores, and dive shops are concentrated downtown and along the two hotel zones that fan out on the leeward coast to the north and south of San Miguel. Cozumel’s solitude-seeking windward side has a few beach-bar restaurants, one hotel, and miles of deserted beaches.
