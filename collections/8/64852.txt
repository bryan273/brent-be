Transverse wave: If the vibrations of the particles of the medium conveying a wave are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave, the wave is called a transverse wave. Longitudinal wave vs Transverse wave. Longitudinal wave. Transverse waves. Particles in the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. The particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction propagation of the wave. The wave travels in the form of condensations and rarefactions. The wave travels in the form of crests and troughs. One condensation and a rarefaction constitute one wave.
