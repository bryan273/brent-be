Parsley: Parsley leaves are excellent natural home remedies for skin abscess and boils that cure them over short intervals of time that too without causing any infections or pain. Take 5 to 6 parsley leaves and boil them in water. After the water gets the first boil, take them out and put them over your skin boils as a bandage.
