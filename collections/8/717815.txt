2 How long does it take for a broken blood vessel in the eye to heal? Depends: broken blood vessel is actually not a very specific diagnosis. If a small hemorrhage on the eye surface is meant, then it will typically heal and all blood resorbed within 1-2 weeks. If there is a problem in the back of the eye, it may be the tip of the iceberg.
