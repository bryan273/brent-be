About 1 in 10 people with discoid lupus eventually develop systemic lupus, and about 3 in 10 people with systemic lupus have discoid lupus rashes. Drug-induced lupus can develop with certain medicines. In a very small number of people, certain prescription medicines lead to the development of S.L.E. symptoms.
