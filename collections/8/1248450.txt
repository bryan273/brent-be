Medical conditions such as thyroid disease, low blood sugar, anemia, and low blood pressure also may cause palpitations. Heart palpitations may be a sign or symptom of arrhythmia, an irregular heartbeat, or other heart conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, heart valve disease, or cardiomyopathy. Although palpitations are very common and usually harmless, they can be frightening when they happen and may cause anxiety.
