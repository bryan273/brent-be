Purchase certified russet seed potatoes from your local garden center or nursery. Cut the potatoes into 2- to 4-ounce pieces, making sure that each piece has at least one eye. Store the freshly cut pieces at room temperature in a dark, humid place for one to three days to give the cuts time to dry before planting.
