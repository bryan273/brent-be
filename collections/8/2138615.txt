1 doctor agreed: Mittelschmerz: ovulation pain (mittelschmerz) is cause by first the actual rupture of the cyst causing a sharp sudden pain with some residual discomfort afterwards. But many ovulated cysts will also bleed slightly and the blood irritates the perineum causing often a couple days of crampy to sharp pain.
