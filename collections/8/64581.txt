The study of waves therefore forms a topic of central importance in all physical science and engineering. 1  The simplest types of wave motion are vibrations of elastic media, such as air, crystalline solids, or stretched strings. If, for example, the surface of a metal block is struck a sharp blow, the deformation of the surface material compresses the metal in the vicinity of the surface, and this transmits the disturbance to the layers beneath.
