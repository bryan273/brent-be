A collapsed lung, also known as a pneumothorax, occurs when air escapes out of a lung and becomes trapped inside the space between the chest and lung cavities. This can be caused by air blisters in the lungs that break open, sudden air pressure changes, or trauma to the chest or ribcage. The building pressure causes all or a portion of a lung to collapse. A collapsed lung requires medical attention, and patience during the healing process.
