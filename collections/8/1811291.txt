If your skin becomes too oily you can use an oil free cleanser to clean your face. Other than that, do nothing but smile! If you have a problem with acne already, your acne may become more irritated during pregnancy. The extra hormones in your body cause your oil glands to secrete more oil, which can cause breakouts. You should keep a strict cleansing routine. You can start with a simple over-the-counter face soap.
