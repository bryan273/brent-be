Just like humans, cats can develop allergies to things in the environment. Cat allergies can be caused by many different things, and the cause usually has to be figured out by a process of elimination. Sneezing that's caused by an allergy is often accompanied by scratching and other skin problems. These include frequent rubbing of the face and excessive grooming which may cause hair loss.
