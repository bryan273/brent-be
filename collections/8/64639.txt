I know quakers are much more hardy than cockatiels and can withstand lower temperatures,... show more So I'm buying a young quaker parrot (less than a year old). I've owned cockatiels and parakeets before but never a parrot. I've researched it alot but can't seem to find the degrees that the bird can live in. I know quakers are much more hardy than cockatiels and can withstand lower temperatures, but my house is 63 degrees and i don't know if i should use a heat lamp on it or not. (my cockatiel always needed the heat lamp).
