A Dr. Mehmet Oz, MD , Cardiology (Cardiovascular Disease), answered. The white patches caused by the skin condition vitiligo can spread to other locations or can stay in one area. The course is unpredictable and varies from person to person. Some people with vitiligo say that new patches form on skin that is under pressure or exposed to friction. This can happen from shaving or rubbing from jewelry or clothing.
