As you age, your skin is affected by the daily wear and tear of life -- so it's no wonder that your skin eventually loses some of its elasticity. Skin elasticity is the skin's ability to stretch and then go back to normal once the need to stretch is gone [source: Columbia University ].roblems with skin elasticity can also arise after a person loses a large amount of weight in a short period of time. Skin often cannot keep up with the sudden changes the body has been through, and it may not shrink back to the same size as the body, leaving unsightly excess skin behind.
