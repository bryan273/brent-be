I think illegal means the act is against the law, no matter what. Unlawful would be an act which is illegal under certain circumstances, but could be legal if procedures are followed. For example, it is illegal to rob, kill, or speed under any circumstances.But, unlawful assembly is perfectly legal if you have a permit. That's what I believe divides the two terms.f something is unlawful it is illegal. ie. if it is against the law, it is illegal.
