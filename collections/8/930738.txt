Experiencing Indigestion. Bloating after everything you eat may be a sign of chronic indigestion, or dyspepsia. Indigestion occurs when stomach acid comes into contact with the sensitive tissue that lines your esophagus. In addition to bloating, you may experience heartburn, nausea and an uncomfortable fullness. You may also feel the urge to belch frequently.
