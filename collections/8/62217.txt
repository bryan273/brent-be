I only work weekends 4 minutes ago Oh, i wasn't even meant to be rostered for that day.complete change of tone on my bosses part) well, everybody's sick lauren (this was done in a mocking way, like i was faking it to get out of work) *i stay silent* fine, but you will need to provide a doctors certificate. This seems a little off to me. I'm missing 5 hours of work. I'm only 15.
