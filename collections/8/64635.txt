Regardless of a parrotâ€™s natural place of origin, the only climate that matters is the one in which they live. Most companion parrots are not acclimated to cold temperatures. They have adapted to the temperatures common within our homes, generally between 65 and 72 degrees (18c-22c). While they are capable of enduring much lower temperatures, they are not prepared to.
