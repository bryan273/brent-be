The most common symptoms of MAC are persistent fevers plus night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, tiredness or worsening diarrhea. Symptoms of early disease often involve the gut: stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. Disseminated disease can lead to bone, brain or skin infections, or cause painful joints. Signs of MAC include swollen abdominal lymph nodes, usually on only one side of the body, and an enlarged liver and spleen.
