One of the paths leads right out onto the river bed above the falls, and its steps are carved into the bed rock. The Middle Lewis River Falls trail is a bit longer than the lower. From the parking area, the trail descends gently to the river and flows it north to a viewing area below the middle falls. The Upper Lewis River Falls trail begins along Forest Road #90 just before the Quartz Creek bridge.
