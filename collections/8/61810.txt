Even Nintendo.com doesn't have much info and they wont allow you to contact them in regards to the Wii U. I preordered the Wii U for my kids, they currently have the Wii with 4 wiimotes (1 has the wii plus add on) Now , they want to keep using the wii separately from the Wii U. Does the Wii U come with a sensor bar?
