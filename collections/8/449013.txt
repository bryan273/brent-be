Leukocytes in urine are not a dangerous condition, but they are a sign that you are suffering from an infection or damage. Leukocytes are white blood cells (WBC) that work with the immune system to defend against infectious disease. Damage to the kidneys, ureters, urethra or bladder can cause leukocytes to appear.
