High-flow priapism is typically caused by injury; injury can be to the perineum or to the spinal cord. Other causes of spinal cord dysfunction including spinal stenosis, sacral tumours, transverse myelitis, epidural haematoma, transurethral surgery or spinal anaesthesia can, rarely, cause high-flow priapism.
