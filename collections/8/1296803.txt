It is the hands of health-care staff that is the principal cause of contact transmission from patient to patient (Larson, 1988). The importance of assiduous handwashing by healthcare workers, accordingly, cannot be overemphasized for reducing hospital-acquired infections.hile most infections are not directly transmitted to patients from environmental surfaces, these surfaces come in contact with the hands of caregivers frequently. As discussed earlier, low hand-washing compliance is a problem in healthcare facilities.
