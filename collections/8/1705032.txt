The most common “internal” cause for pain leading to the right shoulder blade is gall bladder disease. The term for this is “biliary colic.”. Biliary colic is an ache in the upper abdomen, under the right rib cage. It occurs when gallstones interfere with the normal flow of bile from the gallbladder.
