In 1835 the two Dutchmen Sibrandus Stratingh and Christopher Becker built an electric motor that powered a small model car. This is the first known practical application of an electric motor. In February 1837 the first patent for an electric motor was granted to the US-american Thomas Davenport. However, all the early developments by Jacobi, Stratingh, Davenport and others eventually did not lead to the electric motors we know today. The DC motor was not created from these engines, but rather from the development of power generators (dynamometers).
