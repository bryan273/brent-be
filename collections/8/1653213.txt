What are blisters? A blister is a collection of clear fluid trapped between or beneath the top layer of skin, the epidermis. Blisters, which are often called “water blisters,” often break open and the fluid inside is released onto the skin. Blisters, also known as vesicles, can occur in all age groups and populations. A blood blister is a specific type of blister that is due to damage to blood vessels and tissues just under the skin, which causes blood and other fluids to pool and form a bump. Blood blisters typically form after a strong pinch of the tissues, but there are other causes as well.
