What Causes Cold Sores and Fever Blisters? Both cold sore and fever blister refer to the lip blisters caused by infections of the Herpes Simplex I virus (not to be confused with Herpes Simplex II, which is generally associated with genital herpes). Cold Sores are viral infections which cause recurrent groups of irritating, even painful blisters on the lips.
