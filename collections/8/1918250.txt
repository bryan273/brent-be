Thrombotic strokes are strokes caused by a thrombus (blood clot) that develops in the arteries supplying blood to the brain. This type of stroke is usually seen in older persons, especially those with high cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis (a buildup of fat and lipids inside the walls of blood vessels) or diabetes.
