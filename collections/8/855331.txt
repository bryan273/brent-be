Michael Smith, MD: While you’re out enjoying the sun this summer, make sure you’re drinking lots of water. The side effects of dehydration can range from embarrassing, like bad breath, to dangerous, like passing out ... even heat stroke. Many people are mildly dehydrated and don’t even know it. Dry mouth and increased thirst might be obvious signs, but there are other signs like fatigue, headaches, and dizziness. Dehydration can even affect your mood and concentration. A new study found that dehydrated drivers made the same number of mistakes on the road as drunk drivers.
