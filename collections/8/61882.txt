Foreclosure is the legal process that allows your lender to take ownership of your property if you don’t pay your mortgage. The process usually begins after you miss 4 payments (when your account is 120 days past due). If we can’t find another solution — such as a loan modification or short sale — the process ends with your home being sold in a foreclosure sale. We want to help you prevent that outcome. Even after the foreclosure process begins, please work closely with us to find other options.
