Angioedema is caused by an allergic reaction to something you've eaten, an insect bite, pollen allergies, or a medication you've taken. 1  It causes a swelling of the lips, face, and tongue, which usually occurs rapidly. It can also sometimes be accompanied by redness or bumps (hives). Due to the swelling, you may have difficulty talking. Angioedema can also cause swelling of the airway and difficulty breathing, which may be life-threatening.
