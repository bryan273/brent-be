Hot Wire anemometers are used for low velocity measurements and require corrections for high accuracy measurements. Hot wires are ideal for airflow measurements at fume hoods and other low flow applications. Capture Hoods Capture hoods are used for measuring air velocity and volume at registers and grills. Most hoods use differential pressure or hot wire technology for measurement.
