A collection of excess fluid anywhere in the body is known as edema. Your entire foot or a portion of your foot may appear larger than normal. The swelling may be painless or accompanied by a variety of symptoms, including bruising, itchiness, pain, numbness, redness, stiffness and tenderness. Foot swelling may be a symptom of a condition or an injury affecting the foot or the whole body. The severity of swelling largely depends on its underlying cause. For example, standing or sitting for extended periods may cause minor and temporary foot swelling. Severe swelling may be the result of an injury, such as a broken bone or sprain, or a medical condition, such as heart failure or arthritis.
