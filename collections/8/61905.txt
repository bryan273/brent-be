Look Out For Runout. Just because you can't feel a lot of free play or wobble in a wheel doesn't mean there isn't enough to cause vibration. It doesn't take a lot to be responsible for objectionable vibration at speeds of 60 to 70 mph and aboveany deviation from a truly circular spin is called runout.
