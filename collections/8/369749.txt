Spotting is a common concern that many pregnant women face. Approximately 20% of women report they experience spotting during their first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Bleeding that occurs early on in pregnancy is usually lighter in flow than a menstrual period. Also, the color often varies from red to brown. Although it is easy to be concerned, donâ€™t panic.
