Non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk factors. In most cases, it is not known what causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Some individuals without any of the known risk factors may still develop the disease. It is not clear why certain factors may increase your risk, or how a particular factor may affect the likelihood of developing NHL. Some of the risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be beyond our control, such as age and gender. Our lifestyle choices may also play a role in our risk for developing the disease. Some studies are exploring how a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables may actually lower the risk of lymphoma.
