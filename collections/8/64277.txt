The Marshall Dillon Band (MDB) was started in the early spring of 2012. The goal was to create a new upbeat high energy country band to keep the crowd on their feet and the dance floor full. They are a seven-piece country band playing modern and classic country music covering artists from Jason Aldean, Miranda Lambert, and Luke Bryan to Tracy Byrd, Patty Loveless, and Charlie Daniels.
