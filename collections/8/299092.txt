The pressure of the blood inside the artery causes the weaker section of wall to balloon. Aneurysms can occur in any artery, but they most commonly occur in the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the section of the aorta that passes through the tummy (abdomen). These are known as abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).
