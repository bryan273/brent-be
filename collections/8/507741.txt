Beans and Legumes. Beans are low-cal and packed with protein and fiber, which help you tone up and lose weight. Make a bean-heavy dish, such as burritos, instead of meat once a week. You'll cut a lot of saturated fat and replace it with fiber. Watch out: Refried beans are high in saturated fat. Choose plain black, pinto, or other varieties instead.
