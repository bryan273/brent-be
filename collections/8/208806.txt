Chamomile and Lavender. Used separately, chamomile and lavender help treat both the infection causing the earache and reduce the pain the infection brings on. Used together they do both even more effectively. One method to treat an earache is with a warm compress applied to the ear and cheek.avis claims this treatment both eases the pain and helps stop the infection's spread farther into the ear. In The Complete Guide to Essential Oils & Aromatherapy, Valeria Worwood recommends a different method--add a drop of lavender and a drop of chamomile essential oil to 1 tsp. warm olive oil and mix well.
