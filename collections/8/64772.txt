Moisture-associated skin damage (MASD) is the general term for inflammation or skin erosion caused by prolonged exposure to a source of moisture such as urine, stool, sweat, wound drainage, saliva, or mucus. It is proposed that for MASD to occur, another complicating factor is required in addition to mere moisture exposure.
