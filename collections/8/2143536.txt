Conjunctivitis is easily spread from person to person. The most common cause of conjunctivitis is infection with bacteria or a virus. This often happens when bacteria gets into your eye. This can happen when you touch your eye or wear contact lenses. Allergies are also a common cause of conjunctivitis. The cells in your conjunctiva can react to an allergen.
