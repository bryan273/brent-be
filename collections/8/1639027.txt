A protein only diet takes low-carbohydrate diets a step further by eliminating them all together. This boosts weight loss and forces the body to completely rely on stored fat. This is a difficult diet to follow. Under this plan you do not eat sugary baked goods, breads, pastas, grains, fruits, nuts or alcohol. Instead, you will consume fish, skinless chicken, lean beef, pork and low-fat dairy products.
