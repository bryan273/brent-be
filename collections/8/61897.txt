Best Answer: The mothers will, for the most part, not allow the kittens to feed when they have teeth.. That hurts! And it turns their bellies black and blue with bruises. However, some cats are overbearing and will never wean their kittens on their own. I always like to take the initiative. Don't give the kittens solid food, they will most likely try to swallow it whole and choke on it. Here's what to make to ween kittens.. Get some kitten dry food and kitten wet food and some goat's milk. (If you can't find goat's milk, get a lactose-free milk that is safe for cats. If you can't find either, then just use water.. though they won't be as eager to eat it) Put the milk on the dry food and microwave it until it's soft and mushy.
