Nanny tax, schedule H seems to double tax me. I employ a nanny and have been withholding social-security and medicare from every pay check (6.2% + 1.45% = 7.65%). My understanding is that employer contributes and additional 7.65% too. The Schedule H form is puzzling because in line 2 and 4, we calculate double of social-security and medicare tax (12.4% and 2.9%).
