To qualify as a common cancer for the list, the estimated annual incidence for 2017 had to be 40,000 cases or more. The most common type of cancer on the list is breast cancer, with more than 255,000 new cases expected in the United States in 2017. The next most common cancers are lung cancer and prostate cancer. Because colon and rectal cancers are often referred to as colorectal cancers, these two cancer types are combined for the list. For 2017, the estimated number of new cases of colon cancer and rectal cancer are 95,520 and 39,910, respectively, adding to a total of 135,430 new cases of colorectal cancer.
