Hand tremor is an involuntary muscle movement, trembling, or shaking of the hands. Tremor most accurately refers to a small, rhythmic shaking movement that occurs in a back-and-forth pattern. Everyone has a small, sometimes undetectable, shake when they move their hands. Fatigue, stress, feelings of anger or fear, caffeine, and smoking can make this normal shaking more prominent.
