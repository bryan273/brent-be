A pancreas that is swollen might or might not be an indication of the existence of a condition that is serious. The enlargement, or swelling of the pancreas is most frequently caused by an inflammation of the pancreas which is a condition referred to as pancreatitis. The growth of a tumor also can cause the pancreas to enlarge or swell, but inflammation is much more likely the cause. If a pancreas is swollen from pancreatitis it is more often only a situation that is temporary as this is a problem that frequently takes care or clears up itself. The cause of a swollen and inflamed pancreas has threatening implications.
