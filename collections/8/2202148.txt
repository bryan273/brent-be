There are two main categories of cyanosis: central and peripheral. Central cyanosis causes a bluish colour in the lips, tongue, and skin, especially the fingers and toes. Peripheral cyanosis is seen only in the fingers and toes. Cyanosis caused by congenital heart conditions is often seen soon after birth, but sometimes it does not appear until a baby is older.
