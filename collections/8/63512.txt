In other words, scoliosis may occur at any age. Do you have signs and symptoms indicating that you have developed scoliosis? They may include one shoulder blade more prominent than the other, one side of the rib higher than the other, the body that tilts to one side, and uneven shoulders, waist, hip and legs. Pain is not a typical symptom of scoliosis.
