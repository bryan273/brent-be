Radiation therapy for prostate cancer involves the use of high-energy beams or radioactive seeds to eliminate tumors. The most common types we recommend for prostate cancer include brachytherapy, image-guided radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiosurgery, and proton therapy. Which radiation therapy approach we recommend depends on the unique characteristics of your disease.
