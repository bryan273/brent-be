Using a clean knife, cut the potatoes into 4ths or 6ths. There should be at least. Potatoes cut and dried. Ready for planting. one good “eye” per piece. Now leave the pieces on a tray or screen in the shade or indoors to dry. I recommend a minimum of 1 day but have left them to dry for a couple days without a problem.
