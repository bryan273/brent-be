Whether you write or receive a bounced check — also called a nonsufficient funds, or NSF, check — it will cost you. Write one and you’ll owe your bank an NSF fee of between $27 and $35, and the recipient of the check is permitted to charge a returned-check fee of between $20 and $40 or a percentage of the check amount.
