Juices and soft drinks should be avoided. Eat as tolerated, but only light, bland foods, such as crackers or plain bread to begin with. If your nausea is chronic, you'll need to find a variety of vegetables and proteins that don't upset your stomach to maintain proper nutrition. Stay away from fried or greasy foods.
