Giardia is a protozoal infection. A parasitic, single-celled organism, giardia multiplies in the small intestines of animals. Giardia in veterinary terms is called Giardia Intestinalis or Giardia Duodenalis. This protozoan parasite is common in dogs and is most prevalent in younger canines. Because this infection is known to induce inflammatory bowel disease and can lead to digestion motility disorders, all pets who contract Giardia should be treated by a veterinarian.
