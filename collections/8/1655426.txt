Causes of Swollen Hands and Feet. Swollen hands and feet, also called edema, is caused by buildup of fluid in the body. Dependent extremities such as hands, ankles and feet are prone to swelling, though other parts of the body can also get edema like the abdomen. Reducing the amount of salt intake as well as taking medication can reduce swelling. If the swelling is a result of a disease, you will need to treat the disease separately.
