The most common cause of UTIs are bacteria from the bowel that live on the skin near the rectum or in the vagina, and which can spread and enter the urinary tract through the urethra. 1  Once these bacteria enter the urethra, they travel up, causing infection in the bladder and sometimes other parts of the urinary tract. Sexual intercourse can often lead to UTIs. During sexual activity, bacteria in the vaginal area are sometimes massaged into the urethra.
