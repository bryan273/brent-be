Ovarian cancer risk factors. Age: Two-thirds of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are age 55 or older. Childbearing status: Women who have delivered at least one child, especially before age 30, are at a lower risk for developing the disease. The more children a woman has, the more her ovarian cancer risk declines.
