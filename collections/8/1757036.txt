Eyes: Because of type 1 diabetes, you can develop cataracts and/or retinopathy in your eyes. Retinopathy, or damage to the retina, is much more common than cataracts in type 1 diabetes, but both can cause loss of vision. To avoid eye problems associated with type 1 diabetes, keep your blood glucose under control and have yearly dilated eye check-ups to monitor your eye health.
