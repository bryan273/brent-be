Heartburn is a very common digestive problem linked to acid reflux, a condition where stomach acid and other contents flow backward from the stomach into the esophagus. This causes heartburn symptoms like burning sensations, chest pain, a sour taste in the mouth, and sometimes coughing or gassiness. Risk factors and causes of heartburn include eating a poor diet, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, older age and high levels of inflammation.
