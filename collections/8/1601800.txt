Medication Summary. Only antidepressants that potently inhibit presynaptic reuptake of serotonin appear to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Clomipramine (Anafranil) is the only tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with this quality. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also effective.
