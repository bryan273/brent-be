Memories Light the corners of my mind Misty watercolor memories Of the way we were. Scattered pictures Of the smiles we left behind Smiles we gave to one another For the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then Or has time rewritten every line If we had the chance to do it all again Tell me, would we? Could we?
