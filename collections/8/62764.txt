If no correlation exists between the variables, the points appear randomly scattered on the coordinate plane. If a large correlation exists, the points concentrate near a straight line. Scatter plots are useful data visualization tools for illustrating a trend. If the vertical (or y-axis) variable increases as the horizontal (or x-axis) variable increases, the correlation is positive.
