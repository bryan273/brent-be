A powerhouse antioxidant, vitamin E prevents damage to cell membranes, among other things. Look for a product containing natural vitamin E, which you can identify by its chemical name, d-alpha-tocopherol. The form dl-alpha-tocopherol is synthetic and not nearly as effective. I recommend 400 IU daily.
