Symptoms of a Grass Allergy. An allergy to grass results in allergic rhinitis, or what is otherwise known as hay fever. It can cause symptoms such as breathing problems and asthma, itchy skin or hives, a constant cough and irritated nose, throat and eyes. A grass allergy is the most common type of seasonal allergy and is sometimes confused with a cottonwood pollen allergy.
