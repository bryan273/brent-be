Hepatic herbs for liver can increase liver function and decrease symptoms of a sluggish liver. Some of my favorite hepatic herbs include dandelion root, artichoke leaf and turmeric. Bitter herbs for liver (and foods) can be taken at meals to stimulate digestion, bile production and bile release from the gallbladder. This cascade of events supports liver health as well as optimal digestion. Using a bitters blend such as this one can be a convenient way to have an herbal liver cleanse daily.
