Techopedia explains SAP HANA. SAP HANA is designed to process structured data from relational databases, both SAP and non-SAP, and applications and other systems rapidly. It is capable of using three styles of data replication depending on the source of the data â€“ log-based, ETL-based and trigger-based. The relocated structured data is stored directly in memory. Because of this, data can be accessed quickly in real time by the applications that use HANA.
