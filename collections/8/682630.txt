To steam live lobster: Fill pot so that water comes up sides about two inches. Add 2 tablespoons of salt for each quart of water. If you have sea salt-even better. Bring the water to a rolling boil, add seaweed to keep the lobsters out of the water, and put in lobsters, one at a time. I prefer to use seaweed to a steam rack, (Feel free to use a steaming rack to place the lobsters on or just add directly to the pot.) Bring water to a rolling boil over high heat.
