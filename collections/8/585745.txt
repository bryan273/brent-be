The following are the chief injurious results which may arise from the excessive consumption of sugar in its concentrated form: 1. Acid Dyspepsia. Acidity, or sour stomach, is a very common result of the use of sugar in its ordinary form, or in the form of candy, sweetmeats, etc. Under the action of certain germs, sugar is converted first into alcohol and carbonic acid gas, and later the alcohol is decomposed into acetic acid and water or vinegar. It is in this way that vinegar is made from cider, wine, and other sweet liquids. When taken into the stomach, sugar undergoes this same change.
