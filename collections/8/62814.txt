The band's Wooden Nickel recordings Styx (1972), Styx II (1973), The Serpent Is Rising (1973) and Man of Miracles (1974) were a mixture of straight-ahead rock with some dramatic prog-rock flourishes and art-rock aspirations.These albums showcase intricate and powerful organ, guitar, vocal and percussion solos as well.he band followed DeYoung's lead with their next project, Kilroy Was Here (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the rock opera form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Evert Righteous.
