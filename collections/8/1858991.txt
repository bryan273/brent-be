Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin, Macrodantin) is an antibiotic that is used specifically for urinary tract infections as an alternative to TMP-SMX or a quinolone. Unlike many of the other drugs, however, it is usually taken for 7 - 10 days, even in cases of simple cystitis. It is not useful for treating kidney infections.
