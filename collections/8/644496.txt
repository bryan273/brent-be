A gene is a stretch of DNA that codes for a polypeptide via an RNA chain. These coded chains lead to “traits” in an individual, such as eye color and blood type. A gene is the basic unit of heredity. An allele is a variation of a gene. Genes come in many different forms, or alleles, that lead to the encoding of different RNA chains and, therefore, different traits.
