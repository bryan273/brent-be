What is the difference between psychological and physical dependence? This is a very complicated (although simple) question. Physical dependence on a drug (recreational or not) means the body gets used to the drug, it needs more and more of it to accomplish the same effect. Eventually, the drug is merely used to counteract the withdrawal symptoms that appear when no drugs are being taken.
