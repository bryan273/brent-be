Several other things can also cause knee pain, such as: 1  Bursitis: A bursa is a sac that holds a small amount of fluid thatâ€™s under the skin above your joint. It helps prevent friction when the joint moves. 2  Dislocated kneecap: This means that your kneecap slides out of position, causing knee pain and swelling.
