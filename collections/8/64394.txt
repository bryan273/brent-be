Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. Indoor painting is a year-round pursuit. Interior paint dries best between about 50 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, so avoid painting in extreme temperatures. Warm the crisp cold air of winter with a heater to dry paint faster; you don't need all the windows wide open to eliminate paint fumes.
