Geologists have broken up the Earthâ€™s mantle into layered sections. The outermost layer is called the upper mantle, and goes down to a depth of 410 km. Below that is the the transition zone (660 km), then the lower mantle reaching a depth of 2,891 km. The various layers of the mantle have different types of rocks.
