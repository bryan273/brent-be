Standard Cubic Feet per Minute = SCFM = ft. 3 /minute at standard conditions (1 atm = 14.7psi, 68Â°F ) Why do that? A volumetric flow rate with units of CFM implies that the flow rate was measured at actual conditions (actual pressure, actual temperature). The distinction between SCFM and CFM is important because air density changes with pressure and temperature. This can be seen from taking a look at the ideal gas law.
