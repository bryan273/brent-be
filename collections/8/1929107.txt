Hemorrhage literally means blood bursting forth. Brain hemorrhages are also called cerebral hemorrhages, intracranial hemorrhages, or intracerebral hemorrhages. They account for about 13% of strokes. What Happens During a Brain Hemorrhage? When blood from trauma irritates brain tissues, it causes swelling. This is known as cerebral edema.
