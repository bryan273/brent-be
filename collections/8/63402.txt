In the liquefaction process, the gas is cooled to a temperature of approximately -260 degrees F at ambient pressure. Th e condensed liquid form of natural gas takes up 600 times less space than natural gas. Th e LNG is loaded onto double-hulled ships which are used for both safety and insulating purposes.
