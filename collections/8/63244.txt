In our situation, we owed over $4,000 in to the government due to FICA taxes (15.3%) and withheld income taxes. Obviously, this number would be lower if we didn't withhold income taxes for our nanny, but even if you pay your nanny $20k over the course of the year, that's more than $3,000 of FICA taxes to pay..
