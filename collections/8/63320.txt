The ionic composition of interstitial and intravascular fluids is the same. Proteins, however, are kept with the vascular compartment, at least to a degree, by the vascular wall, which is a semi-permeable membrane. The concentration of proteins is much higher in the plasma sector than in the interstitial sector.
