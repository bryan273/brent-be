At other times my legs feel as though I am walking on one of those plastic blow-up floats (can't remember the word. It's gone. Brain fogged.) on a lake. And yes, my arms get that way, too. Suddenly weak, like all the energy drained out through the ends of my fingers. This happened one time when I was holding my two-year-old grandson.
