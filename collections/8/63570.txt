Controlling Temperature for House Plants. Even tropical plants like cooler air at night than during the day. As a result, healthier growth will be seen if temperatures drop 5째 to 10째F (3째 to 5째C) at night. Night temperatures naturally drop indoors, especially near windows, but you can also turn the thermostat down at night to accentuate the change.
