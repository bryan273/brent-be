Avoid Liquid Food: When you get diagnosed with meningitis, the patients should avoid liquid food. Instead of that food, they should drink the juice of ORS (oral re-hydration salts). The better way on how to treat meningitis naturally is to mix the juice of ORS with the lukewarm water. This is the treatment for the first days.
