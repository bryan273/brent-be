Ed Sheeran recently dropped his newest single, “Don’t”. 2. Ed says the song is “100% true” and is about a girl he was seeing for a bit who spent the night with one of his friends, while they were on the same hotel floor. It’s pretty scandalous and amazing and also possibly about Ellie Goulding and Niall Horan.
