A warm cup of black tea may help to provide relief from a sore throat. Black tea (Camelia sinensis) contains compounds called tannins, which are astringent and may help to shrink swollen tissue. Honey or lemon can be added. Another tea remedy is to make the black tea double-strength and gargle several times a day.
