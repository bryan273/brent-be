Rectal prolapse is an uncommon condition in dogs in which rectal tissue protrudes through the anal opening. It appears as a tubular piece of tissue attached to the anus.The rectum is the part of the large intestine that ends just inside the anus.ogs and cats do not get hemorrhoids so any tissue that protrudes from the anus is abnormal. Try to keep the tissue moist with warm wet washcloths and do not allow your pet to lick or chew at the tissue. Keeping the tissue moist and free of trauma will give it the best chance of being repaired.
