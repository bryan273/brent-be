Wild-caught salmon, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, combines with fresh herbs and cream for a simply but deeply satisfying supper. Complete the meal with a vibrant, pepper arugula salad seasoned with unrefined sea salt and a fruity unrefined extra virgin olive oil. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 2  Pour fresh, heavy cream over salmon filets. 3  Sprinkle fresh dill and thyme over the cream-drenched salmon and bake in an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes or until salmon is firm and flakes easily. 4  Serve immediately.
