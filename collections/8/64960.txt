On 4 July, Oscar Pérez, the helicopter's pilot, reappeared on social media commenting on the flight, protests and potential actions in the future. Pérez began by stating that the attack was planned to only strike fear as a first phase because the group did not consist of murderers, further saying that President Maduro and his fellow government official Diosdado Cabello were the ones who murdered Venezuelans.
