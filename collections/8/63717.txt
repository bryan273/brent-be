Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia or snail fever) is a chronic disease caused by parasitic worms that live in certain types of freshwater snails. Schistosomiasis is second only to malaria as the most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries and is considered one of the most debilitating helminthic diseases among rural populations.
