Blood or protein in the urine may cause false-positive pregnancy results. Urine hCG tests may give a false-negative result if the urine is too diluted or if testing is done too soon in the pregnancy. Certain drugs such as diuretics and promethazine (an antihistamine) may cause false-negative urine results.
