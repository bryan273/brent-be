The enzyme helicase catalyzes the unwinding and the breaking of H-bonds to create a separated section of DNA. The open section is known as a replication bubble and in contains two replication forks. Many different replication bubbles are formed along the DNA structure.NA polymerase enzyme synthesizes a strand of RNA complementary to a section of one of the DNA strands (the template strand). 1. Initiation: A section of DNA known as the promoter (TATA box for eukaryotes) signals where the transcription begins. RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to this site.
