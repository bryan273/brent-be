One such cause of GERD is a hiatal (or hiatus) hernia. This is an anatomical abnormality where a hole in the diaphragm allows the upper part of the stomach to enter the chest cavity, sometimes leading to GERD. Pregnancy is also sometimes a cause of acid reflux due to extra pressure being placed on the internal organs.
