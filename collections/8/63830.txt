Updated July 02, 2017. Employee furloughs are a positive alternative to layoffs, but they have negative consequences, too. Employee furloughs are mandatory time off work with no pay. In a furlough situation, it's critical to enforce the no work rule. Exempt employees who do so much as answer an email are entitled to a full day's pay, so make the rules specific. You may wish to tell employees to leave their devices at the office, or stop your servers from delivering email.
