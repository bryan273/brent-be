Normal Lung Sounds. Normal breath sounds are classified as tracheal, bronchial, and vesicular sounds. The patterns of normal breath sounds are created by the effect of body structures on air moving through airway. Normal lung sounds can be considered abnormal when the sound occurs in an area in which the sounds should not be present.
