The Lifetime Learning credit covers up to $2,000 of undergraduate and graduate school costs. The rules for the Lifetime Learning credit are unchanged from prior years. As before, the credit is 20% of up to $10,000 of qualified education expenses. So the maximum credit for 2014 is $2,000 before any phase-outs.
