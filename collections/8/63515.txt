There are certain genetic conditions, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, that can predispose younger patients to developing COPD. If you develop symptoms of COPD at a very young age, typically under 40 years of age, your physician may screen for this condition. The progression of the disease can vary slightly, so itâ€™s more important to focus on possible COPD symptoms rather than solely on the age you might get it.
