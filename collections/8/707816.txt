Leg swelling can occur in any part of the legs, including the feet, ankles, calves and thighs. Leg swelling can result either from fluid buildup (fluid retention) or from inflammation in injured or diseased tissues or joints. Many of the causes of leg swelling, such as an injury or prolonged standing or sitting, are easily identified.
