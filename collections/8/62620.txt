The Cost of Laser Scar Removal. The cost of laser scar removal is determined according to anesthesia fees, facility fees and physician fees. Since laser scar removal is often performed during a chemical peel or other procedure, anesthesia and facility fees can be combined. Because of the wide range of scar issues, the potential for repeated treatments per scar, and combination of treatments that may be necessary, there is no way to estimate cost before you consult a surgeon. Ask your doctor for a cost estimate after your examination.
