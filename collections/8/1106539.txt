There are a number of essential oils that can be helpful to relieve inflammation. A teaspoon of wintergreen is the equivalent of almost twenty-two adult aspirin. Oregano has been shown to reduce inflammation by 94%. Myrrh oil is rated as the second best anti-inflammatory essential oil. Frankincense resin is the best treatment for arthritis. These oils can be mixed with neutral oils such as grape seed oil or olive oil and be applied directly to part of the body suffering from inflammation. They can also be used in diffusers for a constant stream of low levels of oils into the brain and body as a whole.
