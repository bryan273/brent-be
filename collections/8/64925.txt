For the unit alone, an electric tankless water heater costs from $595 to $1,530 and a gas tankless water heater costs $1,005 to $1,770, according to Bluebook International. However, because of the prolonged and complicated installation process, expect to add several hundred to a couple thousand dollars more in installation costs.
