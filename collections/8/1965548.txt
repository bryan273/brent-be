Bedbugs are a common cause of night-time itching. These microscopic, blood-feeding insects infest mattresses, laying their eggs and feeding off dead skin cells. They are active at night, and feed on their human hosts, leaving behind skin lesions which look like mosquito bites. The scabies rash is another cause for itching during the night. Scabies are a parasite that burrow in the skin and lay eggs which then hatch and continue the cycle. They are very contagious and are invisible. Treatment is with a pesticide cream through perscription such as elimite that contains permethrin.
