If your child has a rash and the doctor suspects scarlet fever, he or she will usually take a throat culture (a painless swab of throat secretions) to see if the bacteria grow in the laboratory. If a strep infection is confirmed, the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic for your child to be taken for about 10 days.
