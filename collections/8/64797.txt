ROBLOX was started by David Baszucki and Erick Cassel in 2005 at Silicon Valley, California. It was believed that ROBLOX started out as a concept in 1999, but was not created due to the unavailable technology at the time. The name ROBLOX is a portmanteau of “Robot” and “Blocks”. The first ever game level to be created was Crossroads, a 2,000 block large playground-like area, where players can fight each other in what is known as a “brick battle”.
