Foot Bursitis Symptoms. The most recognizable sign of foot bursitis is swelling caused by the enlargement of the bursa. This swelling is the build up of excess fluid in the bursa. When you suffer from bursitis you will usually feel pain in the area of the inflamed bursa. If tendonitis is also present, the pain can radiate away from the bursa.
