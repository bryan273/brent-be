When your right eye twitches it means something good is going to happen. I have heard, when the top of your eye (say the eyelid) is twitching, something good is going to happen to you, but when the bottom of your eye is twitching, something bad is going to happen. If it is twitching really bad, the effectiveness is stronger than a little twitch. + 172 others found this useful.
