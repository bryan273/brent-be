Potatoes come in 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pound bags. Depending on where you live and what size bag you buy, you can expect to pay between 15 and 60 cents a pound. The more you buy, the cheaper they are. So, for a 3 pound bag of potataoes, expect to pay a little less than $2. For a 50 pound bag, a good average price is around $7.50. Jomarie Raptis.
