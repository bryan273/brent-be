Numbness in fingers is often the side effect of an injury, but some medical conditions, such as arthritis and radiculopathy, can also contribute to this side effect. It can be difficult to narrow down what is causing numbness in the fingers, as this can be the result of several different conditions. Damage to the circulatory system, nerves or muscles throughout the arm can cause the fingers to become numb or develop a tingling sensation.
