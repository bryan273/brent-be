Syncope causes collapse, which may last from seconds to minutes. Most fainting spells are due to low blood pressure or lack of oxygen delivery to the brain. Syncope is a symptom not a disease and can be caused by a wide number of disorders. During a fainting episode of syncope a dog will collapse usually on one side. The limbs may become stiff or he/she may paddle his/her legs just like with a seizure.
