All propane tanks have a tare weight or T.W. stamped on the collar of the tank. For a grill sized tank you simply calculate the tare weight + 20 lbs, and that's how much the tank should weigh when it's full. Most 20 lb tanks have a tare weight of +/- 17 pounds when completely empty. This means a full propane tank should weigh about 37 pounds. There is also a month and year on the collar indicating the date the tank was made.
