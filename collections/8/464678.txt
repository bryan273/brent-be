Cefaclor is used for treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms including H influenzae and for treatment of otitis media, sinusitis, and infections involving the respiratory tract. It may not be appropriate in acute sinusitis, owing to less activity and the potential for severe allergic reactions.
