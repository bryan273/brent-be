The use of the word yard (Middle English: ȝerd or ȝerde) to describe this length is first attested in Langland's poem on Piers Plowman. The usage seems to derive from the prototype standard rods held by the king and his magistrates . The word yard is a homonym of yard in the sense of an enclosed area of land.
