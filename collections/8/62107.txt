I haven't had a real job in 5 1/2 years, so the movie deal was very, very good to me, Reidy said. In the movie, called Love and Other Drugs, Jamie is played by Jake Gyllenhall and the girlfriend by Anne Hathaway. It was hard to miss the promotional blitz this past week. From Jimmy Fallon to Jay Leno, the Today Show, the cover of Entertainment Weekly and Vogue, where Reidy is mentioned on page 200.
