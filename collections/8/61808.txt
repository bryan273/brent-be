Lalit Pandey, Doing R&D on Macbook, iPhone and iPad for a while. Views. The iPhone has a temperature sensor that blocks down all the functions in the iPhone once it reaches a temperature higher than 45 degrees. The value can be high but as far as I can remember, its 45. If your question is regarding the use of iPhone to measure the temperature, I fiddled around to find such an app a while ago but I couln't get one.
