Scientists break the mantle into two pieces. They have the upper mantle and the lower mantle. There are very small differences between the two layers. The upper mantle has Olivine (a very special rock), compounds with silicon dioxide, and a substance called Peridotite. The lower mantle is more solid than the upper mantle.
