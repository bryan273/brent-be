Types of cataracts include: 1  A subcapsular cataract occurs at the back of the lens. 2  A nuclear cataract forms deep in the central zone (nucleus) of the lens. 3  A cortical cataract is characterized by white, wedge-like opacities that start in the periphery of the lens and work their way to the center in a spoke-like fashion.
