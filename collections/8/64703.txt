There was a Blossom reunion. Repeat, the cast of Blossom reunited! The show, which ran for five seasons on NBC from 1991-1995, is returning to the airwaves on The Hub Network. To celebrate, the cast got together to host a marathon. Mayim Bialik, who played the titular hat-loving character, shared photos from the shoot on her social media pages.
