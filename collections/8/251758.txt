Amiloride and triamterene interfere with the sodium-potassium exchange at the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Spironolactone acts as an aldosterone antagonist. Aldosterone promotes sodium and water retention. By blocking the actions of aldosterone, spironolactone prevents increases in fluid volume.
