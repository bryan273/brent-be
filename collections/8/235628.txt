What is blood in the urine? Sometimes blood in the urine can be seen, but at other times it is present in such small quantities that it is not visible to the naked eye. A simple test can detect even tiny amounts of blood; it is a routine test, carried out at many medical examinations. Blood in the urine has various possible causes: 1. Urinary infection (cystitis) This is much the most common cause, particularly in young women. If the red urine coincides with symptoms of cystitis and disappears in a few days when the infection is treated, it is usually attributed to infection and no further tests are carried out. The other symptoms of cystitis are: 1  burning feeling on passing water. 2  feeling the need to pass urine more often. 3  feeling that the bladder has not been emptied. 4  sometimes a fever and feeling unwell.
