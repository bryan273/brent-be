An injury to the nerves in the arm, neck, shoulder, or even the back can cause a numbness sensation to set in the right arm. Injury can include compression of the blood vessels, an infection, or tissue scarring. Incidents such as frostbite, a herniated disk, or an animal bite may cause damage to the right arm.
