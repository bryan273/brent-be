COPD is the third-leading cause of death in the United States, preceded by only heart disease and cancer. It kills over 126,000 Americans annually. Historically, COPD has occurred more frequently in men; however, since 2000, more women have died each year from the disease than men. To date, COPD remains a growing healthcare concern for women in many countries. See COPD in Women. COPD predominantly occurs in people over 40 years of age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 15 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD as of 2011.
