Users are always on the lookout for new anonymous tools, though. And since the collapse of a service that allowed people to shame Instagram users anonymously, an anonymous texting tool — Truth — has emerged. Truth is an iOS app that allows users to anonymously send text messages to their contacts. After sending a message, the other party can respond, but to an owl avatar to maintain anonymity. The app was originally going to launch with the name Secret, but they were beat to the punch, according to VentureBeat.
