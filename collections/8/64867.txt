ZAMAC is an acronym for the Zinc, Aluminum, Magnesium, and Copper alloy that die-cast cars are made from. The term ZAMAC is also used for an unpainted car, and or base. ZAMAC cars have been popular among collectors for some time. In 2004, almost half of the 100 First Editions were released with the ZAMAC look--clear coat over the bare metal. This was done intentionally. The first few were released in the vending machines at a 2004 convention.
