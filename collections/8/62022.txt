I find resort fees horrible!! It is another way for hotels to quote out deceptively low prices that does not include the resort fees. The resort fees seem to be buried in the fine print. I do not bid on PL for that reason. The last time I bid on PL for Vegas was in 2000-2002 when they had the $20/night bonus for AMEX.
