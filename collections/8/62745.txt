Diocletian's original given name was Διοκληϛ (Diocles), which is a very common Greek first name. The meaning of the name is uncertain, but διοικεω means to rule and the first part of the word (DIO) has the sense of a god or a lord. Your guess is not completely off base, however, because words for two are similar.
