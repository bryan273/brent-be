Some drainage or crusting of the lids, especially in the morning, may be normal. Clear or watery drainage from the eye is often due to allergies or a virus. The eyes may also be itchy and red and feel scratchy. Colds, flu, and viral pinkeye (conjunctivitis) also can cause watery eyes and a runny nose. It is very common for pinkeye drainage to cause the eyelids to stick together during sleep.
