What's in this article? Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in kids. They happen when bacteria (germs) get into the bladder or kidneys. A baby with a UTI may have a fever, throw up, or be fussy. Older kids may have a fever, have pain when peeing, need to pee a lot, or have lower belly pain. Kids with UTIs need to see a doctor.
