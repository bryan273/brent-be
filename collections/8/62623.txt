The typical cost will roughly range from $600 to $700 per scar â€“ respectively vary on the size and the location of the scar. Surgical excision can be a choice too. Some avoids removal of keloid scar through excision as it gives the probability of worsening the keloid scar, which in other cases turns keloid scar in much larger size of the excision.
