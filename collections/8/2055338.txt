Syncope in dogs can be a symptom of serious underlying illness. The term syncope, pronounced SIN-co-pee, means the same when applied to dogs and humans -- fainting. It's not a medical condition in itself but can be a symptom of underlying disease that causes a temporary reduction in blood flow, and thus oxygen delivery, to the brain.
