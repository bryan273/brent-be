Calories are basically energy, and energy equates to pounds.. To lose weight safely, you should try to eat 500 to 1,000 fewer calories than usual. One pound equals roughly 3,500 calories. So, if you eat 500 fewer calories each day, you should lose one pound by week's end. Burning calories through exercise has the same effect. So by combining reducing calories with moderate exercise, you should be able to drop 1 to 2 pounds per week. Going much lower on your calorie count can be dangerous.
