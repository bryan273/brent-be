Umbilical hernias are common in newborns and infants younger than 6 months. They occur when part of the intestines bulge through the abdominal wall next to the belly button. In babies with umbilical hernias, parents may see bulging around the belly button area when the baby cries. Unlike other types of hernias, umbilical hernias may heal on their own, usually by the time a baby is 1 year old. If not, surgery can repair the hernia.
