Things You'll Need. Keep in mind that irritations and even small infections are a normal part of the healing process. Nose piercings frequently take as long as eight months to heal, and in some cases can take even longer. During that time, you will have to deal with oozing, redness, swelling and discomfort. Use proper piercing care. Get your nose professionally pierced with clean equipment and use a nonreactive metal such as surgical steel or titanium. Clean the piercing site twice a day with mild soap, and soak it in warm salt water to bring down the swelling. Take preventive measures to keep your nose clean.
