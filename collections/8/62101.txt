Approximate cost to convert tub to walk in shower? etab35July 6, 2015. We have a smallish, dark guest bath I'd love to upgrade. We plan to keep the existing vanity, but replace the tile, sink, and toilet. The tub is almond color, as is the bath tile. To update, we'd need to replace the tub and tile as well.
