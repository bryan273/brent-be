How do pressure sores happen? Too much pressure on the skin for too long, as in sitting or lying too long in one position. Unrelieved pressure is the most common cause of pressure sores in SCI. The extended pressure cuts off the blood supply to the skin, leading to tissue damage, skin breakdown and a pressure sore.
