In these circumstances we make a charge of Â£10 for a private sickness certificate. To continue to claim Statutory Sick Pay after the first week of illness you will need a doctor's certificate, which will be provided free of charge.ll employers must comply with these regulations. You only need a doctor's certificate during the first seven days of illness if you wish to claim benefits other than Statutory Sick Pay, for example, benefits under a private insurance scheme, or to take your pre-booked holiday as sick leave instead.
