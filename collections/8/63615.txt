Cons: 1  Good chance of getting a false-negative. 2  Feelings of disappointment if you get a negative result. 3  Loss of cash (Tests cost $1 to $18 per test) 4  If positive, possibility of detecting an early miscarriage you may have missed if you hadnâ€™t tested early. 5  Not accurate with hCG trigger shots such as Ovidrel.
