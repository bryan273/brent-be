Since lower back pain is often due to an injury such as trauma from pulled or torn tissue, it is likely that the trauma would occur on one side or the other. If you helped a friend move a couch, for example, and had to twist in an unnatural way, you could pull or tear a muscle in the lower right side of your back.
