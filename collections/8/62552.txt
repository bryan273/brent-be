Calcium Chloride currently holds the record for melting ice at the coldest temperatures. While potassium chloride can melt ice down to approximately -13°F (-25°C) and rock salt down to -10°F (-23.3°C), Calcium Chloride can melt down to -25°F(-31.7°C). This makes Calcium Chloride ice melt the most effective ice melter during harsh winter conditions and heavy snowstorms.
