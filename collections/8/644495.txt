The term ‘Gene’ is lately evolved with the development of Genetics. Gene is a segment of DNA, which contains instructions to form proteins. Each gene has a specific sequence of base pairs, which determines the structure and function of a specific protein. Genes are the blueprints of all the traits in the body.
