Surgical intervention may be required for very severe cases of neck osteoarthritis. The procedures may involve removal of bone, osteophytes (bone spurs), or disc tissue which is compressing nerves of the spinal cord. Cervical fusion, or fusing the discs in the cervical region of the spine, may help stabilize the neck.
