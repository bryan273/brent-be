Symptoms of stomach cancer range from blood in the stool to abdominal pain. Often, however, stomach cancer does not have symptoms in the early stages, or they can be vague and nonspecific -- such as nausea or weight loss. Also, there is no single symptom that exactly pinpoints stomach cancer; therefore, further evaluation and testing is required for a diagnosis.
