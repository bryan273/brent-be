A urinary tract infection (also called a “UTI”) is what happens when bacteria (germs) get into the urinary system and multiply. The result is redness, swelling, and pain. If the infection is not treated promptly, the bacteria can travel up to the kidneys and cause a more serious type of infection, called pyelonephritis.
