Abnormalities of blood clotting, usually inherited (e.g. haemophilia), can cause blood in the urine which is usually painless. Only a few patients with blood in the urine will have bleeding disorders but identifying them is important since bleeding can occur elsewhere and is usually preventable by treatment.
