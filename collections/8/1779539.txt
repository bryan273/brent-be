is situated. The liver is a large reddish brown solid organ that sits in the upper part of the abdomen, tucked away under the right side of the rib cage. Above it is the heart and the right lung, and it is separated from them by a thin sheet of muscle called the diaphragm.ile made in the liver flows out through this bile duct (which is a thin tube the size of a drinking straw), and goes down to the gut, where it mixes with food. The gall bladder is a small greenish pear-shaped bag that hangs off the bile duct.
