Although type 1 diabetes is not an inherited disease, there is some genetic factor. A first-degree relative (sister, brother, son, daughter) of someone with type 1 diabetes has about a 6 in 100 chance of developing type 1 diabetes. This is higher than the chance of the general population, which is about 1 in 300.his is because in type 2 diabetes you still make insulin (unlike type 1 diabetes). However, you either do not make enough for your body's needs, and/or the cells in your body are not able to use insulin properly. This is called insulin resistance.
