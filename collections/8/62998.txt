How to Determine What Size Air Compressor and SCFM Air Tools Require. Even the smallest compressor can provide 60 and 90 PSI of pressure needed to run an air tool (check the toolâ€™s manual for specific recommendations). However, most tools require a great volume of air to run at peak performance: Anywhere from 4 to 5 SCFM up to 15 to 20 SCFM or more. In contrast, a nail gun requires only about 2.2 SCFM to operate.
