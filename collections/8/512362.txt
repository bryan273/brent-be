Fruits and Vegetables. If you have ulcers, eat fruits that are low in acid, such as apples, peaches, pears, grapes, kiwifruit, bananas, berries and melons. Avoid all citrus, as high-acid oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons and limes may increase stomach acids. Consume vegetables that do not cause you pain, discomfort or excess gas.
