Puberty Breast Development. Breast development is an early sign of puberty in girls. This can happen before age 9 in some girls, but later in others. If you are self-conscious, you might want to start wearing a training bra, which is a soft bra with no real support. Talk to your mom, older sister, or an aunt about buying a training bra.
