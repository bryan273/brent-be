, Veterinarian, writer. The common cause of black crusting around the eyes is low-grade conjunctivitis. This can be precipitated by catflu, allergies, catflu, foreign bodies, dust, etc. Catflu is often low-grade in cats and causes a mild, persistent conjunctivitis with epiphora (tears) and intermittent sneezing. See your vet if problem persists.
