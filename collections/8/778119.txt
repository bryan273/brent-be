I pass this heat treatment definition along until I'm corrected or find a more succinct, better one. Heat treatment is the controlled heating and cooling of a metal in order to change its properties. Forging is controlled heating and cooling but is not considered a heat treatment by metallurgists, probably because of the plastic deformation involved.
