Myositis is the medical term for inflammation of the skeletal muscle. The inflammation may vary in severity and may be isolated to one muscle, muscle group or several muscles throughout the body. The key features of muscle inflammation are swelling, pain and disruption of normal function (muscle weakness). Myositis may be due to various causes, both acute and chronic mechanisms that can cause mild discomfort of the area and muscle weakness to severe debilitating pain and complete loss of muscle function.
