The most common cause of small bumps on the palms of the hands is something called dyshidrotic eczema. In this condition, the skin on the palms (or the soles of the feet) becomes irritated, and the initial symptoms are small firm blisters under the skin, about the size of a pinhead, which may be either whitish or clear in appearance.
