Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually recommended as the first treatment for gout. They work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack. NSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib. If you've been prescribed NSAIDs, it's a good idea to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards.
