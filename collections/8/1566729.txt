lung surfactant, a detergent-like agent that reduces the surface tension of the liquid film covering the inner lining of the pulmonary alveoli. As an alveolus becomes smaller during expiration, the surfactant becomes more concentrated, further reducing the surface tension and preventing alveolar collapse.
