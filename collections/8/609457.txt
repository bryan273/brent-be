Gargle with apple cider vinegar. ACV is the best thing to use for strep but to really kill strep you need to sip it (and swallow it) several times throughout the day. An organic brand with the mother is best. I use Bragg brand. I drank ACV once when I was having a gallbladder attack and I was throwing up for the next couple of hours.
