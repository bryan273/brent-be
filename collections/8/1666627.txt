An infection is the most likely cause of swollen lymph nodes in the groin. When lymph nodes swell due to infection, it is usually related to the area of the body where the lymph node is located. In the case of the groin area, the infection might be linked to the genitals, the feet, or the legs. Sexually transmitted diseases are types of infections that can cause groin lymph node swelling, but other infections that are not sexually transmitted might also cause this to occur.
