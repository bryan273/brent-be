The wisdom teeth are located on the top and bottom of the mouth, at the very back, and are the third molar from the front. These teeth are called wisdom teeth because they generally emerge when the patient is 17 to 21 years of age, or old enough to have a certain amount of wisdom. While many patients must have their wisdom teeth removed, due to poor alignment or not enough room in the mouth, some wisdom teeth develop properly and do not need to be extracted.
