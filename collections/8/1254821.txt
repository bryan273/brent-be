This is especially true with migraine headaches. Head pain can be classified as being one of three types: 1) primary headache, 2) secondary headache, and 3) cranial neuralgias, facial pain, and other headaches. Common primary headaches include tension, migraine, and cluster headaches. Home remedies for tension headaches, the most common type of primary headache, include rest and over-the-counter (OTC) medications for pain. Secondary headaches are usually a symptom of an injury or an underlying illness.
