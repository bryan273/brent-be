If the mother cat is still present, but her milk supply is inadequate or if there is some other problem you can speed up the weaning process by mixing cat replacement formula with some solid kitten food. Kittens can start eating solid food when they are very young. Kittens start getting their teeth between 2-4 weeks of age and so you should start giving them small amounts of solid food when they are 3 weeks old.
