Since the seizure begins in a specific part of the brain, it is usually cause by an undiagnosed illness or injury. Unlike generalized seizures, during a partial seizure the dog remains conscious. The main area affected is the part of the brain where the seizure is taking place. Other areas of the body may also be affected. A sign of partial seizure is the twitching of the face, which most commonly takes place on one side. Other parts of the body may show slight movements or twitches as well. Another type of partial seizures is called a complex partial seizure.
