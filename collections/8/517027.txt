Elbow pain is often caused by overuse. Many sports, hobbies and jobs require repetitive hand, wrist or arm movements. Elbow pain may occasionally be due to arthritis, but in general, your elbow joint is much less prone to wear-and-tear damage than are many other joints. Common causes of elbow pain include: Broken arm. Bursitis. Dislocated elbow. Golfer's elbow. Osteoarthritis. Osteochondritis dissecans. Rheumatoid arthritis.
