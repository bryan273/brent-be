How do you decide when to resist and when the right time to take a test is? The Best Time to Take a Pregnancy Test. The best time to take a pregnancy test is after your period is late. This will help you avoid false negatives and the false positives of very early miscarriages. If you're not already keeping a fertility calendar, proper pregnancy test timing is a good reason to start one. If your cycles are irregular or you don’t chart your cycles, don't take a test until you’ve passed the longest menstrual cycle you usually have. For example, if your cycles range from 30 to 36 days, the best time to take a test would be day 37 or later.
