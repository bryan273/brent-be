Just as in DNA replication, the enzyme reads the template strand in a 3’→5’ direction, while building the new RNA strand in a 5’→3’ direction. Again, two of the phosphate groups are removed as a new phosphodiester bond is formed, connecting the nucleotide to the chain.NA polymerase enzyme synthesizes a strand of RNA complementary to a section of one of the DNA strands (the template strand). 1. Initiation: A section of DNA known as the promoter (TATA box for eukaryotes) signals where the transcription begins. RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to this site.
