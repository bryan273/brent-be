When wisdom teeth emerge, they break through the gums, causing a flap of tissue to grow over them. Food can become trapped in this flap and a serious infection can occur, resulting in the necessary surgical procedure. In addition, wisdom teeth must be extracted if they grow in crooked or face the wrong direction.
