What is mineral oil? Mineral oil is a lubricant laxative that works by coating the waste matter inside your intestines to help seal in water. When too much water seeps out of your stools they can become hard and cause constipation. Mineral oil rectal (applied in the rectum) is used to treat constipation. Mineral oil is sometimes used to remove barium residue from your colon after you have undergone a CT scan or other radiologic (x-ray) examination of your intestines. Mineral oil may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
