In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium move perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. Transverse waves are characterized by peaks and valleys, called crests and troughs. In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium move parallel to the wave's direction of travel. This type of wave is characterized by areas of high and low densities in the medium, called compressions and rarefactions.
