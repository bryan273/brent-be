Home. Immigration Watch Canada is an organization of Canadians who believe that immigration has to serve the interests of its own citizens. It cannot be turned into a social assistance / job-finding program for people from other countries.. Number of immigrants coming to Canada --- an average of close to 250,000 per year since 1991. That's 684 per day and 28 per hour. This unnecessary and relentless intake is an abnormality in Canada's immigration history.
