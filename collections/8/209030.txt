Herpes simplex eye infections are eye infections caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which can also cause cold sores on your mouth or face. The herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) usually causes genital herpes and rarely causes eye infections. Nearly everyone is exposed to the virus during childhood.
