Another kitchen item that can be used to treat peeling fingertips is oats. This remedy will effectively remove dead skin cells from your fingers and make them soft and smooth. Mix a handful of powdered oats in a large bowl of warm water. Soak your fingers in it for 10 to 15 minutes. Wash your hands with clean water and pat dry gently using a soft cotton towel.
