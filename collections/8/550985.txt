For moderate drinkers, alcohol does not suppress food intake, and may actually increase appetite. Chronic alcohol consumption appears to have the opposite effect. Alcohol causes euphoria, which depresses appetite, so that heavy drinkers tend to eat poorly and become malnourished. Alcohol is very rich in energy, packing 7 calories per gram. But like pure sugar or fat, the calories are void of nutrients.
