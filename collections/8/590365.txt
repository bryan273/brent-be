Without treatment, constrictive pericarditis can lead to a range of complications including: irregular heartbeat (heart arrhythmia) heart failure; liver damage. Post-heart attack pericarditis. While pericarditis doesnâ€™t cause or contribute to heart attack, the injury to cardiac tissue caused by a heart attack can sometimes lead to pericarditis. This is known as post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) pericarditis.
