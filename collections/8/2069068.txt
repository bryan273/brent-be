Two major viral infectious agents that cause cat sneezing are feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus. Both present with similar symptoms, sneezing accompanied by discharge from the eyes and nose. The feline calicivirus may also bring with it fever and ulcerous lesions in a cat’s mouth or on a cat’s tongue.
