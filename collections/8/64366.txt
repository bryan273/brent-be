We believe Canada should have some immigration, but that immigration levels should be reduced to about 25,000, that is, to about 10% of the current annual 250,000 intake.. Number of immigrants coming to Canada --- an average of close to 250,000 per year since 1991. That's 684 per day and 28 per hour. This unnecessary and relentless intake is an abnormality in Canada's immigration history.
