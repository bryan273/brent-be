There are many causes of eye discharge, ranging from infections to allergic reactions to eye injury. Irritation of the eyes is a frequent cause of watery eye discharge. Allergic reactions can cause itchy, watery eyes. Both allergies and infections cause pinkeye, or conjunctivitis. Eye discharge associated with infections is usually accompanied by other symptoms including redness (bloodshot appearance), burning, blurred vision, or eye pain. Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be associated with eye infections.
