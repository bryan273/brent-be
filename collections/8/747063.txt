What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Atrial Fibrillation? Atrial fibrillation (AF) usually causes the heart's lower chambers, the ventricles, to contract faster than normal. When this happens, the ventricles can't completely fill with blood. Thus, they may not be able to pump enough blood to the lungs and body. This can lead to signs and symptoms, such as: 1  Palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or fast) 2  Shortness of breath. 3  Weakness or problems exercising.  Chest 1  pain. Dizziness or fainting.  Fatigue 1  (tiredness) Confusion.
