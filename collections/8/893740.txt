1 Having a roofing contractor remove (and dispose of) old roofing materials, then install asphalt shingles runs about $1-$4 a square foot, or a total of $1,700-$8,400 for a typical ranch-style home (1,700-2,100 square foot, gently sloping roof). Do-it-yourself materials run around $680-$3,700 for a typical one-story ranch-style home with a 1,700-2,100-square-foot, gently-sloping roof. 2  Standard gray asphalt shingles in a three-tab rectangle are the least expensive; expect to pay more for higher-end colors and styles.
