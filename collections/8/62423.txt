Marilyn Savant has the highest I.Q ever recorded, so far, as a child her I.Q was 228 but now it has dropped down to 186, THATS STILL REALLY BIG THOUGH..........smarty pants â€¦ Hers (and everyone's) drop on new tests because they continually renormalize the test scoring so that population average IQ (supposed normal) stays at 100.
