Secondary hyperthyroidism is characterized by elevated levels of TSH, freeT4 and/or free T3 levels. If the free T4 level is normal but symptoms of hyperthyroidism are present along with a suppressed TSH, T3 toxicosis should be considered and a serum free T3 level should be determined if not ordered initially.
