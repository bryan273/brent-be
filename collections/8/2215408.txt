Other causes could be a â€‹kidney stone or urinary tract infection. In women, the vagina may be the source of blood believed to come from the urinary tract. Women can also have a kidney, bladder, or ureteral stone, which can cause blood in the urine. In either gender, bloody urine that originates in the lower urinary tract (the bladder in particular) and does not have signs of infection is often a symptom of bladder cancer. Blood in the urine that originates in the kidney, also without infection, is a common sign of kidney cancer.
