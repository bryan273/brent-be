Your back molars, also known as wisdom teeth, are the last adult teeth to emerge in your mouth. They come in on the top and bottom of both sides, usually between the ages of 17 and 21. Many people donâ€™t have enough room in their jaws to accommodate wisdom teeth without their other teeth shifting. This can lead to a variety of problems.
