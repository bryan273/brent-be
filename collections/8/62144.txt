MALAGA’S residents are all smiles as new statistics reveal the southern city is the best place to live in Spain. Europe-wide research found the people of Malaga were happier than those living in Oviedo or the world-renowned cities of Madrid and Barcelona. COMMENTS. “Satisfied” is not necessarily happy. I prefer Malaga to Madrid and Barcelona and have lived in both these cities. Malaga has a charm all of its own, but this report does not measure happiness. Fact is, people in Madrid are just as happy as people in Malaga, or London, or Paris.
