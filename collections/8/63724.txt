Add this, along with the pod, to your liquid and steep. The pods can then be removed, rinsed, dried, and placed in granulated white sugar to produce what is called vanilla sugar. Vanilla sugar is when a vanilla bean has been added to white granulated sugar or confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar. The bean is cut in half and buried in the sugar, covered, and left for a week or two to allow the vanilla to permeate through the sugar.
