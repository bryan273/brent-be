Structure. The nervous system is divided into two parts: 1  the central nervous system consisting of the brain and spinal cord. 2  These structures are protected by bone and cushioned from injury by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 3  the peripheral system which connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body. Sensory nerves gather information from inside the body and the outside environment. 2  The nerves then carry the information to central nervous system (CNS). 3  Sensory information brought to the CNS is processed and interpreted. 4  Motor nerves convey information from the CNS to the muscles and the glands of the body.
