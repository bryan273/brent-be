Causes and Risk Factors. A collapsed lung is often the result of pressure on an airway from outside - a swollen lymph node or fluid between the lining of the lungs and the chest wall, for example - can also cause a lung to collapse. When the airway is blocked, the blood absorbs the air inside the air sacs (alveoli).
