Best Answer: Nsf fees are usually bank fees. Maybe you have something that was trying to be automatically withddrawn from you account and u didn't have the means, then the bank could have charged you for that. Call them and see. NSF Charge is Non Sufficient Funds. There may be something in the rules on the account which you signed when you opened the account that states the bank will charge you a NSF fee if your balance falls below a certain level. It is a totally bogus charge in my opinion and just a way to get money for the banks' bottom line profit.
