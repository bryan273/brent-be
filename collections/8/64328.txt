Magnesium is a mineral that stabilizes adenosine triphosphate, which is the energy source that fuels muscular contraction. Feeling weak, cramps and muscle twitches are signs of magnesium deficiency. Increase your intake by eating beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, whole grains, bananas and dark, leafy greens.
