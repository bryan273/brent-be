If this is the case, you may be permitted to remain in your home for an indefinite length of time. In fact, you might be able to miss 10 or more mortgage payments before finally losing your home. If your foreclosure is delayed for a significant amount of time, you may be able to use the situation to your advantage. If you can make a large payment that brings your home out of delinquency, your lender may choose not to foreclose on your home after all.
