What are the similarities between the nervous system and the endocrine system? Both the nervous system and endocrine system are devoted to maintaining homeostasis by coordinating and regulating the activities of other cells, tissues, organs, and systems. Both systems are regulated by negative feedback mechanisms. Chemical messengers are important in both systems, although their method of transmission and release differs in the two systems.
