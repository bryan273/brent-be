Wisdom teeth are kinda unique from person to person. Some people they come in just fine over a matter of a few weeks sometime in their teens (or later). Some people just never get them. Others they come in sideways. And for some like you, they seem to take forever to come in, and maybe never will fully emerge. Give it a few more weeks. Teeth do grow in slowly and wisdom teeth are good big ones. If you really think that its taking too long go back and see your dentist in a couple of weeks. Good luck.
