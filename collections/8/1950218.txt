Introduction The following article is a follow-up to Industry Study Indicates Stress Corrosion Cracking in Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Vessels, which appeared in the October 1988 BULLETIN.he tests showed that some inorganic amines and ethylenediamide inhibited cracking in air-contaminated ammonia. Because the molecular constitution of hydrazine (N2H4) is similar to that of ammonia (NH3), this compound was subjected to further tests at concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 1.0 percent.
