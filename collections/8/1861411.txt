Common Questions and Answers about Tramadol for anxiety. I wanted to get off Tramadol so I quit taking it 4 days ago and am having horrible anxiety, insomnia and having a hard time forcing fluids. Although I'm a nurse, I want someone to take care of me now! I was taking two 50mg Tramadol three times a day for a year and a half. I am seeing my PCP this Tuesday and was wondering what I can ask her about helping me these horrible unrelenting anxiety attacks and what is there that I can take for this daily chr pain that is not addictive.
