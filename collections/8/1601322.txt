Esophagitis is any inflammation or irritation of the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that sends food from your throat down to your stomach. Common causes include acid reflux, side effects of certain medications, and bacterial or viral infections. Reflux is when the stomach contents and acids back up into the esophagus. This disorder can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including trouble swallowing, sore throat, and heartburn. Untreated esophagitis can lead to ulcers or even to a severe narrowing of the esophagus, which can be a medical emergency.
