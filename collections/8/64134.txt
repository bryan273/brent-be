Often, direct flights are less expensive than nonstop flights– but not always. If you have a choice between a direct or a nonstop and the price is the same, take the nonstop! Connecting: A connecting flight will take at least two different planes with two different flight numbers to reach your final destination.irect: While a direct flight might sound like a nonstop flight, it’s not. A direct flight makes at least one intermediate stop along the way to its final destination, but has only one flight number. For example, if you choose a direct flight between Atlanta and San Francisco you’d fly on one plane the whole way to SFO.
