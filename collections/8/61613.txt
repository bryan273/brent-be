In our example, the result is 30/40, or 75%. The age 62 Social Security benefit is multiplied by the fraction derived above. In our example, 75% of $1200 is $900. The Special Retirement Supplement will be $900 a month and will not receive a cost of living adjustment. The computation for a Special Category Employee would be done in a similar fashion. Letâ€™s say a law enforcement employee retires at age 49 with 25 years of FERS civilian service and the same estimated age 62 Social Security benefit of $1200. Their SRS would be $750. SCEs are allowed to receive their Special Retirement Supplement at an age earlier than regular employees.
