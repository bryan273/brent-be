A: My husband doesn’t seem to be very interested in my pregnancy, he doesn’t read the magazines or books that I ask him to, he’s reluctant to go to a childbirth class and I am worried that he might not bond with our baby.e sure to take time during pregnancy to enjoy your relationship and strengthen the bond that you have as a couple. Try not to worry about his lack of interest in the color of the nursery walls and rest assured that he is preparing to be a father in his own unique way.
