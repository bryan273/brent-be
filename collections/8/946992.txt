A throat tickle can be caused by a wide variety of things. Sometimes a tickling, scratchy throat can indicate the onset of a cold. Allergies to foods or food additives, and environmental allergies to smoke, dust mites, mold, or pollen, can result in an itchy, tickling throat. Post-nasal drip or a dry throat can irritate the throat and cause a tickle.
