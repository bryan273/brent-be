Report This| Share this:Dr. Goldberg how long does medication stay in your system?Citalopram and Lamictal each have a half life of about a day and, rule of thumb, medicines reach a steady state (or are eliminated from your system) in five half-lives....so, in the case of citalopram or Lamictal, each is about 5 days.
