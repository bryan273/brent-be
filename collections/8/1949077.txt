1 Dermoid Cysts, though rarely found in the brain, are usually located at the lower back portion of the brain (the posterior fossa) in older adults and in the lower end of the spine in older children and young adults.  Epidermoid Cysts tend to be located in the area where the top part of the brain meets the brain stem.
