Some of my fondest memories growing up in nearby Pittsfield were in the Village of New Berlin. Whether it was playing in the baseball leagues, going to New Berlin Youth Days Fair, working on the DPW, or simply going to a friendâ€™s house. I remember the friendly and community oriented environment, and it was for this reason that my wife and I chose to call the Village of New Berlin home for our family.
