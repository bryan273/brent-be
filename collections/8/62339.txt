1 This will be the structure on which you build your floor and your outhouse structure. 2  If you're using concrete, you will need to build a wooden form in which you will pour a concrete ring sill. 3  Go for 4 inches (10.2 cm) thick and make sure to leave a hole in the center! Level it over the hole you dug.ou'll need to use at least 6 inch (15.2 cm) by 6 inch (15.2 cm) timbers in framing the hole. The amount of timbers, their length and width will be determinate on the size of your chosen outhouse.
