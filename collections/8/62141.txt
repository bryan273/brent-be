The exact frequency a cheat meal should occur doesnâ€™t really exist. It you want to really get technical about it, it would vary based on the person and the exact type of cheat meal being eaten. However, for most of the people, most of the time, 1 or 2 cheat meals per week is the maximum I (and most others) would recommend.
