Three-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr., salutes his father's casket in Washington three days after the president was assassinated in Dallas. The brave little boy, who barely had time to tell his father hello, now said goodbye as the world watched and wept. The country knew him as John-John, the adorable son of slain President John F. Kennedy. It was the morning of Nov. 25, 1963 — the child’s third birthday and the day of his father’s funeral.
