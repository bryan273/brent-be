Experts suggest that you should never cut more than one-third of the height of your grass off at any one time. If your grass is very long, you shouldn't cut it very short in one mowing. If you want it short, you should cut off a third of its height, then wait until the next mowing to cut it shorter, working your way down to the height you want over time. Cutting off most of the height of the grass in one pass will shock the grass and may damage the root system.
