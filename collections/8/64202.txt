A payroll assistant position may not be glamorous, but other employees tend to be grateful for the work you do since it results in paychecks being issued. Your duties will vary depending on the size of your company. In a small business you might do everything except analyze payroll reports and sign the checks, while in a larger company your work may be focused on data entry and clerical tasks. A payroll assistant can report to a payroll supervisor, department head or controller depending on the size and structure of the company.
