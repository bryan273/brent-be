Immediate Care. If there is moderate dehydration and the dog is not throwing up, you can treat the dog with Ringer's lactate (“lactated Ringers” with 5% dextrose in water). You can also administer an electrolytic solution at a rate of 2 to 4 ml per pound (1 to 2 ml per kilogram) of the dog's body weight per hour.
