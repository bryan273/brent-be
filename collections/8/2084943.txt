It is normal for livers to have some fat but if you have more than 5 to 10 per cent of your liver's weight, it's called fatty liver. The ALF also recommends eating high fibre foods and eating spices like turmeric, cinnamon, and licorice to detox your liver. Also avoid deep-fried and fatty foods, smoked, cured and salted foods, and desserts and snacks high in sugar.
