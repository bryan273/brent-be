Answer: Thinning of the retina can occur in the central retina (macular thinning) or the peripheral retina. Central macular thinning happens spontaneously in a small number of individuals and is unrelated to anything that you have done. In most cases, it does not cause serious vision loss; in rare cases, it may lead to a macular hole and require surgery (which carries a very good prognosis). Peripheral retinal thinning is most often related to a condition called lattice degeneration. This is present in 8 to 10 percent of the population and can be present for many years. Lattice degeneration does increase the risk of a retinal tear or retinal detachment.
