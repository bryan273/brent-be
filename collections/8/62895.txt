A: Nifedipine is in a drug class called calcium channel blockers. Nifedipine is used to control angina (chest pain). Nifedipine is also used to treat high blood pressure. Nifedipine relaxes blood vessels, so that the heart does not need to pump as hard. Nifedipine also increases blood and oxygen supply to the heart.
