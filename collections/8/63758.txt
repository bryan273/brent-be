People with dyslexia often have trouble breaking down words as well as putting sounds together to write or pronounce words. Put differently, dyslexics struggle to convert language into thought (in listening or reading) and thoughts into language (in writing or speaking).he good thing is that although dyslexia is a lifelong issue, it can be treated and alleviated once it has been diagnosed. While the primary symptom is delay or difficulty in the ability to read, there are in fact number of ways to recognize dyslexia in pre-school children, school-aged children, and adults.
