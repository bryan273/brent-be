Numbness in the Feet. Numbness in the feet is a loss of sensation or feeling in the feet, as a result of improper communication between the nerves and the central nervous system. Commonly foot numbness is attributed to a blood shortage in the foot. This occurs when someone is sitting cross-legged for an extended amount of time.
