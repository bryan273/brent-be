Lotronex (alosetron) blocks the action of a chemical called serotonin in the intestines. This slows the movement of stools (bowel movements) through the intestines. Lotronex is used to treat severe, chronic irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women who have had diarrhea as the main symptom for at least 6 months. Alosetron should be used only by women who have tried other IBS treatments without success. Alosetron not been shown to be effective in men with IBS.
