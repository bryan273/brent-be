SPINAL STENOSIS. Spinal stenosis is a back condition that specifically describes the narrowing of the spinal canal. This condition can occur for multiple reasons, likely due to a combination of other spinal conditions. Spinal stenosis is most common in the lower (lumbar region) part of the spine and upper (cervical region) part of the spine. Lumbar spinal stenosis and cervical spinal stenosis produce similar symptoms, but in different parts of the body.
