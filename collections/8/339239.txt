While painful and unsightly, most styes heal within a few days on their own or with simple treatment. Typical treatment for a sty consists of applying warm compresses to the affected eye for 10 to 15 minutes four times daily for several days. This not only relieves pain and inflammation but also helps the sty ripen faster. Be sure to close your eye while you apply the compresses.
