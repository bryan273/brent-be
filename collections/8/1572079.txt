Orchitis can be caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Sometimes a cause of orchitis can't be determined (idiopathic orchitis). Most often, bacterial orchitis is the result of epididymitis. Epididymitis usually is caused by an infection of the urethra or bladder that spreads to the epididymis. Often, the cause of the infection is an STI.
