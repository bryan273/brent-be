Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be at least 17 years old. In Minnesota, 16-years-olds may donate with written consent from a parent or guardian. During your donation appointment, you will complete a brief health questionnaire to make sure blood donation is safe for you and the recipient of your blood.
