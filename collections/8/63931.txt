Gould and Gilligan finally give us a concrete time frame for the prequel (about five years before Saul meets Walter White on Breaking Bad) and remind us that when we first meet Saul, his name is actually Jimmy McGill.MC appears to be carefully building up their marketing for Better Call Saul, and while this teaser offers some new footage and an ironically funny line from the always-welcome Odenkirk, itâ€™s actually an impressive little package for all it accomplishes.
