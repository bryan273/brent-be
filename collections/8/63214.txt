Wisdom teeth extraction is a very common procedure to fix or prevent problems with your last set of molars. You can eat soft food and return to regular, daily activities the day after surgery. Recovery from wisdom teeth surgery takes about three days, but can take up to a week or more. Itâ€™s important that you follow the at-home care instructions that your dentist gives you in order to aid healing and prevent infection.
