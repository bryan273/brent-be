Later that year, the U.S. government allowed Kobe beef into the country. The American distributor of Kobe beef is Fremont Beef Co. of Fremont, Neb. Laun Hinkle, Fremont's sales manager, tells me you should ask to see proof of authenticity before ordering any meat described on the menu as Kobe beef.. A restaurant or market with the real stuff should be eager to show you the certification.
