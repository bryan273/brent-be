As of December 2013, a representative roll of fiberglass insulation suitable for roof installation cost 29 cents per square foot at a home improvement center. A comparable roll of reflective insulation cost 43 cents per square foot at the same location. Though exact prices will vary by store and region, this price ratio is fairly consistent, meaning you can expect fiberglass to cost about three-quarters the price of reflective insulation.
