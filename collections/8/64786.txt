written by Hana, February 27, 2008. i love this name too! it is my name! and i really think that a name means a lot by the meaning of it. and that a name even as some thing to do with who you become! and who you are... i really like the Arabic meaning of my name, (Happiness) i am a very happy Girl.. I really like it, I think the Japanese meaning is lovely, my parents picked it for the Arabic though. I do like the name Hannah. But Hana is just a more unique way to do Hannah. Everybody's name is Hannah, but Hana isn't something you hear alot.
