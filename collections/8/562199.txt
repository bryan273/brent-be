Characteristics of Protists. Protists are eukaryotic organisms that cannot be classified as a plant, animal, or fungus. They are mostly unicellular, but some, like algae, are multicellular. Kelp, or 'seaweed,' is a large multicellular protist that provides food, shelter, and oxygen for numerous underwater ecosystems.he animal-like protists are also known as protozoans, which is Latin for 'first animals.' All protozoans are single-celled heterotrophs and are categorized based on their movement. Paramecia are examples of protozoans that use cilia, or tiny hairs, to propel themselves through the water.
