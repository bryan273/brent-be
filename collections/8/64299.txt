Prudent landlords usually keep old leases for six or seven years. Legal obligations associated with the landlord-tenant relationship don't automatically end when the lease agreement ends. Disputes often survive the lease expiration date, and, for landlords earning an income from rental property, the tax man can challenge tax returns from the past six years -- more if the Internal Revenue Service suspects fraud.
