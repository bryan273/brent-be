I personally don't care to use the MMR to figure used car trade in values, but do reference it, because my dealer requires me to. Usually, what I like to do is figure the KBB Wholesale Value and shoot for a 20% discount, knowing that I may pay up to the full wholesale book value if it's a nice car that I feel will sell fast.
