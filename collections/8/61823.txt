Asker's rating. 1  Atomic number as listed on the periodic table is Carbon 6. 2  If Carbon 12 has 8 neutrons than it must have 4 protons to have a mass number of 12, thus carbon 12. 3  Carbon 12 refers to the mass of the carbon atom in atomic mass units (amu), which is the mass of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Atomic number for all Carbon atoms is 6, this also refers to the number of protons in the nucleus. Any atom with only 6 protons in the nucleus will be carbon regardless of atomic mass.
