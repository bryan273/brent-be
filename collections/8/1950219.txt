? What is? the root cause for this SCC What is the problem with SCC SCC can threaten the integrity of the ammonia containment equipment. Stress Corrosion Cracking has been detected in ammonia storage tanks, spheres and other process equipment that is in contact with liquid ammonia.t is difficult to repair SCC damage. Often complete replacement of the equipment (like a new tank) is necessary when SCC is found.The presence of oxygen (air) and residual stress are the causes for forming SCC cracks. Therefore the ingress of air into ammonia containing equipment must be prevented.
