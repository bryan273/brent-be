Headaches in the back of the head may be caused by a variety of ailments and injuries. Chronic headaches in the back of the head -- also known as occipital headaches -- are often variants of tension-type headaches or migraines. New-onset occipital headaches are a more urgent concern. Possible causes include blood vessel abnormalities, nerve disorders and serious traumatic injuries.
