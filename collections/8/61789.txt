To make compost, a player must place 15 weeds, vegetables (not tomatoes unless you put one weed in beforehand) or another grown item (Fever grass, Flax, Primweed, Stinkbloom, Tansymum, Leaves, or Lavender) into any of the compost bins that are located next to the allotment patches found around RuneScape.
