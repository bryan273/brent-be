Medications for GERD. What is GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is when food or liquid travels from the stomach back up into the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach). This partially digested material is usually acidic and can irritate the esophagus, often causing heartburn and other symptoms.
