Bland grain foods might settle your stomach and ease your nausea. Eat two or three soda crackers before you get out of bed in the morning, the American Pregnancy Association recommends. A dry piece of toast or a handful of pretzels might also help. Other bland foods, such as a plain baked potato or a bowl of chicken broth, might also alleviate your nausea.
