De Quervain's tenosynovitis (also called de Quervain’s disease or de Quervain’s syndrome) is a painful inflammation of tendons in the thumb that extend to the wrist. The swollen tendons rub against the narrow tunnel they pass through. That causes pain at the base of the thumb and into the lower arm.
