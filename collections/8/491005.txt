Heart block typically causes lightheadedness, fainting, and palpitations. Depending on the severity of the heart block, this can be dangerous. For example, a third-degree heart block can worsen pre-existing conditions, such as heart failure. It can cause loss of consciousness and even sudden cardiac arrest. There can also be chest pain.
