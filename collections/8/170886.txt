Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood. Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines â€” substances that are found naturally in your body, as well as in certain foods, such as steak, organ meats and seafood.
