Breath Sounds - Crackles. You are now listening to a typical example of breath sounds with scattered wet crackles. Also known as rales, these abnormal breath sounds are usually caused by excessive fluid within the airways. This fluid could be due to an exudate, as in pneumonia or other infections of the lung, or a transudate, as in congestive heart failure.
