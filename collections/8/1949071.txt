Tarlov and other spinal cysts. There are several kinds of cysts that occur in and around the spine. The most common and the least understood occur in the sacrum or tail bone. These are commonly called Tarlov cysts after the neurosurgeon who described them over 70 years ago. These are the most common of all the sacral cysts.
