Anesthesia for Gallbladder Surgery. General anesthesia is used during gallbladder surgery. The surgery begins with the administration of an IV sedative to relax the patient. Once the drug takes effect, the anesthesia provider inserts a breathing tube, or endotracheal tube, through the patientâ€™s mouth into the windpipe.
