Scalp Treatment marks the first occasion Dal McKennon provided any dialogue for Buzz Buzzard, albeit off-screen (he says the brief line, No got wampum!, in an unusually deep voice). It is the first line of dialogue Buzz spoke since McKennon took over the role from original actor Lionel Stander (who was forced from the role in 1951 when he was blacklisted).
