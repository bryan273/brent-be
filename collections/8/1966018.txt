Also during this first visit, the doctor will try and predict your due date. This is also referred to as the estimated date of delivery, or EDD, or the estimated date of confinement, or EDC. An average pregnancy is 280 days, or 40 weeks, from the first day of the last menstrual period. However, a normal pregnancy can last between 37 weeks and 42 weeks. Only about 5 percent of babies are born on their exact due date. Most women give birth within two weeks of the predicted date.
