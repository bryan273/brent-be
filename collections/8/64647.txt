Other Uses for Gears. There are many other ways to use gears. For example, you can use conical gears to bend the axis of rotation in a gear train by 90 degrees. The most common place to find conical gears like this is in the differential of a rear-wheel-drive car. A differential bends the rotation of the engine 90 degrees to drive the rear wheels: Another specialized gear train is called a planetary gear train.
