Q: When would furloughed workers go back to work? A: Late Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget asked workers to return to work Thursday. Usually, furloughed workers are expected back to work the next work day after a furlough ends. But the vote Wednesday came late, so workers should also listen for further guidance from their own departments.
