Some people are more likely to have dry skin. Some causes of dry skin are: Age: As we age, our skin becomes thinner and drier. By our 40s, many people need to use a good moisturizer every day. Climate: Living in a dry climate such as a desert. Skin disease: People who had atopic dermatitis (also called eczema) as a child tend to have dry skin as adults. Psoriasis also causes very dry skin. Job: Nurses, hair stylists, and people in other occupations often immerse their skin in water throughout the day. This can cause the skin to become dry, raw, and cracked.
