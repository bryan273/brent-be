Proton pump inhibitors. What are Proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors (also called PPIs) reduce the production of acid by the stomach. They do this by irreversibly blocking the actions of an enzyme responsible for acid production, H+/K+ ATPase, that is located in the parietal cells in the stomach wall.
