Here it is; a list of 20 animals whose gestation ( period of pregnancy) is longer than that of humans: Cow: Actually cows are not pregnant for that much longer than humans; they give birth to the calves after 10 months but even one month counts, right? Horse: The typical pregnancy for a mare is around 11 to 12 months. Sea Lion: Sea lions too deliver their pups after a gestation period of 11 to 12 months. The only compensation is that their little ones are really cute. Llama: Again a Llama mama has to carry her young one for about 11 to 12 months.
