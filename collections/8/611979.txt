Platelets play an essential role in normal hemostasis. In primary hemostasis, platelets bind to the damaged vessel wall, forming an initial platelet plug. The platelet plug is then stabilized by fibrin, which is generated through the activation of clotting factors in secondary hemostasis. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is often diagnostically and therapeutically challenging. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology and principal differential diagnoses for thrombocytopenia in dogs is vital to develop an appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach.
