Different than Gas Heaters, Heat Pumps work by gathering in warm air surrounding the pool, compressing it, and using it to heat a constant cycle of pool water. Designed for use in sunny climates that rarely see temperatures drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the spring and fall, Heat Pumps are easy to use and very cost-efficient.
