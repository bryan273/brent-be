A sudden, sharp pain, lasting from a few seconds to 15 minutes, is the most common symptom of a muscle cramp. However, in some cases, a bulging lump of muscle tissue beneath the skin can accompany a cramp as well. Muscle cramps have several causes. Some cramps result from overuse of your muscles. This typically occurs while youâ€™re exercising. Muscle injuries and dehydration can also trigger cramps. Dehydration is the excessive loss of fluids in the body.
