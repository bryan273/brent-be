Liver Function Tests. For blood testing a syringe with a fine needle is used to remove a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. You should only feel a tiny pinprick as this done. The sample can be taken by your GP or a nurse at your local clinic, or by hospital staff. It will then be sent to a laboratory to be tested.
