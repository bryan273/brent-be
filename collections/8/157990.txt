Some diuretics were subsequently developed to address the issue of potassium loss. These blood pressure medications are known as potassium-sparing diuretics. They include amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium). Finally, there are the combination diuretics, which include a potassium-sparing agent and a traditional diuretic.
