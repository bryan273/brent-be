When the liver becomes inflamed, conditions such as blood congestion, cell swelling (liver), increased secretion and retention of bile, and liver cell necrosis all increase the pressure to the liver membrane. This in turn causes the dull pain or discomfort in the liver area. During palpation, this area will also feel tender. The gallbladder is actually the more frequent the cause of this symptom since anatomically, gallbladder is literally buried in the lower surface of the liver.
