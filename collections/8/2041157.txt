In your own words, describe the difference between a primary scientific source and a secondary scientific source. Secondary scientific literature is generally contained in works such as books, chapters or review articles. Primary scientific papers may be difficult to read if the general subject is not well understood. Reading secondary resources first may help to place the research in context.
