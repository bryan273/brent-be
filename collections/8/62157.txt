After a colonoscopy, most patients have no memory of the test. You will be watched until the effects of the medicine you were given to help you relax and stay comfortable wear off. Your provider will explain the results. You will be told when you can eat and be active.ctivity-You should not drive a vehicle or perform strenuous activities on the afternoon or evening following colonoscopy. Unless you have had a polypectomy, you should be able to resume all normal activities the day after your colonoscopy.
