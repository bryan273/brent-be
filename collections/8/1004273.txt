Eat & Live Well! A different response: One cup of fresh green beans with a bit of water takes about 3-4 minutes to cook in a microwave oven. Increase time by about 2 minutes for each cup of beans, checking frequently for done-ness. Canned green beans only need about 2 minutes to warm 2 cups with a bit of liquid.
