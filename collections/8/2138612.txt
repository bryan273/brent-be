Causes of Mittelschmerz or Ovulation Pain or Midcycle Pain. Before the release of the egg with ovulation, the growth of the follicle causes the surface of the ovary to stretch resulting in pain. The ruptured follicle may cause release of blood or fluid leading to irritation of the abdominal lining (peritoneum) and causing pain.
