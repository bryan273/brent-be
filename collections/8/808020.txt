In today’s podcast I’m going to make the case for medical marijuana in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. First I want to give you a general defense of medical marijuana. Then, I’ll tell you what I’ve seen in my own practice. Finally, I will explain in brief three studies, two for anxiety and one for depression where medical marijuana has been of great benefit. It’s generally true that little stories, one specific case after another, add up to an enormous amount of what we call anecdotal evidence.
