Productivity: 9 ton payload x 55.5km/h = 499.5 Ton/Km-hr. Average Fuel Usage per Hr: 105 litres/ 4.5hr = 23, 3 litres/hr. Fuel Used expressed in Ton/Km-litre: 499.5/ 23.3 litres/hr = 21.43 Ton/Km-litre/hr. Assume that after review of the operation a few improvements can be achieved.The 250 kilometre trip is now completed in 4 hours and the full payload of 10 tons is carried.uel Used expressed in Ton/Km-litre: 499.5/ 23.3 litres/hr = 21.43 Ton/Km-litre/hr.
