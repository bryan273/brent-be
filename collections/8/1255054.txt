Engine Oil Pressure Warning. The engine oil pressure warning light comes on when the oil pressure sensor detects low oil pressure. This could indicate low engine oil level, a loss of engine oil pressure or a faulty engine oil pressure sensor. The engine oil level and pressure should be checked immediately. Low oil level or low oil pressure will cause serious damage to the internally lubricated parts of the engine. Battery/Charging Alert.
