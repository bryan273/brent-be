Couplet Poems & Couplet Poetry. Couplet poems, or couplet poetry, are poems comprised of two rhyming lines of verse. They can be as short as one couplet (two lines), or as long as it takes to tell the poem. While it might sound easier to write just two-line poems, this is not always the case. The shorter the poem, the more impact there must be on every word used.
