Dyslexia is a life long disorder, however, many children with dyslexia respond very well to early intervention and appropriate teaching strategies & modifications in the classroom. Keep in mind that just as no two people are alike, no two people with dyslexia are alike.f your child has three or more of the above symptoms speak with your childâ€™s teacher about having him/her tested for dyslexia. No single test can be used to diagnose dyslexia, so multiple tests should be given (as many as 10-12 since dyslexia encompasses so many areas of learning).
