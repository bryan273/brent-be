“Green Giant” arborvitae can grow to a maximum of 60 feet tall and 12 to 18 feet wide. Many people do not realize how large they will get when they bring them home from the nursery and plant them too close together -- they should be at least 5 feet apart for a hedge -- or not give them enough vertical room.ith its tall, statuesque green boughs and tolerance to a wide variety of conditions and pests, “Green Giant” (Thuja “Green Giant”) doesn’t have many strikes against it. A highly structured looking arborvitae, “Green Giant” is hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 5 through 8.
