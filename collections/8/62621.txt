I can tell you first hand that OP’s are throwing there AR’s at me to get SCAR’s than i have on hand. Yes you can change the upper on a AR-10 to get diffrent barrel lengths but a SCAR barrel is more compact than that of a AR upper. When you look at upkeep for 7.62 AR’s in the field there cost is way more than that of the SCAR.
