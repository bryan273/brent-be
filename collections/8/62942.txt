How long have you been taking it and at what dose? Flomax is eliminated mainly thru the kidneys. The half life is 9-13 hours. Meaning that in 9-13 hours after your last dose 50% is out os your system, in another 9-13 hours 75% is out of your system and in another 9-13 hours almost 100% is out of your system. So a total of aprox 36 hours it will be out of your system. Thanks!!!
