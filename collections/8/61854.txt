Consider the following rhombus ABCD, where diagonals AD and BC intersect at O. In a rhombus all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel. Further a rhombus is also a parallelgram and hence exhibits properties of a parallelogram andwe use that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Hence in #DeltasABP# and #BCO#, we have. #AO=CO# - diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. #AB=BC# - sides of a rhombus
