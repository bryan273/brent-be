Damage to the skin's surface is called Skin Breakdown. While pressure is an important cause for pressure sores, edema, low blood flow, drugs used to correct low blood pressure and poor nutrition also increase the risk for skin breakdown. Skin can also be damaged by friction, infections, excessive perspiration and chemical irritation from urine, stool or other secretions.
