People with myositis caused by a virus usually have symptoms of a viral infection, such as runny nose, fever, cough and sore throat, or nausea and diarrhea. But the symptoms of viral infection may go away days or weeks before myositis symptoms begin. Some people with myositis have muscle pain, but many do not.
