Undiagnosed severe left flank pain for months - is this kidney related? I have had severe left flank pain for 3 months now and still not been able to get a diagnosis. I am a 24 year old usually fit female. The pain started towards the end of April while i was in work (an office desk job). It was on my left side in between my hip and ribs, spreading down to my groin.
