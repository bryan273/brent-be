The fat pad in your knee sits just below your knee cap and provides cushioning and shock absorption between the bones of your knee joint. It is also known as Hoffaâ€™s pad and is one of the most sensitive components of your knee joint. Pain is most often caused by the fat pad becoming pinched between the end of your thigh bone and your kneecap.
