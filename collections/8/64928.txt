For the unit alone, an electric tankless water heater costs from $550 to $1,600 and a gas tankless water heater costs $1,000 to $1,800. However, because of the prolonged and complicated installation process, expect to add several hundred to a couple thousand dollars more in installation costs. Have you had a water heater installed recently?
