Dry Socket Symptoms. The pattern that dry socket symptoms appear is common, with the discomfort decreasing for the first two days after the tooth extraction when, at about the third day the discomfort starts to become progressively more intense. The most common and disturbing of the dry socket symptoms is the intense pain. The dry socket pain is usually very intense, constant and sometimes throbbing. It cannot generally be relieved by over-the-counter painkillers.
