The challenge for early childhood educators in Australia is how and if to adapt these ideas to our Australian context (Fleet, Patterson, Hammersley, Schillert, Stanke; 2006, p.312). Pedagogical documentation follows children’s and educators’ thinking and finds ways to make that thinking visible.owever, it is not just a document in which we celebrate children’s experiences ‘after the event’. Pedagogical documentation is a way of keeping the process of thinking and the ‘problem at hand’ open and visible to the group of children and adults while it is occurring (Olsson, 2009).
