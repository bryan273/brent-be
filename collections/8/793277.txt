Metformin is a doctor's first choice as it can be easily taken with a lot of other meds. I experienced a lot of tummy pain as well and found through a ultrasound that my Gallbladder was enlarged, common with diabetics, hence the stomach pain. Good luck! Since taking Metformin, I have been experiencing excessive gas. Honestly, it's brutal. Doctor said it's very common and will need to cope with it. She said it should ease up in time as my system adjusts to it. Tell that to my family. Of course my son thinks it's extremely funny, wife not so much.
