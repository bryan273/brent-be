Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, PVC) are premature heartbeats originating from the ventricles of the heart. Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat. The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles.
