Propane exists as a liquid and a gas. At atmospheric pressure and temperatures. above –44 F, it is a non-toxic, colorless and odorless gas. Just as with natural. gas, an identifying odor is added so it can be readily detected. When contained in. an approved cylinder or tank, propane exists as a liquid and vapor. The vapor is. released from the container as a clean-burning fuel gas. Propane is 270 times. more compact as a liquid than as a gas, making it economical to store and. transport as a liquid. Approximately 90 percent of the United States’ propane supply is produced. domestically, while 70 percent of the remaining supply is imported from Canada. and Mexico.
