Grill over direct medium-high heat 4 minutes per side with lid down. If chops are thicker (1 1/2), grill for about 10 minutes per side. Can brush with sauce in last few minutes of grilling. Any type of cooking of pork chops... The idea would be to get the internal temperature of the pork to be around 160 degrees.
