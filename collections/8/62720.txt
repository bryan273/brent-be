Survival will be based on the duration the puppy was hypothermic and the health of the puppy prior to experiencing hypothermia. During the first four days of a puppy's life, the orphaned dog should be maintained in an environmental temperature of 85º to 90ºF (29.4º to 32.2ºC). The temperature may gradually be decreased to 80ºF (26.7ºC) by the seventh to tenth day and to 72ºF (22.2ºC) by the end of the fourth week.
