Orthodontic/Migraine Headache. During orthodontic treatment some patients complain of experiencing headaches when the teeth are being moved. This can easily result from muscle imbalances and/or sore teeth during the treatment process. But when the braces are removed and the patient still complains of daily headaches there is something very wrong.
