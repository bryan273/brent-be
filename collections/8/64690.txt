 Pedagogical Documentation in Early Childhood defines the process of pedagogical documentation and asks what a classroom experience says about a child’s ideas and learning process, providing keys to creating the kinds of documentation that help foster and explain children’s explorations.usan interweaves the theory and practice beautifully and the photographs of the projects and documentation give readers real-life examples to inspire their journey. It takes time, but Pedagogical Documentation in Early Childhood is an excellent first stop on your journey of transformation.”.
