What can I take for a headache while I am breastfeeding my baby? Breastfeeding moms can take acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve). Aspirin is generally avoided in breastfeeding. I have a sinus infection and my doctor prescribed amoxicillin. But my baby is getting amoxicillin right now for an ear infection.
