Drink plenty of water. Low blood pressure can accompany dehydration, so you may be able to raise your blood pressure by increasing your water intake. Aim to drink at least eight to ten 8 oz cups of water per day. You should drink more water if this doesnâ€™t help your symptoms or if you spend time outdoors or exercising.
