Causes of Meningioma. The causes of meningioma are not clear, though one possible culprit is hormonal fluctuations that may cause the tumors to grow (however, more research is needed on this hypothesis). It is also unclear whether whatever prompts these meninges cells to multiply out of control is inherited, related to a personâ€™s environment or both.
