Inflammation that is toxic in origin, infectious or immunological may be seen on the eyelid thanks to Demodex mites, but in most cases the symptoms are usually those not specific and just involve dry eyes or discomfort. Eye redness or the scabbed edges of the eyelid is also often reported. The mites causing the problem are microscopic and cannot be seen by human eyes, and will tend to grow and multiply whist you are asleep. They hide deep inside your eyelash follicles and glands, making treatment very difficult.
