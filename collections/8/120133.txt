Pelvic organ prolapse is caused by the failure of weakened or injured muscles and connective tissue in a woman's pelvis. The pelvic muscles and connective tissue stretch or break, allowing a pelvic organ, such as the uterus, cervix, bladder, urethra, rectum, or small intestine, to push through to the vaginal canal.
