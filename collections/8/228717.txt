Early satiety is dangerous because it interferes with your daily intake of nutrients. When you eat less, you may not get enough calories and nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, iron, B12, folic acid, and calcium. This can cause you to have problems like anemia and osteoporosis (weak bones). Call your doctor if you have early satiety, even if you donâ€™t have any other symptoms.
