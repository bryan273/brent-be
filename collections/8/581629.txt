Congenital hyperinsulinism causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).The symptoms of hypoglycemia in infants are often difficult to identify, as they can be similar to normal infant activities. More severe symptoms, such as seizures and coma, can occur with a prolonged low blood sugar or an extremely low blood sugar.
