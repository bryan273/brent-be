Though I never heard it again. This Des O'Connor song has nothing to do with the song Drop That Name from the Comden & Green musical Bells Are Ringing.. ++++++++++++++ The song is actually called 'The Name Song' and it was written by Des's writer, Tony Hawes, in the late 60s. The tune is 'Nola' by Felix Arndt, written in around 1925.
