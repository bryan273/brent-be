People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) know all too well the inflammation and pain that comes with the disease. Although there's no RA diet that treats the condition, some foods can lower inflammation in your body. And because they're good for you, these foods -- including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and fish -- may help you feel better overall.
