Incubate the eggs in an incubator designed for parrot or exotic bird eggs. The incubator you use should have accurate temperature control within one-tenth of one degree, and ideally a system for humidity control. Maintain the temperature at 99.3 degrees F, and the humidity at 40 to 50 percent. To maximize hatch rate, incubate larger eggs at the low end of this scale and smaller eggs at the high end. Set the incubator to automatically rotate the eggs every one to two hours. Most incubators do not perform a full rotation, so you should rotate the eggs 180 degrees by hand once a day.
