Even when some of my loaves don't turn out so well, they can be sacrificed to the altar of thrift. When life gives you a bread disaster, you make breadcrumbs, one of my favourite kitchen staples. Stale bread and breadcrumbs serve several purposes in the kitchen. They are used as a binding agent (in meatballs and sausages). They act as a delicious protective coating to seal in both flavour and juices in dishes such as the retro classic chicken kiev or in schnitzels.
