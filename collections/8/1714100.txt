This type of pain can also be a result of certain bone diseases. This condition is commonly known as collar bone pain, but for the sake of discussion letâ€™s use the generally accepted medical term, which is clavicle pain. The most common cause of clavicle pain is a fracture in the clavicle itself. In many cases, the clavicle is protected by hard bones. However, if it received a hard beating, a fracture can happen. The clavicle can also be fractured if there is a tension as a result of violent movements.
