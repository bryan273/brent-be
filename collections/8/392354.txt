I have been pregnant two times and both times I knew I was pregnant like the next day...I started having really bad nausea and starting throwing up after like 2 days...so I knew...so I believe it is possible to feel pregnancy symptoms immediately after you conceive at least I did! posted 11/06/2007 by Mama of 2 angels.
