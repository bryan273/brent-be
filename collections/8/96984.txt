Crackles heard in the lungs of a person with pneumonia using a stethoscope. Crackles, crepitations, or rales (/ˈrɑːlz/ RAHLZ or /ˈrælz/ RALZ) are the clicking, rattling, or crackling noises that may be made by one or both lungs of a human with a respiratory disease during inhalation. They are often heard only with a stethoscope (on auscultation).
