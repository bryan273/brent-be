If you donâ€™t owe any federal income tax because of deductions and other credits, the entire $1,000 refundable credit counts as a tax overpayment and is refunded to you. For example, if you owe $1,900 in taxes, the nonrefundable $1,500 portion of the credit is used first to reduce your tax bill to $400.
