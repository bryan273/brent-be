Vaccine Basics. Hib vaccine prevents serious infections caused by a type of bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae type b. Such infections include meningitis (an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia (lung infection), and epiglottitis (a severe throat infection). Hib vaccine is recommended for all children under five years old in the United States, and it is usually given to infants starting at two months old.
