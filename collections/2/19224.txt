Pikachu and Jibanyan alone can be a perfect fight than having their tamers with them, but eventually, I think they should be in for few reasons... For Pikachu's case...just like how Wiz and Boomstick explained in previous battles like Pikachu VS Blanka and Pokemon VS Digimon, Pikachu cannot fight without Ash's orders.
