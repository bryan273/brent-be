This led to the assembly of an Activity Based Physics Suite that includes this textbook. The Physics Suite also includes materials that can be combined in different ways to meet the needs of instructors working in vastly different learning environments. The Interactive Lecture Demonstration Series is designed primarily for use in lecture sessions. Other Suite materials can be used in laboratory settings including the Workshop Physics Activity Guide, the Real Time Physics Laboratory modules, and Physics by Inquiry.
