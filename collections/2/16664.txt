Turkeys lay from early spring to early summer, a span of about 4 months. During that time the turkey will lay 12-18 eggs and then sit on them. If you collect their eggs they will continue to lay, eventually producing an average of 1 egg every 2 days for a possible total of 80-100 eggs. Roughly 1000 eggs The average turkey will lay between 100 and 120 eggs per year and can produce eggs for up to 10 years if well cared for. Production of eggs drops as â€¦ the turkey ages. 8 people found this useful. Andrew Larson.
