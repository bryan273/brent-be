For example, the band gap in a quantum dot, which determines the frequency range of emitted light, is inversely related to its size.In fluorescent dye applications, the frequency of emitted light increases as the size of the quantum dot decreases, shifting the color of emitted light from red to violet.hese quantum dots can contain as few as 100 to 100,000 atoms within the quantum dot volume, with a diameter of ~ 10 to 50 atoms. This corresponds to about 2 to 10 nanometers, and at 10 nm in diameter, nearly 3 million quantum dots could be lined up end to end and fit within the width of a human thumb.
