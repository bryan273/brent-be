The main target organs where parathyroid hormone exerts its effects are the bones and the kidneys. When needed, parathyroid hormone is released by the parathyroid glands into the blood and causes the bones to release calcium and increase levels in the bloodstream. It also causes the kidneys to stop calcium being lost in urine as well as stimulating the kidneys to regulate vitamin d metabolism (see below).
