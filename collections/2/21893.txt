Hypopnea or hypopnoea is overly shallow breathing or an abnormally low respiratory rate. Hypopnea is defined by some to be less severe than apnea (the complete cessation of breathing), while other researchers have discovered hypopnea to have a similar if not indistinguishable impact on the negative outcomes of sleep breathing disorders.
