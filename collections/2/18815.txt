The shrinking vitreous can pull on the retina as it detaches, stimulating the nerves and causing light flashes. PVD is the most common cause of the sudden appearance of eye light flashes, occurring in roughly 50 percent of people with the condition. Floaters also occur frequently with PVD. Despite the rather scary name, PVD is a common age-related eye change that typically develops after age 60. People who are nearsighted have an increased risk for the condition. Vision loss rarely occurs with PVD and the light flashes usually disappear within 1 to 3 months.
