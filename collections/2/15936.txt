Do not apply undiluted essential oils directly to your skin. Irritation and sensitization may result. Essential oils are absorbed through the skin. Using too much can result in an overdose. Be sure to store essential oils out of the reach of children. Do not get essential oils in your eyes, nose, or ears.
