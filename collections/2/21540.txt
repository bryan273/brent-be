If you leave your medication out overnight, you must call 800-448-6472. Choose the option to speak to a nurse. They will transfer you a Medication Specialist. The specialist will ask you questions about where you left it, how long it was out, the temperature, the light exposure, etc. Based on that information, they will instruct you whether or not the medication is safe to use. DON'T GUESS. Take 10 minutes and call the experts.
