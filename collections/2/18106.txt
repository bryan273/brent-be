I just found out that that Pluto is not a planet and that female Reindeer have antlers. And now this- Throughout history we have thought that human beings have only four taste receptors, that we can perceive only the tastes of Salty, Sweet, Bitter and Sour. As it turns out there is a fifth taste receptor called Umami. Umami is the beginning of a whole new sensual pleasure. It is a multidimensional taste sensation that is not only savory, brothy and mouth filling but actually interacts with the other taste receptors.
