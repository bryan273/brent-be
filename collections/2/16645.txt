Pure water changes from solid (ice) to liquid at 0°C as energy is added to it. The ice will cool the water to about 0°C. The energy given up by the water as it cools is the energy used to melt ice. Recall that one calorie is required to change the temperature of one gram of liquid water one Celsius degree.
