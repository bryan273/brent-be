An evaluation for hip dysplasia will likely include a physical examination, radiographs and manual tests on your dogâ€™s hips. Hip dysplasia commonly affects larger breeds of dogs, including bulldogs, mastiffs, American Staffordshire terriers, St. Bernards, retrievers, and Rottweilers. However, dogs of all breeds and all sizes are susceptible to this inherited condition, including some small breeds, such as pugs, and French bulldogs.
