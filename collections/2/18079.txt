The drum set is the instrument central to the rhythm section. It acts as the motor that drives the group. A drum set can contain a multitude of percussion instruments, but in jazz, it usually consists of only a few parts. The lowest drum, or bass drum, is played with a pedal. The hi-hat, also played with a pedal, is a duo of small cymbals that crash together.
