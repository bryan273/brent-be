Walk 0.3 mile on a trail along the eastern shore to an open area of talus and boulders for a good place to sit in the sun above the lake. Nurse those knees for the descent. Lake Constance. A secluded tarn tucked in a cleft high on Mount Constance, this little lake's setting is awesome. Gaze into turquoise waters reflecting sheer cliff faces spiraling to the heavens. But to reach this stunning scene, you too must spiral to the heavens.
