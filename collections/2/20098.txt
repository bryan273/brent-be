4. Move the piano. With your crew supporting the weight of the piano according to its center of gravity, lead it slowly by the dolly to its destination. 1  If the piano is too high on the dolly to move through a doorway, it will have to be lifted and scooted slowly through the door a few inches at a time. The smaller studio uprights usually weigh between 400 and 600 pounds. 2  The monstrous full vertical or large upright piano can weigh as much as half a ton. 3  A studio piano's center of gravity is also lower than a large upright's, as it is about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall as opposed to a large upright's roughly 5-foot height.
