In at least two cases, the whole hilt has been encased in bronze. A sword from Hallstatt grave 607 has a hilt that is cast in bronze directly onto the tang in one operation. What are usually separate side-plates are joined to the tang in the form of a single enveloping unit, much like the full-grip Urnfield swords.
