Solvation is the process in which molecules of a solvent attract the particles of a solute. The main forces in solvation are ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding attractions. It is the main reason why solutes dissolve in solvents. Solvation Due to Ion-Dipole Interactions. Ionic compounds like NaCl dissolve in polar solvents like water.
