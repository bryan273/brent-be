For example, limitations may be placed on the liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index, percent fines, and percent gravel allowed in the soil liner material. The process of selecting construction materials and verifying the suitability of the materials. varies from project to project. In general, the process is as follows: 1. A potential borrow source is located and explored to determine the vertical and lateral extent of the source and to obtain representative samples, which are tested for properties such as liquid limit, plastic limit, percent fines, etc. . 2.
