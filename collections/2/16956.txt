The governor is the visible official who commands media attention. The governor, along with the lieutenant governor, is also a major legislative player. The governor sets forth a recommended legislative agenda, initiates the budget, and signs or vetoes legislative bills. The governor has several other important roles. These include the role of commander of both the Georgia State Patrol and the Georgia National Guard. Often overlooked is the role of intergovernmental middleman, a fulcrum of power and a center of political gravity.
