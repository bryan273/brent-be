Before Anesthesia. It is necessary to have an empty stomach before receiving general anesthesia. In most cases, patients are required to abstain from eating and drinking after midnight on the night before their scheduled surgery to reduce the chances of vomiting while under anesthesia. When a person is under general anesthesia, the body does not work normally.
