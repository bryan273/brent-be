Definition of Entropion. Entropion is the inversion, or rolling inward, of all or part of the edge of an eyelid, which causes the hair-bearing part of the lid to come into contact with the outside of the eyeball. This creates friction, irritation and discomfort and can severely damage the eye. Entropion has a strong genetic component and often is present at birth due to a hereditary abnormality in the dog’s facial structure. It is much more common in breeds with flat faces, short muzzles and heavy facial skin folds. It can also be acquired as a result of trauma, inflammation or infection and from skin laxity associated with aging. Entropion usually – but not always-occurs in both eyes.
