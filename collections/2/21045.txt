1.) lipid peroxidation - destruction of polyunsat fats -> membrane damage and increased permeability. 2.) attacking critical proteins that affect ion pumps and transport mechanisms. 3.) fragmenting DNA - causing decreased protein synthesis. 4.) damaging mitochondria - causing the liberation of calcium into the cytosol.
