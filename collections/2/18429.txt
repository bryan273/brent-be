Which tied all the polymer chains in the rubber together. These are called crosslinks. You can see this in the picture below. Bridges made by short chains of sulfur atoms tie one chain of polyisoprene to another, until all the chains are joined into one giant supermolecule. Yes, folks, this means exactly what you think it does. An object made of a crosslinked rubber is in fact one single molecule.
