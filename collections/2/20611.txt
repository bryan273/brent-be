A second effect that results from warm or cool outside air temperature relates to how hot your barrel becomes during your relay. On a relatively cool day (50 degrees), the outside air is able to absorb more heat from the barrel at a faster rate than it does when the air temperature is 80 or 90 degrees. This helps to keep the barrel cooler with fewer harmful side effects like “baking” the fouling in the barrel which in turn can result in a significant loss of accuracy.
