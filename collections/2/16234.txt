Antonio Vivaldi was a virtuoso violinist, a virtuoso composer  at least in terms of quantity  and a virtuoso teacher, as clearly evidenced by the level of competence attained by his pupils. A Venetian all his life, travelling but always returning, Vivaldi epitomizes Italian Baroque Music like no other composer.
