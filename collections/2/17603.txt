Signature Cocktail â€“ Beam Honey Buck. 25ml Jim Beam Honey, 1 wedge lime, 50ml pressed apple juice, ginger ale. Add Jim Beam to highball glass filled with ice, squeeze over lime wedge, add apple juice and top with ginger ale. Stir well. Jim Beam Honey lacks the honeyed flavour that would have made it an interesting and unique product.
