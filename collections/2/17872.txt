A vegan diet does not permit any foods derived from animal sources, such as meat, dairy products and eggs. Some vegans also avoid honey and gelatin, as well as products produced using animal byproducts, such as commercially produced wines and refined sugar. Vegans represent between 0.3 and 1 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Vegetarian Resource Group. A vegan diet eliminates the saturated fats and chemicals found in animal products; however, vegans may need to take certain vitamins to avoid deficiencies.
