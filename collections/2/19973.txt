All of my life I have been drawn to human Love, suffering, and healing. I founded Soul Water Rising in 2001 to carry forward this life calling. In an often dehumanizing world, we are a global rehumanizing mission, stirring the soul to remember itself. Through compassionate, soulful sharing of insight, inspiration, and story, we support the healing journeys of historically dehumanized populations and cultures.
