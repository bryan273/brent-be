Sedimentary Rocks! A sedimentary rock is just what it sounds like: it is a rock that consists of sediment! Sedimentary rocks can consist of sand, clay, chalk and fossils and as a marine geologist I find sedimentary rocks very fascinating! Some may think that sedimentary rocks is a bit dull since sedimentary rocks isn't created by violent and exciting volcano eruptions from the Earths mantle like the igneous rocks.
