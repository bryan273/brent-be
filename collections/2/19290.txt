This response uses a complex system of nerves and muscles to control blood flow through the smallest blood vessels in the skin. In people with Raynaud's phenomenon, this control system becomes too sensitive to cold and greatly reduces blood flow in the fingers and toes. Blood flow can also be reduced by adrenaline that is released during times of high stress or anxiety.
