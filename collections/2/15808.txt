In order to find the area of an isoceles trapezoid, you must average the bases and multiply by the height. The average of the bases is straight forward: In order to find the height, you must draw an altitude. This creates a right triangle in which one of the legs is also the height of the trapezoid.here is the length of the side opposite the. Beginning with the side, if we were to create a triangle, the length of the base is, and the height is. Creating another triangle on the left, we find the height is, the length of the base is, and the side is. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
