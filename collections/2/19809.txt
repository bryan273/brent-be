The primary topic of a paragraph may be expressed in a topic sentence. The main topic of an essay, report, or speech may be expressed in a thesis sentence. An essay topic, say Kirszner and Mandell, should be narrow enough so that you can write about it within your page limit. If your topic is too broad, you will not be able to treat it in enough detail (Concise Wadsworth Handbook, 2014). See the examples and observations below.
