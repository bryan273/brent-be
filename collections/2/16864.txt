He had his mouth full of aebleskiver when he said: Well, I'm full. Thank you. What the Vikings heard was: Wlmfl, and they thought he said waffle, and the name stuck. So now you know how waffles came to be! Of course we all know how aebleskiver got named.

And the name stuck. See you in Solvang! Richard Allen Lindstr√∂m . Congratulations!
