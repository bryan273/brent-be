Only two U.S. Presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Both were acquitted in trials held by the Senate. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted on Articles of Impeachment for Richard Nixon, but he resigned before the full House of Representatives voted on any of the articles.
