RNA is a single-strand molecule; DNA is a spiral of two cross-connected strands. DNA carries information. Part of the DNA in a cell is genes, which code for protein molecules. Each type of receptor, or enzyme, or neurotransmitter, has a stretch of DNA in which its sequence of amino acids is coded. The code-to-primary-structure ratio is three-to-one: three bases (called a codon) per amino acid.
