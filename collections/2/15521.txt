When creating integrated circuits, using mainly P-channel MOSFET transistors, the device is called 'PMOS'. Similarely, when using mainly N-channel MOSFET, the device is called 'NMOS'. CMOS are the most common devices, which use an equal mix of P-channel and N-channel MOS, and stand for 'complementary MOS'. Above, the term 'MOS' is in face a short for 'MOSFET'. So, MOSFET is a transistor technology, while CMOS is simply a way of designing chips. MOS stand for 'metal-oxide-silicon'.
