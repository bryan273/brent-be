Sometimes we use ghee or butter, but most the time itâ€™s MCT oil, organic coffee, almond milk, and maybe some whey protein. Taste like a latte, but the energy lasts much longer! You can also just add MCT oil to your coffee to get it an extra PERK. ðŸ˜‰ You can also use it in my low carb chocolate smoothie. Second, i LOVE to use in baking. I donâ€™t do it often (due to budgeting) but when i do I use in place of butter or chocolate for dairy free baking/treats. Try this homemade hazelnut latte coconut bark. Ingredients. 1 cup melted coconut oil (you can use half coconut butter if you want to save the MCT oil)
