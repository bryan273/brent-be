It produces only one kind of binucleate spores called the smut pores which are comparable to the teleutospores of rusts. The teleutospores are developed from the terminal cells of the mycelium. Smut spores are formed from the intercalary cells. The teleutospores are stalked, two celled and each cell is binuclate.
