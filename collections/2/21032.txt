Eilistraee doesn't have the domain, but the DM allowed to pick that domain without much thing... I've really apreciated the feedback, and the Idea of Cleric/Warlock/Eldricht Disciple. Hide Skill I'll not pick in this moment, because of my Feat, that will be my form to fake a cleric of Lolth [Wordly Focus].
