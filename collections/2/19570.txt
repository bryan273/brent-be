Competition. Each league has its own set of ladder rankings. Weâ€™ll be frequently creating short term leagues that last varying durations (a day, a weekend, a week, etc) with item rewards for the highest placed characters on the ladder at the end of the league. There are leagues that end once a specific goal has been met (a race to level 90, for example). League competitions are another way for players to get rewarded for their play skill and to be competitive with other players as an alternative to PvP.
