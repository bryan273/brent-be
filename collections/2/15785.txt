The color of blood depends on how much oxygen is in the blood; when here is plenty of oxygen, the blood is more reddish in color. The reason that this is so is because of a protein called HEMOGLOBIN, which carries the oxygen in your blood. When hemoglobin has a full oxygen load, it gives the blood a reddish color.
