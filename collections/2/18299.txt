Cascais. Cascais is a little beach city a bit outside of Lisbon. For me, Cascais was this beautiful recreational place, where time was passing slowly somehow. I loved the beaches surrounded by cliffs and watching the reflections of yachts in the marina.hese are my ten places you can’t miss in Portugal. I know there are a lot more amazing places I could have visited during my semester abroad — I have heard great things about Sagres, Guimaraes, Guimarães braga And coimbra for. Example but those ten places above were What i loved most About. portugal
