What About Me is the debut studio album by Anne Murray issued in 1968 on Arc Records. Upon its release, the album was only issued in Canada (it would later be issued in the U.S. on the Pickwick label, following Murray's 1970s chart success there). The album was reissued in Europe on the Astan label under the title Both Sides Now after original title track What About Me was dropped from the album.
