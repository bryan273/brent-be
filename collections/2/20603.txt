Many shooters believe that humidity (i.e. the amount of moisture in the air) can have a serious impact on accuracy. The theory is that air containing a high degree of moisture must be more dense than dry air. As a result, it must offer more resistance to a bullet in flight than does dry air. The fact of the matter is that the amount of humidity in the air has virtually no effect on bullet accuracy. Thatâ€™s because a water molecule weighs less than a dry air molecule.
