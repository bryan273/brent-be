Districts may cross county lines, as in the case of the Aurora Sanitary District, which covers parts of DuPage and Kane Counties. Districts may also define smaller areas within municipalities, as is the case with the Ridgeville and North East (or Lighthouse) Park Districts within the city of Evanston. In addition to their geographic versatility, special districts provide a powerful public-sector fiscal tool.
