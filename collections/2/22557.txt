Rated 5 out of 5Ã¢ by jamiedebreceni much more than I expected!!! I saw Alessia for the first time at one of my favorite venues and she was amazing! She had three opening acts, two of them whom I didn't really care for. But Craig Stickland, who is also her guitarist, was incredible and I wasn't expecting it! When Alessia came on she owned the stage.
