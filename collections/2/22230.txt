Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder that prevents the blood from clotting normally. The primary symptom is uncontrolled, often spontaneous bleeding in different areas of the body. The amount of bleeding depends on the severity of hemophilia. Internal bleeding, which commonly occurs in the spaces around joints, frequently results in pain and swelling.
