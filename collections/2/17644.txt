I ordered Internet Service from Comcast and they gave me 8 days wait to give me the connection. I requested for an expedited service and they told me that it is under management review and someone will call you back in 24-48 hours. Well still after 4 days no one has called (or care about). Seems like Comcast will always be Comcast (change of name to Xfinity didn't work)...the most hated company along with AT&T.
