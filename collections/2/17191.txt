Texture can be measured by the behaviour of a small handful of soil. when it is moistened with water, worked into a ball and then pressed. out between thumb and forefinger. It is used as a guide to the. proportions of gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, silt and clay in the soil. Texture is important, because it affects the movement and availability. of water and nutrients in the soil. â˜ž.
