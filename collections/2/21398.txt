Since 1971, Soul Train has been the American Bandstand of the African-American community. Even today, Soul Train continues to be the showcase of urban artists and their chart-topping singles. The program also continues to be the place for beautiful dancers and their dance moves, though the dance and the dancers' attire are a bit more risque due to the changing times.
