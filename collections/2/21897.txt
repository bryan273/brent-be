An apnea is indicated if there is an 80%/75% (Respironics/ResMed) reduction in airflow for 10 seconds compared to the average airflow over an extended period of several minutes or if there is no airflow detected for 10 seconds. Apnea/Clear Airway Apnea Detection the the Respironics System One.. An apnea is detected when there is an 80% reduction in airflow from a baseline for at least 10 seconds if there is no airflow detected for 10 seconds. During the apnea, one or more pressure test pulses are delivered by the device.
