Seven teams have won the NCAA tournament without a single defeat to mar their records. Their stories include some of the most storied names in basketball history: Bill Russell. Frank McGuire. Lew Alcindor, John Wooden, Bob Knight... these teams finished perfect seasons by taking home an NCAA championship. It is worth noting, though -- all of these teams turned the trick before the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Bill Russell was one of the future NBA stars that led USF during their winning streak.
