According to the CDC, respiratory symptoms of Spanish influenza include cough, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion and breathing problems. Although similar symptoms are seen with all influenza viruses, they are particularly severe with the Spanish influenza. According to the 2006 study in Nature, modern histopathological analysis of autopsy samples from Spanish flu cases demonstrated extraordinary damage to the lungs with acute focal inflammation of the airways (bronchi) and soft tissue (alveoli) of the lungs.
