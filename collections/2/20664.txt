According to Snapknot.com, the average cost for a wedding photographer is $2,814. However, in cities such as San Francisco and New York, wedding photography prices are closer to $4,000.or example, Iâ€™ve seen engagement sessions run anywhere between $300-$1,200 depending on how many hours the shoot is. Another consideration when it comes to your wedding photography cost is whether or not you want a wedding album included in your package.
