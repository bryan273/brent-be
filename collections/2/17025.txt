vicodin, lortab, lorcet - all contain the narcotic HYDROCODONE while percocet contains the narcotic OXYCODONE. They have different chemical make-ups. All of the hydrocodone meds I listed also contain acetaminophen (tylenol). As far as I'm aware, they do not make a hydrocodone pill that does NOT contain acetaminophen.
