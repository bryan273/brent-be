Love Supreme! Diana Ross, 71, shows off cleavage in white gown at her youngest daughter Chudney's wedding to Josua Faulkner in Hawaii on Sunday. However, all eyes were on Diana, who also wore white, in a stunning low-cut dress that showed off her cleavage. Chudney and Joshua welcomed their first child, daughter Callaway Lane together back in September 2012, who is now two-years-old and acted as their flower girl on the big day. The pair got engaged in January earlier this year.
