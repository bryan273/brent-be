they can't do that. I know this. But what my issue is the unit is telling me I must cover the period only while he was at this unit for his award and not a comprehensive service award like a retirement award. Should I cover the other 6 years of service not in this unit for this ETS award. Update 2: I thank you for all this, but I am a senior NCO.
