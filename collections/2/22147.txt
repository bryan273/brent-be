Shift click, like any other item. As for actually selling it-you can either sell it in the trade channel, or put it on the AH. I will warn you though, that typically people aren't paying too much for levels as it's very easy to level pets, even from 1 to 25.What people are paying for is rare pets, so if you have those you may be able to turn a profit.If you insist on selling levelled pets though, you'd probably find more interest in lv 24's than in lv 25's (due to the level-to-25 achievement).#3.o cage it, right click it in your pet journal, and click Put In Cage. Now, not every pet can be caged. No wild pet can, and there's some criteria for others that can't (I'm not sure exactly what that criteria is, but I think it's something like no achievement or feat of strength pets).
