Sacrocolpopexy means connecting the vagina to the sacrum (the bone at the base of the spine). The term abdominal is used because the operation is performed through an incision (cut) at the bottom of the abdomen. A bikini-line incision is usually used. A piece of nylon tape is stitched to the vaginal vault and the other end is stitched to the sacrum.
