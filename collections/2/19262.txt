The more cooling/heating a system puts out for each unit of energy it consumes, the higher rating it will receive. The higher the efficiency rating of your system, the less energy it will consumeâ€¦that means lower utility bills and less of an impact on the environment. Also, utility companies will often compensate homeowners to the tune of hundreds of dollars to install high-efficiency systems.
