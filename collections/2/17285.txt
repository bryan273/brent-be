Place the letter in your own mailbox. If you have a mailbox on your house, you can place your letter there and alert your mail carrier of its presence by lifting the red metal flag affixed to the side of the box. When the flag is raised, the mail carrier knows that there's a letter that needs to be mailed. If you have a scale at home, you can weigh and measure your letter to determine how much postage you'll need to pay. 2  Record the measurements, then check usps.gov for rates. 3  Affix as many stamps as you need to the top right corner of your letter.
