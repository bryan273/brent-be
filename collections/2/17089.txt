Lie on your back with your knees up, feet firmly planted on the floor and your arms by your side. Tighten your abdominal muscles by drawing your belly button in toward your spine. Raise your butt by pushing through your midfoot and heels until your pelvis is in line with your knees. Squeeze your glutes.
