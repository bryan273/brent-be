If you are cooking the chicken in the oven with an oven bag, this should cut the time down to 60 to 75 minutes for a 3 to 4-pound chicken, or 75 to 90 minutes for a 5- to 7-pound chicken. For a stewed chicken, cook the bird for 60 to 75 minutes for a 3- to 4-pound chicken or 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours for a larger bird, 5 to 7 pounds. If you are grilling a whole chicken, it should take 60 to 75 minutes for a smaller, 3- to 4-pound bird, or 18 to 25 minutes per pound for a larger bird.
