The tools used during the creasing and folding experiments, i.e. the male ruler, female die and load cell were defined as rigid surfaces, which are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. To make the model simple, the folding boundary conditions used during folding was modeled as a rigid body constrained all clamped nodes of the paperboard and a rotation reference point, instead of modeling the clamping procedure.
