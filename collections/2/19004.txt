The Northern European Plain's main use is commercial farming, with little natural vegetation remaining. Elevations vary between 0 and 200 m (about 0 to 650 ft). While mostly used as farmland, the region also contains bogs, heath, and lakes. On the North Sea coast one finds the Wadden Sea, a large tidal area.
