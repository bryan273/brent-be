Staggered Terms. An arrangement whereby only a certain number of members of a board of directors are elected in a given year. For example, a board of directors may have 10 members serving five year, staggered terms where two new members are elected each year. In addition to giving the board consistency in its membership, staggered terms makes hostile takeovers more difficult because the potential acquirer can replace only so many directors at a time. staggered terms
