Q. I've read in one or two places that strawberries continue to ripen after harvest, but most other articles I've read say they don't. Do they continue to ripen after harvest or not? Left to right: Strawberries held at room temperature at 0, 24, and 48 hours (6, 30, and 54 hours after harvest). A. The answer isn't simple, as there are a number of components to ripening, including color development, flavor and aroma development, and fruit softening.
