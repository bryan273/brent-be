For background, I am an English-language scientific editor and have upgraded to Word 2013 from 2010. Often, I find that when I (or other editors) delete the text highlighted by a comment, the actual comment disappears from view. Word is set up so all changes are shown in the mark-up margin. If I restore the text, the comment re-appears. The comments are not visible in All Markup or Simple Markup views.
