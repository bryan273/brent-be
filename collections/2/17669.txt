Re: Broadcast TV Fee. Pretty much everyone on cable tv pays the Broadcast TV fee, and it's not just particular to Comcast. Broadcast stations [your local stations] charge the cable companies fees to carry their programs. In turn, cable companies pass those fees along to the customers. All cable tiers carry the broadcast channels. So, basically, yes, you'll be paying that $5 Broadcast TV fee.
