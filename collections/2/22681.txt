A pseudonym (/ˈsjuːdənɪm/ SEW-də-nim) is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from his or her original or true name (orthonym).any pen names are used to conceal the author's identity. One famous example of this is Samuel Clemens' writing under the pen name Mark Twain. A pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if their real name is deemed to be unsuitable.
