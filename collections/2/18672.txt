While in the asylum, van Gogh painted many of his now classic works, including Irises, The Olive Trees and The Starry Night.. Van Gogh referred to The Starry Night as a failure. Writing his brother, the artist stated that he would be mailing several his way (which Theo tried to sell without success).
