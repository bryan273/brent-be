Structurally, surface rust is not a problem, and depending on the metal's thickness and alloy composition, a level of passivation may be reached. Regardless, it's best to correct surface rust as soon as you see it. The fix is not unlike general paint repair. Start by using an abrasive wheel or sandpaper [2] to cut through the paint and corrosion until clean, bright metal is visible. Next, apply primer, followed by paint [3] , then clear coat.
