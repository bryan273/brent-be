Cost basis reporting: An overview. All sales of mutual funds, most exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks will generate a Form 1099-B that provides detailed cost basis information to help you report capital gains and losses on your tax return.he information you report in column (e) of Form 8949 must match what we send to the IRS on Form 1099-B. We aren't required to make certain adjustments that are necessary for your tax return. For example, we don't adjust basis for wash sales when the purchase or sale is in another account or for taxes paid on gifts.
