The following is a series of observations based on my experiences with reel maintenance, tuning and upgrading. I do not do this professionally. I work on my own reels because I enjoy it. I started to do so a long time ago. little online research will reveal a confusing amount of information, and misinformation, about polishing internal reel components; what is often referred to as super tuning. Some of these will recommend sandpaper for certain parts. I do not recommend sandpaper be used anywhere near a reel.
