For example, in stable rock or with trench shields (boxes), where the sides are nearly vertical (between 75° and 90°), a ladder would be appropriate; ladders must never be used at angles less than 60°. Between 30° and 50° from the horizontal, use a stair system (job-made wood type or earth benched).
