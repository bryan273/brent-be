Eavesdropping is the covert interception of a private communication between two individuals by a third party. In a man-in-the-middle attack, a third party intercepts communications between two parties, usually an end user and a website, typically to access user data. A third-party cookie is placed on a userâ€™s computer by a website from a domain other than the one the user is visiting.
