This is the first exercise of this type I’ve seen in the UK and is clearly a result of the Nuisance Calls and Texts task force recommendations (which identified the data industry as the source of the nuisance call issue); and the Daily Mail exposé of the third party data industry (which alleges that the data industry is fuelled by data illegally collected and sold by big brand companies and websites used and trusted by consumers).
