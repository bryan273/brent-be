2. Pour the sugar and borax into the jar. The borax is what will kill the ants, and the sugar is what will attract them to the borax. Ants don't see borax as a food source, so they won't come near itâ€”the sugar will be an effective bait.prinkle the powder across the ant trail. If the ants are entering your house through the windows and doors, sprinkle the powder across the doorway and on the window ledge. The ants will pick up the powder and carry it back to the hive for the larva to eat. The borax in the powder will kill the larva.
