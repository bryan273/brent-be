Aphrodite: Not at all.. Raised in the Greek Orthodox church, Aphrodite went to a public elementary school and then to Long Island Lutheran High School. The school was wealthy. I spent a lot of time in big houses on Long Island's North Shore. The Great Gatsby territory. My friends from that time are still in my life to this day..
