Trying a Home Remedy. 1  1. Drip tea tree oil on your nail. Tea tree oil has been used as an antiseptic and fungicide for centuries. 2  2. Make a baking soda, peroxide, white vinegar, and salt scrub. Combine four cups hot water, 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide, and 1/2 cup Epsom salts. 3  3. Lather pure orange oil on your nail. Like tea tree oil, orange oil is used as a fungicide and can help eliminate nail fungus. Be sure to get the oil under the toenail as well as on top on it. Be sure you are not allergic to orange oil by testing it on a small patch of skin before applying.
