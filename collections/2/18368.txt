Difference between lethargic and obtunded. 2 I'm a new RN, and new on a neuro trauma ICU. It is very important that I understand assessment descriptions. My last pt. was an SAH/SDH whose only response was localization to deep (and I mean deep) painful stimuli. No spontaneous movement and follows commands x0. 8 on the GCS. I described her in my assessment as obtunded. My preceptor corrected me and pointed out that she was lethargic.
