Hi Jennifer, You can get seed from a head of cabbage if you grow it yourself. It is a biennial vegetable so it will grow the head the first year and if you leave it in the ground over the winter it will sprout seed heads the next year. You can buy seeds to plant or you can also find seedlings to transplant at garden centers.
