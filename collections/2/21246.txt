Making soy sauce at home is a lot like making wine at home: it's expensive, time consuming, failure-prone, and probably going to produce a worse product than running out to the store. I have to admit: I have not done this. (With the soy sauce, I mean. I've produced wine. No, you don't want any.) I am generalizing from what I've read about the soy sauce process, and I've seen it done on the tee-vee. So take this with (ahem) a grain of salt. Soy sauce is made by fermenting soybeans and wheat flour with a mold called Aspergillus oryzae. (Leave out the flour, and you get tamari rather than soy sauce). The same mold is used to ferment rice into sake. It's available through some brewing web sites.
