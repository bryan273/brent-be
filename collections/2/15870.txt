How Does Parathyroid Hormone Increase Blood Calcium? Like all endocrine glands, parathyroids make a hormone (a small protein capable of causing distant cells in the body to react in a specific manner). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has a very powerful influence on the cells of the bones which causes them to release their calcium into the bloodstream. Calcium is the main structural component of bones which give them their rigidity--but remember from our first page, the principle purpose of the bones is to provide a storage system for calcium--so our brain will never be without calcium.
