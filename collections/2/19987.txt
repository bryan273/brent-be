The outer layer is often weather-, oil-, or abrasion-resistant, depending upon the type of environment the hose is designed for. Not surprisingly, hydraulic hoses have a finite life. Proper sizing and use of the correct type of hose will certainly extend the life of a hose assembly, but there are many different factors that affect a hose's lifespan. SAE identifies some of the worst offenses as: 1  flexing the hose to less than the specified minimum bend radius. 2  twisting, pulling, kinking, crushing, or abrading the hose. 3  operating the hydraulic system above maximum or below minimum temperature.
