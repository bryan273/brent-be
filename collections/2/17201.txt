4. Re: Fort Meyers or Fort lauderdale. Dec 08, 2012, 1:03 PM. If the flight arrival times were the same I would always go for Fort Myers, however, in this case, arriving early afternoon in Fort Lauderdale will see you in Naples much earlier. Fort Lauderdale airport is a simple exit then one straight drive all the way to Naples. You can do in 2 hours max.
