I couldn’t cross my legs BEFORE I had the surgery and tying shoes was enough of a problem that I wore slip-ons for a year before surgery. It took awhile for me to be able to tie shoes – several months. In the meantime, I used a couple of the handy gadgets that I was given that helped me put on and remove sox & shoes.
