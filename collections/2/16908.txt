WEBER COUNTY â€” One of the Great Salt Lake's most notable oddities, its two-toned color scheme, is drawing renewed attention. The Union Pacific railroad plans to apply for permission soon to reconstruct portions of the company's 20-mile-long Great Salt Lake Causeway that stretches across the lake west of Ogden. Although it's a relatively small-scale project, the upgrade proposal is being watched closely by a variety of interest groups.
