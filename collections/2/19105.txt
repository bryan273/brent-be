The waiting period to receive temporary disability (TD) payments differs from state to state. In California, for example, TD payments can begin within three days of when your doctor says you are unable to work. In Ohio, TD payments begin on the eighth day if you are off work for up to 14 days. If you've been off work for 15 days, payments are calculated from the first day of your injury but begin after the eighth day.
