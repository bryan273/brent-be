The Camerons' family fortune was built up by his late father, Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in the City.he next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78% turnout, to Davis's 64,398.
