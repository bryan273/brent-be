Next, I went back in time, using the  internet wayback machine , to check what was the P/E ratio and forward P/E ratio of the Russell 2000 each year as reported by the WSJ. I found that every year the index was supposed to have enormous EPS growth.Look at the table below.ote, this high P/E ratio is taking place several years into an expansion, and is not a result of the business cycle being at a low point. Russell Investments, itself, knows how embarrassing this is, by reporting, P/E Ex-Neg Earnings 22.61 on its website (as of June 30th 2015).
