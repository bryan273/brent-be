Clan Guide. The countries and villages of the world of Naruto are only as strong as the clans which inhabit it. Throughout the world unique jutsu abilities are passed down from generation to generation. Some abilities are passed down through genetics (bloodline), while others are skills and abilities only known to those in the clan.
