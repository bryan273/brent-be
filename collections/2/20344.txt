The nucleus in neurons is spherical and ranges in diameter from 3 to 18 micrometers depending on the size of the neuron. Neurons with long axons have a larger cell body and nucleus. As in other cells, the principal component of the nucleus is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the substance of the chromosomes and genes.
