Causes of a detached retina. Retinal detachment usually begins with a retinal tear, or hole in the retina. When a small hole or tear occurs, fluid from the eye can seep into the space between the retina and the back of the eye, which peels the retina away further. When the retina is detached from the back of the eye, it cannot function.
