A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. If you have thrombocytosis caused by a bone marrow disorder (essential thrombocythemia), your bone marrow overproduces the cells that form platelets (megakaryocytes), releasing too many platelets into your blood.
