HEB Coupon Policy Update: Piggybacking Officially Allowed! 1  I have some TERRIFIC news for HEB shoppers -- as of April 6, 2015, we have a new HEB coupon policy, and it actually will make couponing better and easier at HEB grocery stores! I will cover the most important changes to the HEB coupon policy below, but it's really important that you go print a copy of the complete policy for your binder. It can often take time for word of changes to roll out to cashiers, and this way you will be prepared and ready to advocate for yourself at checkout!
