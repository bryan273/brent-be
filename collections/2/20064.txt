All isotopes of radium are highly radioactive, with the most stable isotope being radium-226, which has a half-life of 1600 years and decays into radon gas.When radium decays, ionizing radiation is a product, which can excite fluorescent chemicals and cause radioluminescence.26 Ra is the most stable isotope of radium and is the last isotope in the (4 n + 2) decay chain of uranium-238 with a half-life of over a century. Its immediate decay product is the dense radioactive noble gas radon, which is responsible for much of the danger of environmental radium.
