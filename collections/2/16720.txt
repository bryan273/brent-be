If the rabbits are dead by the time he gets them home though, then my two older cats will eat them-and they are very well fed on cat food, they just like the taste of fresh rabbit. I'd rather they didn't kill wildlife, but at least if they eat it, it hasn't been killed needlessly.he bloodied parts of the rabbit's body was already scattered all over the garden. The rabbit's owners, especially the children, are still in shock and devastated. My question is that I did not realise that firstly a cat would go for a rabbit and secondly a cat would stay around to eat their kill.
