DNA is like the program codes of cells. It tells them what to do in specific situations, contains structral and functional information etc. You can't call a cell living if it doesn't have genetic material (DNA). DNA replication is a preparation for cell division. In a cell, if DNA replicates itself, it's a sign for cell division. There're no other purposes of DNA replication besides cell division (or maybe in some rare cases, endomitosis). All cells in a organism share same DNA with all others (excluding unicell organisms).
