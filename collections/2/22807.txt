The thoracic cavity is coated with a serous membrane, which exudes a thin serum or fluid. This membrane, which contains nerves, blood vessels and lymph channels, covers the lungs as well as parts of the heart, vessels and esophagus. Each lung within the thoracic cavity is contained within a pleural cavity.
