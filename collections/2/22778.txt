Lilo and Stitch’s mission is to catch Stitch’s cousins before they fall into the clutches of the evil Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel and his henchman Gantu, turn the experiments’ natures from bad to good, and find places where each can belong and contribute to the community. See Clips from Lilo & Stitch: The Series. Lilo & Stitch: The Series answers the question: If Stitch was Dr. Jumba’s beloved Experiment 626, what happened to the other 625? Jumba’s remaining experiments have landed all over Hawaii in the form of dehydrated pods. The experiments become activated when submerged in water and, much like Stitch, each experiment has its own specific talents for destruction … and comedy.
