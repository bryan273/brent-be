As a rule pears don't ripen on the tree at all well- they tend to spoil from the inside out. They are -again as a rule- best picked when firm, before they start to fall from the tree, and when the neck is slightly softened. Then, the rule says, they should be refrigerated for at least a couple of weeks.
