EGR engine, the combustion process of the EGR engine must contain the same amount of oxygen molecules. â€¢ Since the EGR engine maintains the same amount of Oxygen and adds inert exhaust gas, the total amount of gas in the combustion chamber increases. This will cause higher peak pressures in the cylinder but will produce the same power.
