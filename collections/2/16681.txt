If the floor is unfinished, add the thickness of the floor covering. For example, if you plan to install 3/4-inch hardwood floors, add 3/4 inches to the measurement. Measure 2 inches under that mark and make another mark for the bottom of a standard 4-inch electrical box. Position the bottom of the box on that mark and fasten it to the stud.
