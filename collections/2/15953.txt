1 Do-it-yourselfers intent on completely refinishing a 225-square-foot floor can rent a commercial sander, also called a drum sander, and buy other needed materials for about $125-$225. 2  Renting a floor buffer and buying needed supplies recoating runs $50-$100.3  These costs go up the longer it takes to finish the project. Expect to pay $340-$900 (about $1.50-$4 a square foot) to completely refinish a 15x15 foot room. 2  That generally includes sanding down to the bare wood and applying at least 2 and sometimes 3 coats of finish.
