As a result, lake circulation reduced drastically. Great Salt Lake now has two distinct sections, the north arm and the south arm. The north arm of Great Salt Lake is so salty that the water is pink in color and salt precipitates onto all surfaces. Sixty-six percent of the fresh water entering the lake is from the Bear, Weber and Jordan Rivers, all of which flow into the south arm. Additional water comes from rain, springs and groundwater.
