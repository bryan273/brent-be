What radium 223 is. Radium 223 is a type of internal radiotherapy treatment. It is a mildly radioactive form of the metal radium. It used to be called Alpharadin and now has the brand name Xofigo (pronounced zoh-fee-go). Doctors use radium 223 to treat prostate cancers that have spread to the bones.nd like calcium active bone cells take up the radium. This makes it a good way of specifically targeting bone cancer cells. Cancer cells are more active than normal bone cells and so are more likely to pick up the radium 223. Once it is in the bones it releases the radiation.
