To reduce discomfort at the injection site, do not inject cold insulin. The insulin container you are currently using can be kept at room temperature. Insulin aspart may be injected in the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the back of the upper arm. Inject this medication under the skin within 5-10 minutes before eating a meal or as directed by your doctor.
