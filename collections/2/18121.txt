Saturn's Cassini Division. Saturn's ring system has gaps throughout it, though only a few of these gaps were known before space probes were able to visit the planet. The largest of these gaps is called the Cassini division, after its French discoverer Jean D. Cassini. It is about 4,800 kilometers wide, although this varies quite a bit around the planet. The gaps are produced by the gravitational pull of one or more of Saturn's many moons on the tiny particles in the rings.
