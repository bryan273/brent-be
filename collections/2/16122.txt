Canadian electricity is cheap at 10 US cents per kilowatt hour, which is reflected in their high average electricity usage. US electricity prices at 0.12 $/kWh are also quite cheap internationally. In India and China they are very cheap. The UK is in the middle at 20 cents. Itâ€™s relatively expensive globally but not too bad for Europe, where most countries pay a high share of tax on their power.
