Cryptogenic cirrhosis is a condition that impairs liver function. People with this condition develop irreversible liver disease caused by scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), typically in mid- to late adulthood. The liver is a part of the digestive system that helps break down food, store energy, and remove waste products, including toxins.
