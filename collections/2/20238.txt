Best Answer: All DVD players play MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video and AC-3 or PCM (eg, WAV) audio... virtually all of them will also play MPEG Layer 2 audio. HOWEVER, it's not guaranteed that you can simply drop an MPEG-2 file on a DVD-R and have your player handle it. Some will, but not all of them. The formal DVD-Video format is what every DVD player plays, and that's something you can generate only using a DVD Authoring program.
