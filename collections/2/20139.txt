Try to stick with paths/shapes/curves/smart objects/unflattened text so that you can scale things up later if you need to make them bigger. There is no hard and fast rule on logo size. I would recommend you create something a few times larger than what you want to be displayed on the web. Say using 600 X 600. Have it as your master copy. When generating a copy for the web, resize it to a smaller one e.g. 100 X 100; then use the Photoshop's 'save for web or devices' function to output the actual web copy.
