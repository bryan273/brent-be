The origin of flash and flashing are uncertain but these words are related to a pool of water and the word splash. Usage may come from Middle English between 1350â€“1400 ...flasshen to sprinkle, splash [compare with] flask .... Dictionary quotes refer to lead as the material used as a flash. Counter-flashing (cover flashing, cap flashing) is when there are two parallel pieces of flashing used together such as on a chimney where counter-flashing is built into a chimney and overlaps a replaceable piece of base flashing.
