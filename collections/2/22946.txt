Wondering how to make propane special effects? Propane special effects are often used in concerts, movies or events. One way to use propane as a special effect is setting a metal dish mounted on a metal to form a flame dish or on metal tube to form flame bars which can also be placed just below water to make flame on water effect. There are other flame effects which are bigger in scale and are commonly seen in concerts or events however these set up are risky and require a licensed pyrotechnic.
