Nissan Versa. About Nissan Versa. It used to be that a car's low price came at the expense of creature comforts. But that's not the case for the 2017 Nissan Versa. At a starting price of less than $13,000 including destination charges, the basic Versa S still comes with air conditioning and a 4-speaker audio system with Bluetooth connectivity.
