I was started on Neurontin about 5 days ago. For the past 3 days now I have had extreme diarrhea and incontinence. This is very embarrassing and has kept me house bound for 3 days now. There is nothing solid coming out despite the solid diet I am eating (BRAT diet.) It is all yellow water. I have severe stomach pain and a low grade fever, about 99.8.
