Ervin is a lover. He is loyal until the end. He believes in what is just and fair fighting for it when opportunities arise. His sweet spirit is caring but not apologetic. He lacks sympathy for stupidity and believes people get what they deserve. For him hard work will pay off, but staying motivated can be most of the task.
