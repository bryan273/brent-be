Cabbage is ready for harvest when the heads are firm. Cabbage is a cool-weather vegetable that thrives in the garden. A cabbage plant takes anywhere from 80 to 180 days to mature. In addition to the time frame, the tight cabbage heads offer signs of maturity to let you know when to harvest the vegetable. With proper harvesting techniques, you are able to allow for a second smaller growth of cabbage sprouts to harvest later.
