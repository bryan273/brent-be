Types of grief. Grief comes at different points along the journey of loss, but the primary points are the period that begins at diagnosis and the period that begins at the death of a loved one. From the point of diagnosis to death, there are two types of grief: preparatory and anticipatory. Preparatory grief is experienced by the person who is ill as they grieve the loss of their health, independence, and the shortened time they will have with others.
