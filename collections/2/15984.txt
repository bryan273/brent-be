Consolidation is a neurological process that involves gradually converting information from short-term memory into long-term memory. Remember, short-term memories are only stored for about 20 to 30 seconds. In order to be retained so that the information can be retrieved and used later, the contents of short-term memory must be moved into long-term memory. Long-term potentiation is a process in which synapses become stronger the more frequently signals are passed between two neurons. This mechanism is believed to play a major role in the learning and memory processes.
