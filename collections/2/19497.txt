They all, like this one, are quiet and have a nice view of the water. At Blue Bluff there are concrete pads with picnic tables, water and electrical hook ups. The road is narrow coming in and larger rigs need to choose your site wisely for back-in. We have a 40 Motorhome and had room to back in and park the car. Love these COE parks. - mmhailey.
