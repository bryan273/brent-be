Best Answer: Its not in your computer , it is a seperate device that connects to your internet service.... its role is to provide wireless access to your internet connection.... the SSID is the name of the router. the WEP key if any is like a password uded to connect to it... If you have a WIFI card in your computer then you can go to the network connections in the control panel and then go to the wifi card to do a search for availalbe networks... The router is outside the computer. Your default gateway is the IP address of the router. Your SSID and the WEP key can be found in the properties of your wireless network interface. Unless you have subscribed to broadband, then installed a wireless router, configured it and connected it to your line, you have no router. It is not part of your computer.
