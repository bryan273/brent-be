NEVER leave the hearing range of the pressure cooker while beans are cooking. Never fill the cooker over 2/3 full, counting both beans and water. This means a standard 6 quart pressure cooker can cook up about 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of dried beans (3 cups of dried beans) at one time, provided they are soaked.
