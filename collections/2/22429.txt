If you lead a normal, healthy life, a life insurance medical exam blood test is nothing to worry about. Make sure to drink plenty of water in the 24 hours before the test so the blood draw is not too difficult, but not so much that your urine is overly diluted, as it may be disqualified (you would just have to pee in a cup again for a second test).
