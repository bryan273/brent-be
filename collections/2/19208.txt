Directions: For both the liquid and solid ant baits, you want to mix the borax or boric acid into the sugary bait in a 1 to 3 ratio. I used maple syrup for the liquid bait, but honey would work just as well. Microwave the syrup (I used 3/4 C) for a few seconds until warm.Then mix in your borax or boric acid (I used 1/4 C).or ants in the garden: If you have ants in your garden, do NOT drop the ant bait directly onto the soil ! Borax and boric acid can act as herbicides and may harm your plants! Put the mixtures on tupperware lids and set those in your garden instead.
