Children-after one year and 20 pounds. Missouri law requires all children under the age of 4 to be secured in an approved child safety seat and all children under 16 to be properly restrained in a motor vehicle. Children over one year and at least 20 pounds may ride in a forward facing child safety seat. The safest position in the vehicle is the back seat. Never place a child safety seat in front of an air bag. Be sure your child safety seat is securely fastened in the car, and that your child is securely fastened in the safety seat.
