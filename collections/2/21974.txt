By 2011 the situation had reversed, and once again Toronto and Ontario homes cost more than in Calgary and Alberta. House price rises have been modest in Canada in 2011 and 2012, partly due to new, stricter mortgage rules that have been introduced. In 2013 and 214 house prices have risen steadily in Vancouver and Toronto. In 2015 house prices in British Columbia have continued to rise above the national average. Ontario is also experiencing steady price rises. In Alberta house prices are falling.
