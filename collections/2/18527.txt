A blood platelet count — Doctors always order this test first. ITP is one of the causes of a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Blood tests — Several different blood tests may be done, including a test for the presence of antiplatelet antibodies. A blood smear — In this test, a drop of blood is smeared on a glass slide so that the size, shape and general appearance of the platelets and other blood cells can be checked under a microscope.
