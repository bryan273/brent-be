The junction between glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle is the formation of Acetyl-CoA. The Acetyl-CoA combines with oxaclacetic acid to begin the cycle. This process occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The Electron Transport Chain: is made of electron carrier molecules embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
