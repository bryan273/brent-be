At an MSRP of $11,990, the Nissan Versa is the cheapest new car money can buy. Next in line is the Chevrolet Spark, which starts at $13,000. Other rivals cost a bit more, like the Kia Rio at $14,165. Brand loyalists will have to shell out an extra $5,000 to upgrade to the Sentra, Nissan's compact car. The Versa sedan comes in five trims: S, S Plus, SV, SV Special Edition, and SL.
