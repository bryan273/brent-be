Onions and Soil pH. Onions, like most veggies, grow best in slightly acidic soil. Ideally, soil for onions should have a pH level of 5.5 to 6.5, according to the National Gardening Association. At the high end of this range, soil nutrients are most easily accessed. While onions can survive when grown at a different pH level, they won't grow particularly well.
