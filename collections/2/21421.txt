Sleeping bags can reduce the risk of SIDS. A safe sleeping bag is made in such a way that the baby cannot slip inside the bag and become completely covered. Sleeping bags can prevent legs from dangling out of the cot rails. Babies in sleeping bags can be positioned anywhere in the cot if no extra bedding is used.
