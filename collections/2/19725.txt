Now, following the above steps: 1  The parent hydrocarbon chain has 23 carbons. It is called tricosa-. 2  The functional groups with the highest precedence are the two ketone groups. The groups are on carbon atoms 3 and 9. 3  The side chains are: an ethyl- at carbon 4, an ethyl- at carbon 8, and a butyl- at carbon 12.
