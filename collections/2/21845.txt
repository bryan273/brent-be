I have tried choosing custom installation and unchecking NVIDIA Update, but that does not work. Also, I have tried uninstalling NVIDIA update from Programs and features in Control Panel, but that won't remove the UpdatusUser account. I have also created a post in the NVIDIA forums that contains more images and details: here (please look at the screenshots there), but I didn't get a solution to my problem.
