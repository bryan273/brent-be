I have problems taking care of myself, I am 45 yrs old. And noticed that when I drive my lower rt leg and foot shake bad too. I do noticed that when I am sitting down and hand is at rest it does shake but I started rollin my index finger with the tip of my thumb and my tremors wld stop but when I stop doin that it wld shake again.
