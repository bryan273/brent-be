How to access mental health services. Mental health, emotional wellbeing and resilience is all about how we cope with what life throws at us. It concerns the way we feel about ourselves, conduct relationships, handle stress or deal with loss.ental health services are free on the NHS, but you will usually need a referral from your GP to access them. There are some mental health services that will allow people to refer themselves for help. This commonly includes services for drug and alcohol problems, as well as some psychological therapy services.
