1 Some people have their mail sent to a post office box, rather than a street address. 2  If this is the case for your recipient, write the correct post office box number followed by the city, state and country if applicable. 3  Write each part of the address on a different line to make it more legible. If you have a scale at home, you can weigh and measure your letter to determine how much postage you'll need to pay. 2  Record the measurements, then check usps.gov for rates. 3  Affix as many stamps as you need to the top right corner of your letter.
