Corn will germinate and emerge slowly and unevenly when soil temperatures are less than 50 degrees F. Thermal time from planting to emergence is approximately 115 growing degree days (GDDs) based on air temperature or about 119 GDDs based on soil temperature using the modified growing degree formula (Nielsen, 2008).
