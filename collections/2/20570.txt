Heroes of the Storm is a new online game under development by Blizzard. The developer refers to Heroes of the Storm as a Hero Brawler, not a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) like Dota 2 or an Action RTS like League of Legends. Blizzard's aim with Heroes of the Storm is to create a unique brawler focusing on teamwork and playing with your team.
