Longitude is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and is used to describe the location of a place on Earth east or west of the zero or prime meridian. In 1884, the International Meridian Conference adopted the Greenwich Meridian as the universal prime meridian or zero point of longitude.
