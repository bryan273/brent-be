Almost any type of cancer can cause a pleural effusion if it is present in or spreads (metastasizes) to the chest area. The most common are breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and some types of leukemias and lymphomas. A pleural effusion may also be caused by the treatments for lung cancer, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
