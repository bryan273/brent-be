So, I suggest it should only be the medallions that: 1  were flown itself (excluding Robbins, Fliteline and similar medals) 2  are minted with flown material. 3  are minted with un-flown, but exceptional material (such as spare pieces of some space probe, a piece of a launch pad, etc.) 4  other similarly rare/unique medals.
