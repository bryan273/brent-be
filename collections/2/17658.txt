Can I talk with my anesthesiologist before surgery? You will meet your anesthesiologist the day of the operation before surgery. If you have any questions or concerns related to your anesthesia, you are welcome to contact the Department of Anesthesiology to arrange for a pre-anesthesia consultation.
