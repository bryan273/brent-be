The ureters, bladder, and urethra move urine from the kidneys and store it until releasing it from the body. The amount of urine a person produces depends on many factors, such as the amounts of liquid and food a person consumes and the amount of fluid lost through sweat and breathing. Certain medications, medical conditions, and types of food can also affect the amount of urine produced. Children produce less urine than adults; the amount produced depends on their age. Points to Remember The urinary tract is the bodyâ€™s drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid.
