For pure essential oils, add one drop in 2.5 mL (or 1/2 teaspoon) of vegetable oil and apply it to your arm. If the area turns red, or if there is burning or itchiness, wash the area and do not use that product. Overuse of essential oils can trigger a headache or dizziness. Don't exceed recommended amounts.
