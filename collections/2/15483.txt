With warm soils and the weather staying dry, there isn't much risk to soybean seed planted 2-2.5 in. If seeds need to be 3 in. deep to get to enough moisture, it is likely that, due to uneven soil moisture, some parts of the field will not come up until it rains due to uneven soil moisture and (probably) seed placement.
