1 These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year. 2  If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true-i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** - then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year. The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate 2  .*.
