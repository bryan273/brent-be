So, if you sold mutual fund shares in 2014 and there is no cost basis (gain or loss) information on Form 1099-B for that sale, it i s because the shares you sold were most likely acquired before 2012.or purposes of your 2014 Form 1099-B, cost basis information needs to be reported only for those mutual fund shares acquired and sold aft er January 1, 2012.Example: To continue our example, suppose Chris bought the mutual fund shares in early 2012 and redeemed them at the end of 2014.
