Many dragons take a while to learn to eat their veggies. Some have suggested putting in a large leaf--attach it to something (e.g., with a paper clamp) so they can pull on it to tear off a piece. I've suggested: 1  putting the greens in a very shallow bowl so they can see them (particularly for babies: if they can't see them, they won't go to eat them), 2  misting them,
