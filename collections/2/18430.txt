Cross linking is a stabilization process in polymer chemistry which leads to. multidimensional extension of polymeric chain resulting in network structure. Cross-link is a bond which links one polymer. chain to other. It can be ionic or covalent. Cross linking changes a liquid polymer into ‘solid’ or ‘gel’ by restricting the ability. of movement. When polymer chains are linked together by cross-links, they lose some of their ability to move as individual. polymer chains.
