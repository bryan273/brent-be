About Ottawa County. This web site is provided by Kathy Bowling, County Treasurer. Our goal is to provide additional payment options to taxpayers and greater access to public information -- 24 hours a day, 7 days a week -- all without the inconvenience or expense of a trip to the courthouse. We are continually working to improve the website.
