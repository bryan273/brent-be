The Latin phrase E Pluribus Unum is found in the Journals of the Continental Congress, June 20, 1782, where it was used to describe the Great Seal adopted that day (1). From the Great Seal's earliest depiction (2), E Pluribus Unum has appeared on coins since 1795 (3) and has graced the back of $1 notes (4) since 1935. The phrase has been required on all U.S. coinage by law since February 12, 1873 (5).
