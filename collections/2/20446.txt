Fossil fuels are made from the remains of ancient organisms that were buried under many layers of sediment millions of years ago. With increased heat and pressure, fossils are turned into fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are found in sedimentary rock, which is often located beneath a body or former body of water such as an ocean or swamp. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources that include oil, natural gas, and coal.
