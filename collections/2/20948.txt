Italics do not have any hard-and-fast grammar rules that apply to all the major standard style guides. 1  Whenever you are writing a piece, consult the specific style guide that applies to ensure the proper use of italics, as each style guide may have a slightly different preference or rule. There are four main style guides that apply in a variety of professional writing situations: 1  The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual. 2  MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers. 3  Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. 4  Chicago Manual of Style of Style.
