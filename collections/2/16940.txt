Depends on the beer bc they will all have different densities. But for shipping in my liquor store a 750ml of wine is 4-5lbs lower for wine, higher for champagne bc of the extra glass. 1.5 liters of wine are 7-8 lbs. Since beers use a bit thicker glass in that format (usually) a guess of 4.5 lbs should be conservative enough. I took pictures so you can see for yourself.
