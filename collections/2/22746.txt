In simple terms, biology is the study of life. Modern biologists draw on chemistry, geology, mathematics and physics to explain how living things adapt, develop and grow within their natural environments, according to Muskegon Community College. Biologists then draw conclusions of how organisms reproduce themselves and pass on genetic traits.
