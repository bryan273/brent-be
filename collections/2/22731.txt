I agree with this article. Although 6 hours a night is optimal for me, I have made it off of 4 a night for several weeks at a time. It’s amazing how our bodies get used to it. I have also slept 8 hours a night for a couple of nights but I can’t seem to do it every night because my body only needs 5 to 6.
