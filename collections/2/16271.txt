What is parenteral nutrition? Parenteral nutrition (PN) gives your body nutrients when you are not able to eat or cannot absorb nutrition from the food you eat. PN is given through an IV catheter (thin tube) placed in a vein in your arm, upper chest, or neck. PN provides you with water, protein, sugar, fats, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes.
