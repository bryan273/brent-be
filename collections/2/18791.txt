Posted May 5, 2012 4:35pm. Without knowing when you filed for your homestead tax exemption, I can't answer your question specifically. According to HCAD's (Harris County Appraisal District) website, you must mail your homestead application between January 1 and April 30th. They do not accept early applications.
