Lactase is an enzyme produced by many organisms. It is located in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals. Lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk; it breaks down lactose, a sugar which gives milk its sweetness.Lacking lactase, a person consuming dairy products may experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance.he optimum temperature for human lactase is about 37°C for its activity and has an optimum pH of 6. In metabolism, the β -glycosidic bond in D-lactose is hydrolyzed to form D-galactose and D-glucose, which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream.
