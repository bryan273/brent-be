Being a horticulturist has let Randall work outdoors and be in a casual environment, but what he loves the most is that horticulture has let him see into a secret world. I used to walk down the street and just see trees.t's a laid-back industry, Randall grins. Most people are there because they're passionate about plants. It's not really a career you do for money.. This passion for plants is particularly important in the area of native plants, where some local species are becoming threatened by imported flora.
