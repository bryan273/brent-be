Mauville City. After you drop off the Devon Goods in Slateport and go north through Route 110, you reach Mauville City, home to the next Gym. Explore. Go east from the entrance and walk behind the fence to reach the hidden X Speed. Go into the house north of there and talk to the guy at the table to get HM06 Rock Smash. After you get the Gym Badge from Mauville Gym, you will be able to use Rock Smash outside of battle. This will allow you break some types of rocks that are blocking your path. In addition, sometimes Rock Smash causes a wild pokémon to appear. Go west and enter the house next to the Poké Mart.
