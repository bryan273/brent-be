What bothers me the most is if you are going to write a check to the store, why don’t you at least have the date, the name of the store and your signature on the check before you get in line and for my sake, stay out of the express lane !!! says: October 18, 2011 at 2:30 pm. I write checks at all stores.t makes no sense to me either. I know my parents (both in their 70’s) will not use a debit card. They think that it gives people access to their bank account and someone will steal all of their money. So, maybe old people just don’t trust the debit card idea.
