(December 2009). The Cleric, Priest, or Bishop is a character class in Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy role-playing games. The cleric is a healer, usually a priest and a holy warrior, originally modeled on or inspired by the Military Orders. In Dragon Nest, The Cleric is one of the five classes that a player may choose at the start of the game. 2  The Cleric's role in the game is mainly to support its party, as it possesses skills that heal and buff team mates. 3  Their role further branches out to Paladins and Priests, available as secondary classes at level 15.
