Harvesting Your Cabbage. About 8 to 10 weeks after planting, your cabbage will be ready to pick. (It may take a little longer if planted in the fall in the far southern states.) You can harvest your cabbage anytime after the head has formed. Sometimes the cabbage head looks ready but isnâ€™t. Squeeze the head to see.
