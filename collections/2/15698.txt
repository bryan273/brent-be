A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly blocked or cut off (called an ischemic stroke) or when blood vessels in the brain suddenly burst (called a hemorrhagic stroke). These traumatic events interrupt the flow of oxygen to the brain and cause brain cells to die off rapidly.
