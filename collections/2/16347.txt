A warm compress can help relax the muscles around your eyes. This can help relieve that tired feeling. To make a simple compress, moisten a clean washcloth or a few clean paper towels with warm (but not hot) water. Lay the cloth over your eyes for a few minutes until you feel soothed. You can also make a warm compress with a tea bag. Steep the bag in some warm water, then squeeze the excess from the tea bag.
