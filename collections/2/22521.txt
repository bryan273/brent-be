DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar, electronic piano, or electric bass to a mixing consoleâ€™s microphone input. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance bridging to minimize noise, distortion, and ground loops. DIs do not perform impedance matching.
