Clear Airway Apnea = Central Apnea? I recently got a Respironics System One Auto machine, and I notice that in the daily report, AHI is composed of three things – Obstructive Airway Apneas (OA), Hyponeas (H), and Clear Airway Apneas (CA). My first question is this – is Clear Airway Apnea just another term for Central Apnea?
