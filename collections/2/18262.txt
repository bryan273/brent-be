If you or a loved one is experiencing any of these symptoms, consult a doctor and request the proper blood and urine tests. Some of these symptoms may be related to conditions other than kidney disease, but only a doctor can provide a diagnosis after seeing your test results. Because your kidneys are tasked with making urine, and thereby eliminating waste, any changes in the frequency, color, or appearance of urine should be taken seriously.
