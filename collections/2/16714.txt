I live in the country and there are tons of rabbits. My cat hunts them and eats them. It's really sad for the poor rabbits. When cats are kittens their mothers have to teach them how to hunt within 2 weeks of age or else they will not hunt at all.If they do teach them to hunt within this time period than the cat will hunt for the rest of their life and you can't stop that.hat way the cat can think of it as hunting. Indoor cats are said to live twice as long, on the average, as outdoor cats. There are many reasons why it is better and safer for your cat to stay indoors. An added bonus is no more dead rabbit presents.
