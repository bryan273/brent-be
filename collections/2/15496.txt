2. Body Scrub. Take a bottle of coconut oil into the bath or shower with you and use it as a body scrub. You can use it as is or mix the coconut oil together with an equal amount of sugar or baking soda to turn it into an exfoliating experience. Gently scrub your body with it to remove rough and flaky, dry skin.
