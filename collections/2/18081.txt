From early jazz styles through the era of swing music, the clarinet was one of the most prominent instruments in jazz. Today the clarinet is not as common in jazz, but when it is included it gets special attention given its warm, round tone. A part of the woodwind family, the clarinet can be made of wood or plastic, and its tone is produced when the reed on the mouthpiece vibrates.
