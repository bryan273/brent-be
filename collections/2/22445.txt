Yes, certainly in my Blackberry 8110 there are - however it's just the magnets in the built in speakers, nothing to do with the fact it's a phone. Powerful enough to stick 1p â€¦ coins to it though! Any speaker from anything will have a magnet in it. If you take apart most cell phones you'll find the speaker is super tiny, so the magnet inside is also tiny. Some types of microphones also use magnets, but not all.
