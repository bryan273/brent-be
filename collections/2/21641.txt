And that's what happens if you try to use the power rule, the product rule and the chain rule to differentiate u/v. The second way to differentiate u / v is to use the quotient rule, which has this nice little jingle: Low d hi minus hi d low, all over the square of what's below. Here, u is the high and v is the low, so y` = (vu` - uv`) / v ^2, and you end up with the same equation for y` .
