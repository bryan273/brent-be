Hair on the scalp grows about half a millimeter a day - about 6 inches per year. Unlike other mammals, hair growth and loss is random and not seasonal or cyclical. Hairs are in various stages of growth and shedding at any given time. There are three stages of hair growth: catagen, anagen and telogen.
