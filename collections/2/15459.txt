There's mention of the yellow agents, carotene and xanthophyll. They bring up the cooler nights and bright sunshine of autumn days as causes for chemical changes which result in color changes. There's usually even mention of the red pigments, anthocyanins, formed when natural sugar, glucose, is trapped in a dying leaf. Oh yes, no scientific discussion of the leaves of autumn would be complete without mention of abscission. This is what gives the term fall meaning.
