Golden Spike National Historic Site. The first thing you’ll notice when you get to the rail line of the Golden Spike National Historic Site, west of Brigham City, Utah, and just north of the Great Salt Lake is the silence. With the midday sun high overhead the only sound you’ll hear is the wind coming down from the Promontory Mountains.
