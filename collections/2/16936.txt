Note that this is not a comprehensive database of all agricultural land transactions and that the percentage of all transactions captured may vary regionally and annually. Only tracts 40 acres in size or larger selling for $3,000 per acre or less are included in the averages through 2007. Beginning in 2008, the market ceiling was increased to $6000 reflective of higher Oklahoma agricultural real estate values that have occurred over time. Per acre values shown for cropland and pasture are the averages of tracts having 85%+ cropland and pasture, respectively. Because of unavoidable data collection difficulties, relatively less land sale data is available for 1995 and 1996.
