Yes and no. If there are signs of a serious infection, take your dog to the vet and make sure everything clears out okay. If itâ€™s run-of-the-mill gunk (everyone gets sleepies now and again!), there are special drops for dogs, or you can take a clean, damp towel and gently remove the build-up around the eyes.
