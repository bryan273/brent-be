Recently, I have become fascinated with the many ways in which racism is being used in our society today. No, not the actual instances of racism, but rather how the word or accusation of racism is thrown around by our politicians. Also, it seems as if it is mostly used by the liberals. Originally, racism was used by politicians to mean that same thing as its literal definition: hating someone because of their race. But that has all changed; at least 95 percent of the time racism is now used to mean something else.
