The FD-ID structure measures price change for goods, services, and construction sold to final demand and to intermediate demand. FD-ID indexes are constructed from commodity-based producer output price indexes. Final demand measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export. The final demand goods index measures price change for both unprocessed and processed goods sold to final demand.
