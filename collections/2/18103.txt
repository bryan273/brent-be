Before having your wisdom teeth removed, you'll be given an injection of local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and surrounding area. If you're particularly anxious about the procedure, your dentist or surgeon may give you a sedative to help you relax. This usually involves an injection into your arm.urgery to remove wisdom teeth shouldn't be painful, because the area will be numb. However, if you feel pain during the procedure, tell your dentist or oral surgeon so they can give you more anaesthetic. How long it takes to remove the tooth will vary.
