Sawflies are a small non-stinging wasp and their young are  larvae, which is the only life stage that does any damage. Sawfly larvae are small and caterpillar like in their appearance, although they are not true caterpillars. They feed on a wide range of plants and they cause the most damage to younger plant specimens.
