Even after a long briefing with the company, I still don’t know how it works. One explanation said that I should view it as a multidimensional QAM. Here is what MagnaCom’s release said about WAM: “WAM technology is a pure digital new modulation scheme, using spectral compression that improves spectral efficiency.The spectral compression enables an increase in the signaling rate thereby affording the use of lower order alphabet, which reduces complexity.ave modulation, the term seems to be intuitively misleading, like the carrier is a WAVE that is undergoing MODULATION. The term doesn't imply anything revealing to its nature. Maybe we can derive the nature of this WAM scheme from the benefits it gives or from some of the descriptions.
