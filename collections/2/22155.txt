A really good way of making gold in WoW in Mists of Pandaria is by selling Battle Pets. Many of these drop in old world raids and instances now like Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, Blackrock Spire and Ahn’Quiraj.n my server these pets sell for 2000 – 20000g + and this is on top of all the other items you would get from farming Molten Core or any other zone in the first place. So where do you buy pet cages? You don’t even need to do that, there is no Pet Cage Vendor like some people believe.
