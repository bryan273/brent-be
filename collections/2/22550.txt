The Synergy and Summit plans are based on a coordinated care model (CCM) using the more focused Synergy and Summit networks, each focusing on different counties in Oregon (see questions #2 and #3 for list of counties), while a statewide PPO plan uses the wider Connexus network and does not connect you to a specific clinic to manage your care.
