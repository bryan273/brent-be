There's a new launch company (called SpaceX) that is developing their own rockets (called the Falcon). They will be able to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) for about 6 million dollars. That is about as cheap as it gets.To send the Mars rovers on a Delta-II booster (rocket) cost well over 10 million, each.est Answer: You have to bear in mind that the cost to get humans into space is astronomical compared with unmanned probes. A misunderstanding of this is why a lot of people can't understand why we have not been back to the moon, or why we have not sent humans beyond Earth's orbit at all since 1972.
