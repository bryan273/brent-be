Quads pulls are a common but effective dynamic stretch for your quads. Stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointed forward. Lift one leg up towards your glutes. As you lift your leg, reach back and grab your ankle with your opposite hand. Pull your ankle towards your glutes until you feel a stretch in your quad, and hold this position for two seconds. Slowly lower your leg, and repeat this stretch with your opposite leg and opposite hand.
