They claim they gurantee replacement but thats complete and total crap! I bought a house through an FHA loan and with in 4 weeks we had a storm come through and the roof has a bunch of shingles damaged and i have interior damage from the storm. I have had Erie insurance for over 18yrs and never a claim until this one. Now going on 8 moths with zero help from Erie!
