asked May 31, 2012 in Conditions and Treatments by anonymous retagged Jun 4, 2012 by LarryEitel. Before being admitted to the hospital for a UTI my 85 year old grandmother had been living with a hemoglobin level of about 8, now she has been in for 7 days and we cannot keep it up above 7.5 because she has two ulcers. She is weak now from not getting out of bed. What can we do for her besides giving blood.
