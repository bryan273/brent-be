Wrapping It Up. The name of a computer might be a small thing, but that doesn’t make it any less important. And while the automatically assigned system names are good enough, they are hardly intuitive. But thanks to the ever customizable Windows 10, you can change your computer’s name to whatever you like.croll all the way down, and click About. Now move to the right pane and click the Rename PC button. Once you do that, a pop-up box will come up, asking you to enter the new computer name. Enter the name, and hit Next.
