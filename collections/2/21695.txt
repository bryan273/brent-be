The money reimbursed through a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account will reduce the amount of eligible expenses you can use for the tax credit on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Tax savings with a Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account become more valuable as your income increases. Generally, if your family's adjusted gross income is less than $39,000 a year, it's best for you to take the tax credit rather than participating in the DCA.
