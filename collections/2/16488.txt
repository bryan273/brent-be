My husband is 6’5 and I’m a meesily 5’1 and he hates it when I curl up in the middle of the bed. Either with my cold feet on him or half of my body on his side and he has to have up to his knees off the bed just so he doesn’t suffocate me with the blankets lol. Drives him nuts and he gets like such a baby about it.
