Chinese cabbage, also known as celery cabbage and Wong Bok, has been cultivated in China since 500 A.D. Its name is a bit misleading because the crop looks more like turnips and swedes than cabbage. It prefers cool seasons, and grows best in fall and winter. Chinese cabbage matures faster than regular cabbage and may take as little as 60 to 65 days from seeding to harvest. The three varieties are Jade Pagoda Hybrid, China Pride Hybrid and Blues Hybrid.
