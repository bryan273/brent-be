The Soviet attack on Finland in November 1939, followed by Stalin s absorption of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1940, further exacerbated relations. The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, however, led to changes in American attitudes. The United States began to see the Soviet Union as an embattled country being overrun by fascist forces, and this attitude was further reinforced in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
