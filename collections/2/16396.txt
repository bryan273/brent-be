When coated paperboard is printed, pressed into a groove with a creasing rule and folded, white line cracking occurs along the crease due to intensive mechanical pressure. The cracking will deteriorates product quality and waste resources. Effects of creasing pressure and ink dosage on the foldability of coated board were investigated. It was shown that applying an optimum pressure is important during creasing. When the pressure was too low, the crease formed was not sufficiently deep enough to enable precise folding. When an excess pressure was applied, fiber bonding was destroyed, resulted in unsatisfactory cracking.
