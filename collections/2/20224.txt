Instead of looking at just one of those metrics, our pick is based on a balance of realistic capacity and cycle life combined with a fair price. Despite their lack of superlative performance claims, the Energizer Recharge Power Plus batteries performed well at each step of testing. We measured an average capacity of 2,126 mAh in controlled bench tests and they finished in a four-way tie in our real-world flashlight tests with a burn time of about three hours.
