Bae is 25th in the International team standings but could jump up with strong performances this week and next before the top 10 is finalized and Price makes his two Captain’s picks. He has certainly made a statement with his play this week. Bae took advantage of favorable conditions Saturday at Plainfield, making nine birdies, including four in his last five holes, and two bogeys on his way to matching Day and Justin Rose for the second-best score of the day behind only Carlos Ortiz’s 62.
