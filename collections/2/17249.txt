Some places won’t take cats because they can be hard to manage. It’s that whole claw thing. Petco will do a full groom, or just trim the claws. It is where I take my cat. I think a full groom is $ 38, a nail trim is just $ 8, which is cheaper than the vet. The yellow pages is a good place to start. I would check out the groomers before I left my cat, see if you could chat up another cat customer.
