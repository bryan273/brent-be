I've known more than a few to be surprised to find their Aquarius had other friends.. For some that's just spreading the love around -- but if it's not your understanding, that leads to quite a shock. The Aquarius man can be a trendsetter, an absent-minded Professor type, a quirky genius, and much more.He's progressive by nature, but is known to have stubborn opinions. This makes sense when you consider the co-ruler, Saturn, and his love of structure and order.he Aquarius man is a thinker, and loves to be stimulated by the unexpected. He's drawn to your eccentricities and original opinions, so don't hold back. Born under the planet of shocks and futuristic thinking (Uranus), he's bound to have some ideas that seem out there..
