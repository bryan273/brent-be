Still, I want to make my list, get into the grocery store, and then get out in less than 30 minutes at all times. To do this, I use a mix of automated delivery, a simple tactic for meal planning, and a few tricks inside the store itself.hen I'm at the store, I'm careful not to do any of the stupid things we all do while shopping. In the grocery store, this is a big deal. Brand loyalty is easy to get caught up in, and advertising is everywhere. I regularly remind myself of these tricks to avoid the most common marketing tricks.
