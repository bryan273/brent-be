The core theme of biology is evolution. This theme looks at the way organisms adapt to the environment to improve survival odds. All life on the planet exists because it evolves to best fit the environmental conditions, and those who adapt best, pass on those characteristics to their offspring. If a species does not adapt or evolve, it dies.
