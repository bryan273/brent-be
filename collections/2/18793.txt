What It Does. The homestead exemption allows you to save on property taxes by allowing you to exclude a portion of your home's value from assessment. The amount of tax you owe is calculated based on the difference between your home's value and the exemption amount. For example, if your home is valued at $250,000 and your state allows a homestead exemption of $25,000, you would only pay taxes on the remaining $225,000. Depending on the amount of the exemption allowed in your state, you could potentially shave hundreds of dollars off your tax bill each year.
