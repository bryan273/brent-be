A propane tank explosion is a type of BLEVE, or Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion. This type of explosion occurs when the pressure in the tank exceeds that which it can safely vent. Eventually, rising pressure will cause the tank to rupture and burst. Cause. A propane BLEVE occurs mainly when it is exposed to high temperatures, like a fire. The temperature heats the liquid propane inside the tank, causing it to expand to a point that the stress it places on the tank becomes too high. When propane gas leaks from the tank in a fire, it will ignite and can cause an explosion. Relief Valve. All propane tanks are equipped with a relief valve. When the pressure inside a tank rises, the relief valve opens and starts venting gas to bring the pressure down.
