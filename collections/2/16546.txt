It’s one of the most exclusive NYC events, and one of the biggest fundraising nights as well. In 2014, the Gala reached an all-time high $12 million. The annual Met Gala goes along with the theme of that year’s Costume Institute exhibition, and guests are expected to dress according to said theme. The exhibit then runs for the next few months.
