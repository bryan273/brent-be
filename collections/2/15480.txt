Under ideal soil temperature and moisture conditions corn will emerge in 7 to 10 days. Uneven soil temperature in the seed zone can be caused by variable soil texture, soil color, soil drainage, surface residue cover and seeding depth. Dark-colored soils will typically warm more quickly than light-colored soils.
