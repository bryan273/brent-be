The Cutoff Time is there to help you! It means you only have a few seconds to answer each question. At first it seems hard, but as you start to remember you get better and better. And at high speed you get lots of practice. (Without the cutoff time you can count to get each answer and never truly learn your tables.). Choose 4 seconds for best effect.
