These plants provide food and shelter for a huge variety of animals. Rainforests are divided into four layers, or storeys: emergent layer, canopy, understorey, and forest floor. Each layer receives a different amount of sunlight and rainfall, so different types of animals and plants are found in each layer. Tropical rainforests cover seven per cent of the Earth's land, but are home to over half the world's plants and animals.
