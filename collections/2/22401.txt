A person who suspects a problem should go to a primary care doctor (pediatrician, internist, or family physician) first for evaluation. The primary care doctor may run some tests. If the doctor suspects seizures, the person probably will be referred to a neurologist, a doctor with special training in disorders of the brain, including epilepsy. Some neurologists have specific training in epilepsy and spend most of their time treating people with this disorder; they are called epileptologists.
