Here's the primary difference between these two types of home loans: A conventional mortgage product is originated in the private sector, and is not insured by the government. An FHA loan is also originated in the private sector, but it gets insured by the government through the Federal Housing Administration. This insurance protects the lender, not the borrower. A conventional mortgage loan can also be insured.
