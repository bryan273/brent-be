NPO before surgery is nonsense. .....or, maybe it isn't. I figured I'd ask those of you that know. How long does it take for a couple of ounces of water to be absorbed? what is the possible hazard of a pt drinking a little water a couple hours prior to surgery? As an ER nurse, I keep my pt's NPO when ordered, but don't really know why. I get why they shouldn't have a cheeseburger and milkshake, but ice chips?
