Prices for the Tata Tiago start at Rs 3.21 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Bearing this price in mind, we have to say that the Tiago, is Tataâ€™s best foot forward yet. It does leave you wanting in the performance department but if you are looking for a hatchback that is trendy, has loads of features and ample amount of space, the Tiago fits the bill nicely.
