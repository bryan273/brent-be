GAUGE MANIFOLD SET. One of the most important tools to the HVAC&R technician is the gauge manifold set. The compound gauge (blue) and the high pressure gauge (red) are connected to the manifold, and the manifold is then connected by hoses to access ports to measure system pressures. The compound gauge measures low pressure (psig) and vacuum (inches Hg.). The high pressure gauge measures high side (discharge) pressure.
