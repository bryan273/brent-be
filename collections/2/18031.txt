The Biggest LED TV in the World Will Cost You $11,000. Update: A Mitsubishi rep has reached out saying the company has an even larger 92-inch DLP TV, which debuted late May and retails for $4,999 — much lower than Sharp‘s 90-inch set. Sharp has taken the wraps off a 90-inch set, what it says is the largest LED TV on the planet. Get ready for disappointment because watching the summer Olympics on anything else will pale in comparison.
