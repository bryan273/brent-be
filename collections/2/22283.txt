In some cases, a tumor under the nail can cause a darkened area that can resemble a subungual hematoma. If you have a darkened area under a nail, and no history of trauma to the nail, you should have it evaluated by your health care provider. The spot will grow out with the nail if it is a subungual hematoma. It will stay in the same spot under the nail if it is a tumor.
