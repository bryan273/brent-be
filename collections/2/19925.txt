Most people think of holiday greenery displays when they hear about Hollies, but Hollies make great evergreen accents in the landscape as well as beautiful additions to holiday decor. Not all Hollies have leaves with spines on the tips and red berries. Some have dark blue or black berries and rounded leaves. Hollies vary in height greatly with some varieties reaching above 30 feet while some dwarf varieties may be as small as 3 feet.
