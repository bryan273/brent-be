If your dog is a puppy and is eliminating yellow poop, you need to take it to the vet. If a puppy drinks too much milk, this can turn his stool yellow. Puppies can easily be killed by an infection, so treatment must begin ASAP. If your dog is elderly and has yellow mucus in his stool, this needs to be addressed.
