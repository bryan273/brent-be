You can reasonably expect to pay between $90 and $400 for an average cleaning for your dog. The cost may vary depending on the area in which you live, the veterinarian you choose and the amount of time that it will take to clean your dogâ€™s teeth properly.ny necessary extractions will raise the cost of the dental cleaning as well. If your dog is in a severe stage of dental disease you can almost be guaranteed that a tooth, or several teeth, will need to be pulled.
