eReimbursement is a form in Ariba used to reimburse individuals for purchases of goods they have made on behalf of the UW. Reimbursements are for rare occasions when other procurement methods are not an option. Seeking reimbursement for UW purchases of goods made with personal funds should be done only as a last resort.
