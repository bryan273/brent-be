Sugars occur naturally in some foods, including fruit and milk. However, most of the sugar you consume is added sugar, which provides no essential vitamins or minerals, just calories. Added sugars may increase your risk for weight gain, tooth decay and high triglycerides, which may make you more likely to get heart disease.
