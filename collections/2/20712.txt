The LSAT is required of all applicants. The test needs be taken only once. If you have taken it within five years of the fall semester to which you apply, you do not need to repeat the test. If you take the test more than once, all scores and their average will be reported and taken into account. For applicants to the class entering in 2015, we will accept scores taken on or after October, 2009.
