AllMusic Review by Richie Unterberger. An explosive debut, and the hardest mod pop recorded by anyone. At the time of its release, it also had the most ferociously powerful guitars and drums yet captured on a rock record.ome Maximum R&B influence lingered in the two James Brown covers, but much of Townshend 's original material fused Beatlesque hooks and power chords with anthemic mod lyrics, with The Good's Gone, Much Too Much, La La La Lies, and especially The Kids Are Alright being highlights.
