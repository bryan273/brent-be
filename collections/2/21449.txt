Acacia fiber is commonly available as a fine, white, tasteless powder. It is extracted from the acacia tree, Acacia senegal, a small, spiny tree in the same family as peas and beans. The acacia is native to semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly Senegal and Sudan, where it is grown in “gum gardens,” according to the Center for New Crops and Plant Products at Purdue University.
