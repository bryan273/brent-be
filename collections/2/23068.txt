Like ASME propane tanks, LP Gas cylinders do not explode easily and nor do they explode on their own. The requirements for a cylinder to explode or experience failure is related to heat in the same manner that heat affects the failure of an ASME propane tank. The principle is the same but because the container sizes are so different, the situations are often different as well.
