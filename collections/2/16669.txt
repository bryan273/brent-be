It depends on when you hatch them out, It you hatched them Jan/Feb they will lay a few eggs for you in the fall, they are sexually mature at 7 to 8 months, so their egg laying IS based on age.Our birds start laying in Jan here in the south, the further north you are the later they will start laying.Steve. Reply.y turkeys don't lay in the fall at all, so I don't expect eggs until their first spring. Bourbon Reds are some of my favorites, just a beautiful temperament! **do not respond to attacks.
