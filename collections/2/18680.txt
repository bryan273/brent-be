Van Gogh's early paintings, such as The Potato Eaters, were very dark and serious. When he moved to Paris in 1886, he was influenced by the art of Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists who were exhibiting there, as well as by Japanese prints. Like the Impressionists, van Gogh began using broken brushstrokes of paint and lighter colors in his work.
