1 Converting existing floor space into a family room as a do-it-yourself project runs anywhere from $200-$5,000 or more depending on the complexity of the project, the quality of the materials and your skill level; hiring a contractor for the conversion can be anywhere from $7,500-$25,000, depending on what's included. Adding a 1,500-square-foot second floor with large sections done as a do-it-yourself project (plus serving as your own general contractor when needed) can run $105,000-$225,000; hiring a remodeling contractor for the same project can be $225,000-$450,000.
