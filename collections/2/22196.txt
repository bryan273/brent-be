Abstract. 1  Urinary tract infection remains an important problem for patients with spinal cord injury. Interventions used to promote bladder emptying and maintain low-pressure voiding have variable risks for urinary tract infection. 2  Urinary tract infection remains the most common infection occurring in patients with spinal cord injury [1â€¢]. Renal failure and sepsis secondary to recurrent urinary infection were previously the most common causes of death for these patients, but with advances in voiding management, urinary infection is now an infrequent cause of mortality.
