If the insurance amount is not an even multiple of $1,000, it is rounded to the next higher multiple. The maximum benefit is $500,000. A beneficiary is designated when an employee enrolls in the plan. In the event of an insured employee's death, an application for benefits is processed through the Benefits Office.
