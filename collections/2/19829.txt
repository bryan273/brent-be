Hi DeNeese. The info below are serious side effects of Zoloft. Did you tell your doc you quit taking them? It shouldn't be too long until the meds are out of your system. You may be having a reaction to taking tramadol too soon after quitting the zoloft. Tramadol was one of the meds listed you should tell your doc about before starting zoloft. I will check to see if maybe there is an interaction.
