Reapers can appear to a dying person in any form, as well possess a human or appear in their own corporal form to the living. While reapers serve Death and are not aligned with Heaven or Hell, however they were locked out of Heaven with the other angels when Metatron enacted his spell. Their origins are unclear, and it is also unknown what relationship, if any, they have to other beings such as God or Fate.
