I have the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft. Pocket Edition was just updated to 0.12.1 with Windows 10 edition, so it was supposed to be compatible for online servers. Which it is, BUT my xbox live name is a invalid name to join a server because it has a space.In Windows 10 edition, this cannot be changed. If you have a way I can fix this, please let me know.Thanks.hich it is, BUT my xbox live name is a invalid name to join a server because it has a space. In Windows 10 edition, this cannot be changed.
