A unique locking system using stainless. steel teeth grips the pipe and an KOL ring provides a leak proof. seal. The fittings can be disconnected and used again without. the need for replacement parts. The low insertion force needed to make a connection. means Speedfit is especially easy to install in hard to. reach spaces and, as there is no need for a blowtorch, there is. no risk of fire, fumes or other damage to d√©cor. The installation is greatly enhanced by the clean, all white. appearance of pipe and fittings.
