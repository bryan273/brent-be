Sweet clover poisoning is normally a herd problem, making conditions that affect individual animals,such as blackleg, pasteurellosis, bracken fern poisoning, and aplastic anemia, less likely causes. Rodenticide poisoning (see Rodenticide Poisoning) is the primary differential diagnosis in which such large hemorrhages are also likely to occur.
