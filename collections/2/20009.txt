The nucleus presses against the annulus, causing the disc to bulge or prolapse outward. The bulged disc material is still contained within the annulus. But in some cases, the nucleus pushes completely through the annulus and squeezes out of the disc. This is called a disc herniation or protrusion. Herniation and protrusion are two words for the same thing. If a piece of the disc breaks off, it's called a sequestered fragment. Surgery is almost always needed for sequestration. The loose piece can enter the spinal canal and put pressure on the spinal cord or spinal nerve roots causing serious problems.
