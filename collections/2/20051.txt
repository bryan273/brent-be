Then take a look at our Phase Master® cables. Superior phase stability vs. temperature makes this cable the ideal. choice for phase-sensitive applications—. particularly those with wide operating. temperature ranges. Phase Master's enhanced phase stability—. a result of a proprietary combination of high. performance, tape wrapped PTFE dielectric.
