v escape = (2 x 6.67 x 10 -11 N m 2 kg -3 x 1.99 x 10 30 kg / 6.378 x 10 6 m) 0.5. v escape = 6.45 x 10 6 m/s = 6450 km/s. v escape = (2 x 6.67 x 10 -11 N m 2 kg -3 x 5.97 x 10 24 kg / 0.005 m) 0.5. v escape = 3.99 x 10 8 m/s=399,000 km/s. note: 399,000 km/sec is faster than the speed of light (300,000 km/sec). Thus, we have created (in our imaginary experiment) an object from which light cannot escape. According to the laws of modern physics, in this case according to a postulate of Albert Einstein, nothing, including light, can travel faster than light.
