Hence, this search which led me to your inquiry. They apparently used to be called Rock'n Roll Stage Planks. They were made by Jack's Cookie Company. Murray Biscuit Company bought out Jack's and now markets them as just Rock'n Roll. They are available in the New Orleans area in Sav-a-Center stores (A&P stores).
