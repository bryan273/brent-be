In addition, two nuclei are created, one for each of the cells. The nuclear membranes reform, along with new nucleoli. Yet the cell isnâ€™t officially two distinct cells until the process known as cytokinesis completes. Cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is the process which actually divides the cells into two new cells. It can occur in either anaphase or in telophase, as it depends on the type of cell. Animals cells divide by pinching the cytoplasm, creating a cleavage furrow, until the cytoplasm has completely divided.
