Solid rock is weathered by wind, water, or ice. The small sediments that break off are eroded and deposited. The deposited sediment then goes through the processes of compaction and cementation to create sedimentary rock. Fossils from dead plants and animals are found in sedimentary rock. However, students may not know that.
