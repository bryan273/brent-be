1 Massage some coconut oil on your baby’s scalp, especially on the area that is affected by cradle cap. 2  Let the oil stay on for some time and then use a baby comb or baby hair brush with very soft bristles to brush off the flakes.  Once you have brushed off the flakes, you can rinse your baby’s hair with lukewarm water.
