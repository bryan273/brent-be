Healthy kidneys make the hormone known as erythropoietin, which prompts the body to make oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Kidney disease can interrupt the healthy production of this hormone and cause a decrease in red blood cells, a condition known as anemia. Anemia and kidney disease can result in a variety of symptoms, including constantly feeling cold and shortness of breath.
