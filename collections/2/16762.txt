3 4. Electron Transport Chain-the high energy electrons trapped in NADH and FADH in glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the Krebs cycle are used to produce ATP through chemiosmosis. O 2 is the final acceptor of high energy electrons.In eukaryotesIn eukaryotes. glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, pyruvate oxidation, the Krebs cycle and the Electron Transport System occur in the mitochondrionIn prokaryotes all steps occur in the cytoplasm.
