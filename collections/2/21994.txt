Don't give children under age 6 laxatives without a doctor's recommendation. If you're pregnant, ask your doctor before using laxatives. Bulk-forming laxatives and stool softeners are generally safe to use during pregnancy, but stimulant laxatives may be harmful. If you've recently given birth, consult your doctor before using laxatives.
