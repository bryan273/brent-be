One of the signs of dehydration is tiredness. So if youâ€™re chronically tired, drink water instead of a cup of coffee or other stimulant. In fact, coffee will dehydrate you yet further because of its diuretic effect. A diuretic makes you produce more urine than usual thus getting rid of even more water from the body.
