bovine male animal, from Old English bula a bull, a steer, or Old Norse boli bull, both from Proto-Germanic *bullon- (cf. Middle Dutch bulle, Dutch bul, German Bulle), perhaps from a Germanic verbal stem meaning to roar, which survives in some German dialects and perhaps in the first element of boulder (q.v.).
