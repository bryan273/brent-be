Satisfaction Rating. I called Optum to renew Rx on April 2. I called Optum a few days later to confirm shipment at which time I was told there were no refills on the Rx. Optum Rep said they would FAX the MD to get a new Rx. MD confirmed receipt of the FAX and Faxed the Rx back. Optum claimed they did not received the Rx from the MD.
