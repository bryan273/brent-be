If healthy, pest-free fruit are on the ground, they are probably ripe. Stems prepare to separate. When an apple or pear is ready to pick, the stem swells and creates a weak point that will separate from the branch when the apple is lifted. If the apple is not ready, the stem will bend and the fruit will not separate.
