Brain Damage Occurs Within Minutes From The Onset Of A Stroke, Study Reveals Date: February 19, 2008 Source: University of British Columbia Summary: Harmful changes to the brain's synaptic connections occur within the first three minutes following a stroke. The finding, using mouse models, suggests cardiac arrest and stroke in humans would trigger a similar chain of events. Stroke is caused by loss of blood flow to the brain and is a leading cause of death and disability in North America. Synapses are tiny brain switches that relay information from one neuron to another.
