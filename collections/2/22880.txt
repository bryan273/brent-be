I am particularly proud of Laverne Cox and her role on 'Orange is the New Black' on Netflix. Laverne is a trans woman, in a trans role, bringing beautiful truth to her character, Sophia. She's tough and vulnerable at the same time, dealing with her family on the outside and her new found family on inside.
