Also, I have found a way to disable the creation of the user account when installing the driver, even though it implies editing a file before installing the driver. If you use this method, when you install the driver, you won't get the UpdatusUser account, or service installed. Here are the steps you need to follow: 1  Start the installation, and press OK. 2  The installation files will be extracted to a location on your hard drive (C:\NVIDIA is the default).
