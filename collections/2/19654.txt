A sneeze here and there is a normal event in a dog's life. You and I probably feel like it's a good thing to sneeze once in a while. Repeated sneezing, however, is not normal and may indicate a serious problem.If it goes on for too long, it may even lead to bleeding, and the sneezing will then turn into a bloody spray.ou and I probably feel like it's a good thing to sneeze once in a while.
