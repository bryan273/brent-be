This increase is mainly due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil and natural gas) and excess methane production from livestock and landfills. The most important greenhouse gases are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and fluorinated gases. Water vapor is the most abundant and possibly the most important greenhouse gas.
