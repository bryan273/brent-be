The fastest and easiest way to open your DCIM file is to double-click it. This allows the intelligence of Windows to decide the correct software application to open your DCIM file. In the case that your DCIM file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit DCIM file extensions. If your PC opens the DCIM file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your Windows registry file association settings. In other words, Windows is associating DCIM file extensions with the wrong software program.
