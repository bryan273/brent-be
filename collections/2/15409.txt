Step 2: Enable Track Changes. To start tracking changes, go to the Review tab and click Track Changes in the Tracking group (you can also press CTRL + SHIFT + E.) When Track Changes is enabled, you will see a balloon for each author at the right-hand side of the screen. Step 3: Editing. Track Changes in Word uses color coordination to avoid confusion. The first author is blue and the second is red. When additional authors make edits, they will also be assigned a unique color.
