The blood pressure chart is suitable for adults of any age. Blood pressure readings have two numbers, for example 140/90mmHg. The top number is your systolic blood pressure. (The highest pressure when your heart beats and pushes the blood round your body.) The bottom one is your diastolic blood pressure.
