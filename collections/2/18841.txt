Shunting is successful in reducing pressure in the brain in most people. VP shunts are likely to require replacement after several years, especially in small children. The average lifespan of an infantâ€™s shunt is 2 years. Adults and children over the age of 2 may not need a shunt replacement for 8 or more years.
