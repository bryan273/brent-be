Grinding. If sanding doesnâ€™t remove the rust from the metal, the next step is to move to a grinder. This is best reserved for heavier layer of rust, such as what you would find on the outside of a wheelbarrow left out in the elements over the winter and rusted over in the spring melt. The best option is to attach a wire wheel brush to the grinder and use this to grind off the layer of rust from the metal. A grinding pad also works for thicker layers.
