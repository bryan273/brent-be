Lead flashing was commonly used on chimneys, around other roof penetrations such as vent pipes, and roof junctions, such as valleys. It is still used for this, but is less common because of its cost, and the availability of alternatives. Modern alternatives: pvc, butyl rubber etc. are often less durable.
