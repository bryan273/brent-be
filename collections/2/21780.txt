The Josefina Face Mold was the fourth face mold created for the American Girl Doll line. It was first used on Josefina Montoya, who was released in 1997. Josefina's face mold has a somewhat longer, less upturned nose than the classic mold and a bit wider, though it is still thinner than the nose on the Addy mold. Compared to the classic and Addy molds, the lips are much fuller on the Josefina mold with a more pronounced philtrum.
