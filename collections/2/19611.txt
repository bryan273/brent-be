'Still Alive' from at the end of Portal during the credits. 'Still Alive' by Jonathan Coulton: http://www.jonathancoulton.com. and sung by Ellen McLain (GLaDOS, TF2 Announcer, HL2 Overwatch Administrator). I don't own the song or video in any way.nd you make a neat gun. For the people who are still alive. I'm not even angry. I'm being so sincere right now. Even though you broke my heart. And killed me. And tore me to pieces. And threw every piece into a fire. As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you! Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
