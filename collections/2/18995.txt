Adenosine, dipyridamole (Persantine), and dobutamine are the most widely available pharmacologic agents for stress testing. Regadenoson, an adenosine analog, has a longer half-life than adenosine, and therefore a bolus versus continuous administration. Adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenosine are cardiac vasodilators.
