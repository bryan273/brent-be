If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (representing a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fiber does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fiber is termed the all-or-none relationship. It should be emphasized that this relationship applies only to the unit of tissue, as well as to skeletal muscle units (the unit being the individual muscle fiber) and to the heart(the unit being the entire auricles or the entire ventricles).
