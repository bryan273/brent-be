3 min microwave, stir, 3 more minutes. I add a little sf flavored davinci's to the water before cooking. YUM. BUT, I just bought some regular steel cut oats in a bulk bin and forgot to copy the recipe. I have NO idea how much oats to water or how long to cook or anything. (the box of quick cooking steel cut is 1/3 cup oats to 1 cup water). sooooooo, how do you make yours? Last edited by stews; 07-29-2006 at 10:23 AM..
