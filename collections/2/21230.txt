Germs such as bacteria and viruses can get into the ear and cause an infection. In particular, the middle ear cavity behind the eardrum can fill up with fluid. Treatment may include managing the pain and taking antibiotics, which are medications that fight infections. Ongoing fluids in the middle ear and ongoing infections over time may cause hearing problems or other difficulties.
