As ultrasound is transmitted, there are parts of the wave that are compressed (increase in pressure or density) and parts that are rarefied (decrease in pressure or density). When used in diagnostic echocardiography, the frequency is usually above 20,000 Hz (20 kHz), and it is not audible to a human ear. Fig. 1.
