All about buzzards. The buzzard is a one of the commonest and most widespread birds of prey in the UK and the rest of Europe. It can be seen flying at any time of the year and its presence may also be given away by its plaintive, cat-like “pee-uu” call.he wings are broad and round with finger-like feathers at their ends. The buzzard is very variable in colour, but is most commonly a mid-brown, with a paler “V” on its breast. The upper wings are dark brown and the lower wings are brown at their front, with paler flight feathers behind.
