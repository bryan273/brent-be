Many of these things are passed from one generation to the next in a family by genes. What Is a Gene? Each cell in the human body contains about 25,000 to 35,000 genes. Genes carry the information that determines your traits (say: trates), which are features or characteristics that are passed on to you — or inherited — from your parents. For example, if both of your parents have green eyes, you might inherit the trait for green eyes from them.
