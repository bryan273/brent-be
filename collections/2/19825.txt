Check with your pdoc regarding the half-life of sertaline. I also don't know if AD's affect the thyroid. The low to high TSH readings maybe indicative of a problem with your thyroid. I would suggest you see an endocrinologist (endocrine system specialist) for further evaluation of your thyroid. Sheepwoman
