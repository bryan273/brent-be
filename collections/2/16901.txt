The Great Salt Lake is the only remaining element of the prehistoric Lake Bonneville, which covered most of the current state of Utah during the Pleistocene epoch. The lake is thought to have formed about 32,000 years ago but geologic evidence suggests the area held as many as 28 lakes over 3 million years.
