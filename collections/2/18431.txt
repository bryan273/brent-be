Crosslinked polyethylenes are either extruded or. injection moulded. When degree of crosslinking is. deliberately maintained very low, the resulting. compound is termed as crosslinkable polymer. Crosslinking can be combined with foaming also. Crosslinking of biopolymers and foaming is very. common in food industry. Crosslinking for partially. crosslinked extruded profile is commonly employed. in furniture. Although crosslinking of thermoplastics. such as nylon, polypropylene and styrenics has. received attention in literature.
