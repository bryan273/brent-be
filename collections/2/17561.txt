The pancreas does both. The exocrine pancreas comprises 99% of pancreatic tissue. It secretes digestive juices into the duct system that carry them on into the cavity of the duodenum. The endocrine pancreas, on the other hand, secretes hormones (insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin) directly into the bloodstream.
