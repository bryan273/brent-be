A new line of baseball bats can be considered trademarked immediately, but it will lack the legal protection of a registered trademark. A registered trademark has been officially registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or its foreign equivalent. A trademark (â„¢) may be in the process of becoming registered with the USPTO, or it may never be.
