With hydrocephalus, the cerebral spinal fluid backs up in the ventricles, causing them to expand and push on the surrounding brain. This increased size in the ventricles may be referred to as ventriculomegaly. Ventriculomegaly occurs when the two lateral ventricles are greater than 1 cm in width but less than 1.5 cm.
