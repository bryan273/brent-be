1 Budget photographers run from under $1,000; moderate photographers average between $1,000 and $3,000; and upscale photographers between $3,000 and $5,000. 2  Luxury weddings photographers average between $5,000 and upwards of $10,000.ll I can say is research. I'm a wedding photographer and it is really difficult to come up with pricing. A lot of time is spent figuring out overhead, how much time will be spent meeting, editing, and any other photo process, and how much your art is worth. All in all I make maybe minimum wage - $11 an hour.
