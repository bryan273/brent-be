Cage with heat lamp and thermometer to monitor temperature. I do not recommend using pine wood chips or shavings for bedding, as the keets may eat it and clog up their intestines. Bedding such as paper towels or newspaper should be used. You will also need to keep fresh water and fresh food down for your keets.
