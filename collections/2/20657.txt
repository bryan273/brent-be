I'm hiring a new assistant. Requirements: must handle scheduling, take dictation, have flexible hours, be able learn on the job, and lack any corporeal presence. Apple (, Tech30), Google (, Tech30), Amazon (, Tech30), and Microsoft (, Tech30) are all competing to make the best digital assistants. I wanted to choose one the old fashioned way: a job interview. I asked the applicants -- Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and Alexa -- to complete the same basic tasks, judging them on accuracy, speed and style.
