The four/five-point restraint uses a lift-latch or a rotary buckle connector (Figure 5) for attachment of the pelvic harnesses. The four/five-point restraint does not have an enabling switch. Systems without an enabling switch are active (or enabled) when the system is completely electrically connected.
