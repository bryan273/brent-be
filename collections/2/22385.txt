The image is the set of all points in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that you get by multiplying this matrix to points in $\mathbb{R}^5$, you can find these by checking the matrix on the standard basis. The kernel is the set of all points in $\mathbb{R}^5$ such that, multiplying this matrix with them gives the zero vector.
