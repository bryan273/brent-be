I also wonder is Susano'o is really his most powerful technique. Unlike Sasuke, he killed the Uchiha Clan because it was for the good of Konohagakure. Sasuke kills Orochimaru and Itachi for power and revenge.(He didn't really kill Orochimaru though. Take note that Sasuke also only defeated Orochimaru while he was sick.tachi is better. [Spoilers] Besides, Itachi was driven by love to protect his brother. Sasuke was driven by hate to destroy him. Even though Sasuke won the fight, its because Itachi didn't actually want to kill him.
