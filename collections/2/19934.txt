As an extremely naive 13 year old (homeschooled, religious, sheltered), I was baffled and concerned for my sister’s “sinful” behavior by dating a MORMON. When he broke up with her saying they were “unequally yoked” due to her not being a Mormon, I was livid on her behalf. WE were the real Christians, not him!
