What Is Apostrophe? (View all literary devices) Apostrophe comes from the Greek word apostrophos, which means “turning away.” It is a literary device in which the speaker turns, right in the middle of their narrative, to address either a person or an object that is absent. It doesn’t matter whether the person or object is real or a figment of the character’s imagination.
