The active ingredient in Kybella® is synthetic Deoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. When injected into the fat beneath the chin, Kybella® breaks down fat cells, and once destroyed, these cells can no longer store or accumulate fat.
