Are Inhalants Addictive? Youâ€™ve likely heard stories of people sniffing glue or paint fumes. Certain glues, particularly the stronger ones, contain toxic chemicals that produce a high when the fumes are inhaled. What you may not know is that all sorts of common products can be abused as inhalants. According to the Foundation for a Drug-Free World, more than 1,000 everyday products can be abused, including shoe polish, gasoline, lighter fluid and spray paint.
