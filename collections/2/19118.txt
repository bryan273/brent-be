Your doctor will diagnose atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram (EKG). This heart tracing shows a distinct pattern in the electricity of the heart that your doctor can diagnose. If your AFib comes and goes you may need to wear a continuous heart monitor (Holter monitor) to diagnose the abnormal rhythm.
