Salt Glow and Massage. 60 Minutes $85. Both our salt glow and warm oil massages use therapeutic oils to enhance relaxation, purification, and renewal. Sea salt is rich in trace minerals and is mixed with warm massage oil to help exfoliate dead layers of skin, which leaves your skin moist and glowing. This combines well with a therapeutic massage.
