How does short-term memory work in relation to long-term memory? Are short-term daily memories somehow transferred to long-term storage while we sleep? The above referenced article basically says that if you stop the production of proteins (RNA) in mice then they don't store short term memory into long term memory. However things are a little more complex than that. Sleep or perhaps a brain waves status of Alpha is necessary for the consolidation process.
