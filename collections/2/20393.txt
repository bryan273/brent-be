Cabbage grows best in regions where there is a long, cool growing season with temperatures between 45째 and 75째F. Cabbage can tolerate frost and briefly temperatures as low as 20째F. Cabbage will bolt and go to seed in temperatures greater than 80째F. Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost in spring.
