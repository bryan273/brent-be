First things first: All of us have unconscious biases. According to the Implicit Bias Primer by Jerry Kang, UCLA School of Law Professor, a few of our unconscious biases come from our direct experiences (with other people, events, situations, etc.).s I'd been listening and imagining my mother's doctor in my mind's eye, not once did I think the doctor was a WOMAN. I automatically thought her doctor was a man. AND I'M A DOCTOR! THAT is unconscious bias. Unconscious biases shape our worldview and our expectations of others.
