3. Sofitel SoBed. The French luxury hotel chain has 120 hotels in 40 countries across the world, but if you can’t spend every night in a Sofitel hotel, you can, at least, rest in a signature Sofitel SoBed. Custom designed for the hotel chain, the soft SoBed’s innerspring ensures support and diminishes movement.
