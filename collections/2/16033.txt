There's some confusion over the term pit bull as it's often used to refer to multiple breeds. American bulldogs are occasionally called pit bulls, but they're distinct from the pit bull type. American staffordshire terriers, American pit bull terriers and Staffordshire bull terriers all come under the pit bull umbrella. A Brief History Although the name pit bull refers to more than one breed, they all have the same origins.
