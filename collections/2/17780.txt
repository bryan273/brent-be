I have a Bartlett pear tree. As rule of thump I pick the large one in Mid to late August.I don't allow them to drop from the tree unless they are out of 15 feet ladder reach. I live in zone 7. As for refrigeration I never do that, leaving the bears on the kitchen counter for 7 to 10 days it gets ripen and delicious.
