When is a Pear Ready to Pick? My Pear’s are nearly ready to be picked. They should be ready in late August or early September and I know that I should really pick them when they are unripe and ripen them indoors for the best results. The trick is knowing when to harvest them, even though they are still unripe. If the Pear is difficult to pull of the tree, it isn’t ready.
