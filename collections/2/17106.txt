Century Circle Paver Program. Every brick tells a story. For a donation of $100, your name, or that of someone you wish to honor or remember, will be engraved on a brick lining Century Circle. This display area overlooks the future home of the new Air Force Flight Test Museum, to be located just outside the West Gate of Edwards Air Force Base.
