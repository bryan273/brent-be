A stimulant laxative is a substance intended to stimulate a bowel movement and help relieve constipation. In some cases, however, these substances are also used to prepare a person for bowel surgery. Unlike some other types of laxatives, stimulant laxatives donâ€™t work by forming a bulkier stool or by softening them alone.
