Ultrasound is cyclic mechanical vibration with a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing, which is approximately 25 kilohertz (25,000 hertz) in healthy, young adults. A vibration source in a mechanical medium will cause wave propagation. Ultrasound is a mechanical wave, cannot exist in vacuum.
