Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli. Remember Evan Greebel? He was a partner at Kaye Scholer (he’s since resigned) and was arrested in 2015 for securities fraud. While a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman he was the attorney for Retrophin Inc. where Martin Shkreli — the former pharma king everyone loves to hate — was CEO. The crux of the government’s allegations is that the pair defrauded Retrophin in order to pay off Shkreli’s unrelated debts.
