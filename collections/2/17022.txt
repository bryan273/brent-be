Therefore, 5 mg of oxycodone is about 16 mg of hydrocodone so oxycodone is about 3 times stronger than hydrocodone. However, geminigirl is right in that everyone is different. I have read that some say hydrocodone works better for their pain than percocet and viceversa. For me, percocet works a lot better for my pain.
