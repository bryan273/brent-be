3. Prepare the piano. This is where moving a grand piano becomes much more complicated than moving an upright. The safest way to move a grand piano (and the way that professional movers do it) is to load it onto a rolling skid board, which is basically a load-bearing board on wheels. The smaller studio uprights usually weigh between 400 and 600 pounds. 2  The monstrous full vertical or large upright piano can weigh as much as half a ton. 3  A studio piano's center of gravity is also lower than a large upright's, as it is about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall as opposed to a large upright's roughly 5-foot height.
