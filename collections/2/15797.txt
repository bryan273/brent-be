In the study, 629 adults with symptoms of a C. diff infection and positive results on a stool toxin test were assigned either to take fidaxomicin, 200 milligrams twice a day, or vancomycin, 125 milligrams four times a day. The treatment continued for 10 days. Researchers compared cure rates in each group.
