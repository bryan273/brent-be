And what is the most important change, you might ask? Well, it's official -- HEB has now stated that PIGGYBACKING is a go right there in the coupon policy! We have been able to piggyback coupons for some time, but it was really dependent on finding stores who were coupon-savvy and understood that piggybacking is not the same thing as stacking. (And before anyone asks, stacking is still not allowed at HEB.)
