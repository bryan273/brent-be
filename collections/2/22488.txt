I have been involved with the Women’s World Day of Prayer for 51 years. When I moved here 12 years ago I started going to the Mid Norfolk Villages service. This year we were privileged to host the service at Beetley Methodist Church. The Church was full and we also had a very well behaved “Guide” dog!
