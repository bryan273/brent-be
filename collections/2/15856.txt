Cost basis is the original monetary amount paid for shares of a security. When you sell or exchange shares of mutual funds or other securities, you may have a capital gain or loss that must be reported to the IRS. For example, if you have a dividend reinvestment on 5/31 and an exchange redemption that results in a loss on 6/12 in the same tax year, some or all of the loss from your redemption may be disallowed as a wash sale. 2  The amount of the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the new shares.
