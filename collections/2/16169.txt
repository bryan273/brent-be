If the 100 were selected at random from the current active members of each corp, my money would be on the French. My rationale is that the French Foreign Legion is a fairly small force selected and trained almost entirely for field combat. The Marine Corps is a vast organisation with intelligence, logistics, personnel, catering, data comms, language specialists, etc. as well as infantrymen.
