Preparing for Surgery. As a general rule, you should not eat or drink anything after midnight before your surgery. Under some circumstances, you may be given permission by your anesthesiologist to drink clear liquids up to a few hours before your anesthesia. If you smoke, the sooner you quit before surgery the better.
