The total weight of the barbell varies based on the type and number of plates loaded onto the ends of the bar and the lift being performed, and easily can be as much as over 540 kilograms (1,190 lb) with squat dedicated bar (which itself can weigh up to 65 lb (29 kg) and have up to 35 mm (1.4 in) grip section diameter).
