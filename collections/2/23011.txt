I've been a big fan of Uber for nearly two years, ever since I first used the service a year and a half ago in London. When Uber came to Norway just before Christmas, I was overjoyed. But it got a lukewarm reception in the Norwegian press and among politicians, as most new things in Norway get.t still really is that, with a very clever infrastructure in the back end. â€¢ There are about 150,000 drivers worldwide, in several different categories. In Norway, this is divided into two categories; luxury cars with private driver-permit (Uber Black) and newer private cars without a permit (Uber Pop).
