If the water is too hot, then all the ice will rapidly melt. The temperature at that moment will depend on how much ice there was and how hot the water us. From then on, the temperature will slowly reach equilibrium with the temperature of the room. If the water is not too hot, then the ice won't melt all at once. The temperature of the water will keep getting colder, and the ice will keep melting, up until some intermediate equilibrium point.
