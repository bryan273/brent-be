Scientists estimate weâ€™re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day [ 1 ]. It could be a scary future indeed, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century [ 2 ].o group of animals has a higher rate of endangerment than amphibians. Scientists estimate that a third or more of all the roughly 6,300 known species of amphibians are at risk of extinction [ 6 ]. The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate [ 7 ].
