This is not the case with pears. If pears are allowed to ripen on the tree, their flesh can become gritty and hard. Pear harvesting should be done between August and September, but if you have a keen eye, you can watch for signs of when your pears are ready to be harvested. The harvesting and storage process for pears requires little more than time, and some crates to put the pears in.
