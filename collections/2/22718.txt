Because of the malleability of lead, these sheets can be shaped closely to awkward shapes, such as the junction of a sloping roof and a chimney, without the need for the sheet to be cut. Cuts in the sheet would create a potential leak site. Copper is also used for this purpose as it is also durable and malleable.
