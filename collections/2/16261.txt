Pokemon Totodile is a fictional character of humans. All Pokemon are made up by humans based on real animals or existing objects. The stroies of Pokemon are all fictional and in most cases illogical or nonsense. Games are for only fun time and do never put any spiritual/religional or deity meaning into them!
