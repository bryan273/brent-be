If you are adding a new gas appliance, such as a gas water heater, dryer, or stove, you’ll likely need to install a new gas line. You can also extend an existing gas line, such as when adding a gas appliance outside. Some local gas companies offer this service for free, but in most cases you’ll need to hire a professional or do it yourself. The average cost of installing a 50-60 foot gas line is $200-$250, although the size of the gas line depends on how many appliances are attached to it. In most cases, you will want to install a completely new gas line; however, if you are adding a smaller appliance or already have a gas line that is rarely used, it is possible to extend an existing gas line for around 75% of the cost.
