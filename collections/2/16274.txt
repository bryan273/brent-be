Children who need TPN may have different fluid requirements and need more energy (120 kcal/kg/day) and amino acids (2.5 to 3.5 g/kg/day). Basic TPN solutions are prepared using sterile techniques, usually in liter batches according to standard formulas. Normally, 2 L/day of the standard solution is needed. Solutions may be modified based on laboratory results, underlying disorders, hypermetabolism, or other factors.
