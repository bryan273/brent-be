Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the primary chemical component of chromosomes and is the material of which genes are made. It is sometimes called the molecule of heredity, because parents transmit copied portions of their own DNA to offspring during reproduction, and because they propagate their traits by doing so.
