Alaska Caribou Hunting. Hunting Caribou in Alaska. Your unguided caribou hunt in Alaska begins when you touch down in Kotzebue, after your flight from Anchorage. Kotzebue is the gateway to the Arctic and before nightfall your camp will be set up in one of the most remote areas of the world: the arctic tundra.
