take courage in a world, full of people. you can lose sight of it. And the darkness inside you. will make you feel so small. But I see your true colors, shining through. I see your true colors, and that's why I love you. So don't be afraid, to let them show. your true colors, true colors. Are beautiful, like a rainbow.
