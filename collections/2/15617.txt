Time change and nowadays there is a tremendous variety of gold bullion in the form of solid gold coins and bars from many mints and countries. You can now buy gold bullion bars as small as 1 gram or a 20th of a troy ounce. Of course buying gold in such small quantities is not very practical as the cost is so high.
