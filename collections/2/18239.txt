The speed of sound in water is 1454M/sec. The speed in air is 332M/sec. When we are out sailing our boat, we can hear a motor boat before we can see it by the sound traveling through the water and coming in through the keel. When they are testing sonar in the area we can hear the sonar through the keel also.
