Can you cross your leg/s and tie your shoe/s after a hip replacement? How long after? Just wondering if you can cross your leg/s and or tie your shoe/s after you have a hip replacement surgery. If so, about how long after? How long are you also in misery and pain? Is a hip replacement that bad of a procedure? Thanks.
