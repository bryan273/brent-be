Ernest Bairstow and Evelyn Beatrice Longman carved other parts of the Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1922, by President Warren G. Harding. Robert Todd Lincoln, the only son of President Lincoln who was alive then, was there to see the dedication. In 1922 there were 48 states in the United States, rather than the 36 that the columns stood for.
