Well, this one is a bit hard to answer. The price of bottle service varies both from club to club and from night to night. Chances are, if you want bottle service on a Tuesday night, it's not going to cost as much as it would on Saturday night. Prices for bottle service for regular vodka such as Absolut start at roughly $350 for a 750ml bottle, but can be $475 at Vegas' hottest clubs.
