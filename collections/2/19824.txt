Hinckley, Ohio WHERE BUZZARDS ROOST Excerpt from a past edition of www.ohiotraveler.com by Robert Carpenter. We have never associated buzzards with anything appealing. They eat dead stuff. Technically a buzzard is a vulture and that word summons an even uglier image.On top of that, this particular vulture is really a turkey.t could be that the return of the buzzards at the same place and time each year is observed as one of natureâ€™s curious phenomenons, or it could be that they signal that spring is just around the corner, or it might be that the generally misunderstood turkey vulture is rightly a praiseworthy bird.
