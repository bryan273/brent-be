The embryos were then transferred to recipient women. They had pregnancies when the recipient's cycle was from 4 days in front of to 3 days behind the donor's uterus at ovulation. This suggests a window of implantation of up to 7 days. Navot et al, in 1991 reported on donor embryo transfers done with 2-3 day old embryos on recipient cycle days 15-20 (artificial cycles controlled with meds).
