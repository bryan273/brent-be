Hate #1. The Eating Times: Portuguese restaurants close their kitchens from 3PM until 7 or 8PM each day. That means if you get peckish for Porco Preto or salivating for Sardines at 5 or 6PM you are out of luck. You can get small snacks and the fast food joints are open, but the traditional fair is not available.ate # 5. Service: Now, not all service is bad in Portugal, if you find a family run restaurant (tasca) or store you will be pleasantly surprised. But the chain stores and restaurants have service that will turn you off of shopping.
