Moog synthesizer (pronounced /ˈmoʊɡ/ MOHG; often anglicized to /ˈmuːɡ/ MOOG, though Robert Moog preferred the former) may refer to any number of analog synthesizers designed by Dr. Robert Moog or manufactured by Moog Music, and is commonly used as a generic term for older-generation analog music synthesizers.
