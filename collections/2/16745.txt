Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the environment, while exothermic reactions release energy to the environment. Distinguish between endothermic and exothermic reactions. 1  All chemical reactions involve the transfer of energy.  Endothermic processes require an input of energy to proceed and are signified by a positive change in enthalpy.
