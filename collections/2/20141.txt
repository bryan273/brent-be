We can use just about anything that you send us. Try not to use images that are small in size. It is best if you setup your art in a graphic program using 300 dpi and the actual length and width of a skateboard. Preferably 9 x 33 inches. We accept the following files: .jpeg, .pdf, .psd, .ai, .tiff, and .png.
