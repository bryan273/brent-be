When solutions of poly(ethenol) and sodium tetraborate are mixed, the borate ions, B(OH)4-(aq) react with the hydroxyl groups (OH) of the poly(ethenol). Weak cross-linking within the polymer occurs to produce a viscoelastic gel. The high solubility in water suggests that extensive hydrogen bonding exists.
