NEC is the equivalent to using an other code selection and NOS is the equivalent to using an unspecified code selection. Think of NEC as the code set's fault: The physician provides specific findings but the ICD-9-CM code set does not list a specific code that describes the diagnosis. On the other hand consider NOS the physician's fault: The documentation does not provide enough information to assign a more specific diagnosis code. NEC codes are frequently highlighted in gray in the ICD-9 manual and NOS codes are usually highlighted in yellow. An example of when you would use an NEC code: The physician specifies spinal nerve root compression. You look in the 724.x category - Other and unspecified disorders of back - for the appropriate code.
