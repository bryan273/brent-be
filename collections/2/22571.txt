Hello, Thank you for the question. You will simply need to write to either or both of the Representatives from your State of residence. There is no form, you just write a letter with your concerns, facts, requests, etc,., and they will investigate it with the military department you are in.Your Command will have to provide a detailed response to your allegations back through the Chain of Command to the Representative.ou can find a list of contacts and address of each state's Congressional delegation by going to: http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ for your Representative and to: http://www.senate.gov/reference/common/faq/How_to_contact_senators.htm. for your Senator. Let me know if you need any clarification.
