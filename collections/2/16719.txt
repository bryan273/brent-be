[report]. [news]. We have a pet rabbit and a cat. The cat is probably to young to come to any conclusions about her ability to kill it, but she certainly has killer instincts. Will jump on the rabbits back and bite its neck etc, but I'm unsure if its just playing rough as she is probably still technically a kitten.n the interests of science we put a cat and our fairly large male rabbit in a green house to see what occurred. I was expecting the cat to look at the rabbit and think but what actually happened was the rabbit looked at the cat and thought then proceeded to rape it. Jasandjules.
