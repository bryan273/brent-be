Most likely, your headache isn't caused by a withdrawal from carbohydrates, but rather a withdrawal from a specific type of carbohydrate -- sugar. When you eat a high-sugar diet, your body quickly becomes adjusted to a ready supply of glucose, your body's preferred source of energy. When your body doesn't have the sugar it needs, you may experience low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include hunger, headache and fatigue.
