So SASUKE is stronger than naruto.The reason is because he has sharingan and he can do the rasengan and he can do fireball jutsu. Also because he has a curse mark.Lastly, sas â€¦ uke he can summon a huge eagle or bird.By the way im not saying this just because i love sasuke. I LOVE SASUKE.owever, Naruto got a gift from Itachi, so Naruto may be a little stronger than Sasuke, but that gift is unknown yet in the series. Just because they got it at the same time doesn't make them equal. Sasuke was probably stronger than Naruto without Nine-Tails being used up until Naruto learned senjutsu.
