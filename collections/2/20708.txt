At this point, with only a little more than two months until the June LSAT, there is not enough time to start studying and ensure that you will be able to practice enough to reach your full potential on this all important exam. If you have not started preparing yet, you should plan to take the October exam. If you have already started preparing and are planning to take the June LSAT, you need to make the test your absolute top priority over the next couple of months. Try to take at least two—and preferably three—practice tests a week from now until the June exam.
