You will need two simple ingredients: borax and sugar. Adult ants won't eat the solid poison, but they will take it back to the colony for the larva to eat. 2. Mix three parts sugar and one part borax. Pour the borax and sugar into a container and stir it with a spoon or fork until everything is combined.prinkle the powder across the ant trail. If the ants are entering your house through the windows and doors, sprinkle the powder across the doorway and on the window ledge. The ants will pick up the powder and carry it back to the hive for the larva to eat. The borax in the powder will kill the larva.
