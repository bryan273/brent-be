Mix until they are combined. Step 2: Add the cake mix powder, pudding, milk, vanilla extract or emulsion oil and mix until everything is combined properly. Step 3: Pour this batter into a greased/floured 8Ã—2 round cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Step 4: This step is optional but it makes the cake SUPER MOIST! I highly recommend it. Let this cake cool down and come to room temperature.
