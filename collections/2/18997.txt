As a result, regadenoson stress protocols use a single bolus, instead of a 4-6 minute continuous infusion, which was needed with adenosine. Another difference is that adenosine infusion is weight based (140mcg/kg/minute), while with regadenoson, a 0.4mg/5mL preloaded syringe dose is standard for all weights.
