Based on the graphic novel by. Road to Perdition is like a Greek tragedy, dealing out remorseless fates for all the characters. Some tragedies, like Hamlet, are exhilarating, because we have little idea how quirks of character will bring about the final doom. But the impact of Greek tragedy seems muted to me, because it's preordained.
