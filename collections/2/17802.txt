Re: Keeping Blowing Blower Motor Resistor. I personally think if the blower motor were going bad / pulling voltage it would blow the fuse before going to the resistor. If it were my car I was warranty out the resistor and see if it happens again. The resistor controls the voltage going to the blower motor.
