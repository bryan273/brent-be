There is no automatic service you have to subscribe to in order for the stick to work. If you have Amazon Prime, you have free access to Amazon Instant Video, so the stick will just easily allow you to stream it on your TV (you can get a FREE 30-day trial of Amazon Prime here). YouTube.com is free to stream as is PBS Kids (I think) and probably other channels (that are not that exciting).
