While pregnant with my first son I looked into a baby hammock briefly, but was honestly a little afraid of something that I had never seen used by a “real” person. No one I knew used one, they used cribs and bassinettes. So I bought a cradle and a crib, and ended up co-sleeping until after my son was one because he wouldn’t sleep in either one. This time I am going to try a baby hammock. After the testimonials of good friends and the online reviews I am hoping it will prevent the horrible sleep habits my son had.
