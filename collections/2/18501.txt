Sucrose is also made up of the same two simple sugars, glucose and fructose, joined together to form a single molecule containing one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule, an exact one-to-one ratio. The proportion of fructose to glucose in both HFCS 42 and HFCS 55 is similar to that of sucrose.
