If the police believe a crime has been committed they will investigate and if they are able to prove who committed the crime, they will arrest that person and charge them accordingly. Just because a police report is filed does not necessarily mean someone will be arrested or investigated. People call the police every day wanting to make reports. The police decide whether or not a case is legitimate and whether it requires further investigation or if there is enough evidence to arrest someone.
