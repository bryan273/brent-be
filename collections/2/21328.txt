Depending on the severity of your bunion there are many surgical procedures available. With each procedure the goal is to realign the joint, relieve the pain and discomfort, and correct the deformity. Each type of specific procedure to correct a bunion comes with different healing times. Around 80% of our patients stop taking pain medication 3-4 days after surgery. In mild to moderate cases of bunions, patients are allowed to be weight bearing immediately.
