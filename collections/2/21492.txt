The cerebrum is first divided in half, each considered a lobe. From there, each lobe is then again divided creating five lobes on each hemisphere. Fissures create the subdivisions, four of which are found on the cerebrum’s surface.Each subdivided lobe is named for the cranial area, particularly the bone, which is responsible for its protection.rom there, each lobe is then again divided creating five lobes on each hemisphere.
