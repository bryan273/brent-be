1 You should not cite any particular author or authors for a Wikipedia article, in general. 2  Wikipedia is collaboratively written. 3  However, if you do need to find the list of authors of a particular article, you can check the Page history.PA Style requires that you provide a separate reference entry for each term you are citing in your paper because 1) you must provide a URL for each term that goes directly to the term, and 2) you must provide the publication date for each term separately.
