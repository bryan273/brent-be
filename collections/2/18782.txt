I calculated the EPS by taking the price level and simply dividing it by the P/E ratio to arrive at the earnings per share. I took a price level of 1252.02, the trailing 12 months P/E ratio of 74.95, and arrived at 16.70 EPS. Taking the forecasted P/E ratio, of 18.95, results in an estimate of 66.07 EPS in a year.ote, this high P/E ratio is taking place several years into an expansion, and is not a result of the business cycle being at a low point. Russell Investments, itself, knows how embarrassing this is, by reporting, P/E Ex-Neg Earnings 22.61 on its website (as of June 30th 2015).
