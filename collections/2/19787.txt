All Answers (16) 1  high frequency = high spatial resolution but limited depth of penetration. low frequency = greater depth of penetration but lower spatial resolution. 2  The spatial resolution of ultrasound is actually quite good. The limitation is that the field-of-view is usually smaller than other imaging techniques. Ultrasound is also constrained by not being able to image through bone or gasses. ... Â·. higher frequency = higher spatial resolution but less depth of penetration.
