adjusted sales price. In an appraisal, the answer obtained when the sales price of a comparable property is adjusted for factors that make it different from the property being appraised. Example: Property Ais being appraised, and property B is a similar property that sold recent-ly. Property B has some features that property A does not. The sale price of property B would probably be lower if it, too, lacked that feature, so a downward adjustment is made.
