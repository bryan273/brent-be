However, human activities generate additional 'greenhouse gases'. Globally, atmospheric concentrations of two of the main greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have increased over the last 150 years. Agriculture has played a significant role in this-up to 35% of anthropogenic CH4 comes from animals and their wastes (Monteny et al. 2006).
