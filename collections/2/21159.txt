Hard to know if a faster time was due to the shoes or simply having a better day. Even still, if they could make you run 1% faster (with all other things being equal), that’s about 12 seconds for a 20 minute 5k, just from shoes! I don’t know how you could say, with any level of certainty, that a shoe makes you faster.
