Tessa turns up when a reaper in a small town disappears, and the fatally injured people in the vicinity stop dying. She is kidnapped by Alastair. Killing two reapers under a solstice moon is one of the 66 Seals. A ritual is performed, and the implement for killing is a scythe. According to Alastair, it belongs to Death one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. An old friend lent it to me.
