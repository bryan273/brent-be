The most common questions my patients are concerned about are their tired look, and sometimes that tired look to the patients is their upper eyelids and sometimes it can be in the lower eyelids. They often seek eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) to reduce the under-eye puffiness and skin hooding of their eyes.
