Veneto’s wines are some of Italy’s best known exports – the names of Soave, Bardolino and Valpolicella have long been associated with eminently drinkable Italian wines. Yet there is a lot more to this region, and indeed a lot more behind the names of its best known wines.With 26 DOCs and 13 DOCGs, Venice’s region has a substantial production of quality wine, as well as well-priced easy-drinking reds and whites bottled as IGTs.Soave is made from Garganega and Trebbiano di Soave grapes grown in the hills between Lake Garda and the town of Soave in the western province of Verona.nternational grape varieties are important in Venice’s region, in fact Merlot and Cabernet Franc have long been workhorse varieties for the region. Blending the two is increasingly important-small oak barrels are used for ageing, so the resultant wines have an excellent structure and great complexity.
