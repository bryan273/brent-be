In the crystallographic structure, short stretches from amyloid-prone regions of amyloidogenic proteins run perpendicular to the filament axis, confirming the cross-beta model. In addition, two layers of beta-sheet interdigitate to create compact dehydrated interface termed as steric-zipper interface.
