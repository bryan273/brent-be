1 Use a little apple cider vinegar to rinse out your baby’s hair. Let it stay in the hair till dries out naturally. 2  Once the vinegar becomes dry in your baby’s hair, add coconut oil onto your baby’s hair and make sure that you cover all hair.  If possible, cover your baby’s head with the help of a shower cap.
