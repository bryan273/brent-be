There are tons of amazing Disney songs. Here's some criteria we used to narrow this list down: 1. All songs are from animated films that were released to theaters. 2. All songs are sung by a character in the film. (This is why the brilliant and otherwise top five-worthy Circle of Life is not included.) 3. No straight-to-video releases or sequels. 4. All of these films are made by Walt Disney Studios.
