A coin left on a headstone lets the deceased soldiers family know that somebody stopped by to pay their respect. Leaving a penny means you visited. A nickel means that you and the deceased soldier trained at boot camp together. If you served with the soldier, you leave a dime.he tradition of leaving coins on the headstones of military men and women can be traced to as far back as the Roman Empire.
