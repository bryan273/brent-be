Best Answer: Michael is right. The answer is D. ATP or adenosine triphosphate has 3 phosphate molecules. When the bond is broken and one of these snaps off it releases energy and forms ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and a phosphate molecule. D. atp is tri (whatever..) and adp is a di. when a bond is broken off of a ATP energy is released and you are left with adp.
