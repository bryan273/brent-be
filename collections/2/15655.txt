In addition, and more importantly, the specimen should be certified by a means of temperature measurement with a digital thermometer. Acceptable ranges of temperature measurement should be within 96 to 99 degrees to preclude samples that are adulterated and or substituted. Witnessed collections are not necessary and in fact are not as reliable as the digital measurement of temperature within 96 to 99 degrees. (If witnessed collection is done, it should also have the digital measurement done).
