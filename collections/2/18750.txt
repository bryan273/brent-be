This chain, a sister to the Westin, has a hip, upscale reputation—and, like its sister hotels, some of the best beds on the road. (They’re nicknamed “The Do Not Disturb Mattresses.”) Rooms are furnished with the W Plush Top Mattress, a 13-inch thick luxury that encases over one thousand coils for ultimate comfort.
