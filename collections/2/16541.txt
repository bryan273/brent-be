Microevolution is simply a change in gene frequency within a population. Evolution at this scale can be observed over short periods of time. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies brought about by mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection below the species level. Over time, microevolution can translate into macroevolution, which is larger scale change above the species level. Microevolution is simply a change in gene frequency within a population. Evolution at this scale can be observed over short periods of time.
