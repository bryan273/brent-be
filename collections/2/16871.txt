1 Once picked, don't place the berries, still warm from the sun, in a closed bag or container. Leave the container open so moisture doesn't form in the container. 2  Don't wash berries until just before using, to prevent berries from becoming mushy.  Chill berries soon after picking to increase shelf life.
