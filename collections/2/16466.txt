What are the issues associated with upgrading MySQL from 5.1 up to 5.5 for a server hosting multiple Wordpress sites? Will there be problems with the database after the upgrade? I have Plesk 12 installed on a Ubuntu server and I can update to the latest version of MySQL (I believe only 5.5) but I don't know if this will cause issues? Is upgrading MySQL straightforward in terms of database compatibility (upgrading 5.1 to 5.5) or is it likely that things will break?
