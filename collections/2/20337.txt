However, unlike DNA, RNA is not restricted to the nucleus. It can migrate out into other parts of the cell. Some RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA) communicate the genetic message found in the DNA out to the rest of the cell for the purpose of promoting the synthesis of proteins. How a gene sequence in DNA is ultimately translated into its corresponding protein is discussed in the Protein synthesis section.
