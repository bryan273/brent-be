In this case the eyelid position is lower than normal. Eyelids can droop for many reasons, all fundamentally caused by a weakness of the muscles of the eyelid that open your eyes (levator muscle or Muellerâ€™s muscle). Eyelids can also feel heavy if there is excess upper eyelid skin or eyebrow droopiness. These conditions can occur as you age and can be corrected with surgery. Dry eyes or eye allergies can also cause the eyelids to feel heavy. This may be treated with eye drops. Finally there is a condition called blepharospasm, in which there are uncontrollable spasms of the eyelids forcing intermittent eyelid closure. This condition may be treated with Botulinum toxin injections.
