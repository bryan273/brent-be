Today, this molecule is called DNA. Nearly all of the cells within a single organism include exactly the same DNA. DNA is a linear molecule composed of four types of smaller chemical molecules called nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The order of these bases is called the DNA sequence.
