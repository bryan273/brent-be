Congressional inquiries often make sense as companions to formal military complaint procedures. The military’s response to a Congressional inquiry depends very much on the attitude, experience, and dedication of the Congressional caseworker.Caseworkers contact the military on behalf of a servicemember and ask for an explanation of the military’s actions.A standard Congressional inquiry consists of a cover letter and a copy of the servicemember’s letter, which is forwarded to the appropriate Service’s legislative liaison office.owever, a Member’s only direct power over the military is through votes on legislation and, although a Congressional office’s active involvement can be invaluable, caseworkers cannot order the military to take certain actions.
