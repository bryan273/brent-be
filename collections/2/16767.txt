The NADH pulls the enzyme's electrons to send through the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain pulls H + ions through the chain. From the electron transport chain, the released hydrogen ions make ADP for an end result of 32 ATP. O 2 attracts itself to the left over electron to make water.
