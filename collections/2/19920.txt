In the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, the cleric is one of the four base character classes. Clerics are versatile figures, both capable in combat and skilled in the use of divine magic, which they employ without any restriction despite encumbrance of their armour. In Dragon Nest, The Cleric is one of the five classes that a player may choose at the start of the game. 2  The Cleric's role in the game is mainly to support its party, as it possesses skills that heal and buff team mates. 3  Their role further branches out to Paladins and Priests, available as secondary classes at level 15.
