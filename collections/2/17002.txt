Intracranial stenosis is a narrowing of an artery inside the brain that can lead to stroke. Stenosis is caused by a buildup of plaque inside the artery wall that reduces blood flow to the brain. The process of plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis that is severe enough to cause symptoms carries a high risk of stroke and can lead to brain damage and death.
