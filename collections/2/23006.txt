Even so, Uber rates do beat cab fares in most cities. We looked at a sample trip and calculated both costs for a number of different cities. For this analysis, we used fares from UberX, the service where drivers use their own cars.Assume the trip is 5 miles and takes 10 minutes. Also, assume there is no waiting time.here is a base rate, a charge per mile and a charge per minute. It looks like the pricing structure you know well from all the miles you have logged in cabs. But Uber's pricing is actually a little deceiving. Taxis charge riders per mile when moving, and per minute when idling.
