Another plus of an FHA-insured loan is that, unlike a conventional bank loan’s terms, an FHA loan allows you to get the cash needed for the down payment as a gift from friends, family or a charity. The FHA will even allow the seller to pay your closing costs, although if they do so, it may boost your mortgage’s interest rate, since not having enough money for even that makes you look less loan-worthy.
