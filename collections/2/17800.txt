My 1997 Dodge Ram van 3500 has this blower problem: It only works on high. This has been a sporadic problem for years. 4 years ago I replaced the resistor & the wiring harness to the resistor. 3 years ago the dealer replaced the blower motor. 2 years ago the resistor again. These previous repairs would fix the problem - for a while. I just replaced the resistor again & it didn't fix it.
