An MFP (Multi-Function Product/ Printer/ Peripheral), multi-functional, all-in-one (AIO), or Multi-Function Device (MFD), is an office machine which incorporates the functionality of multiple devices in one, so as to have a smaller footprint in a home or small business setting (the SOHO market segment), or to provide centralized document management/distribution/production in a large-office setting.
