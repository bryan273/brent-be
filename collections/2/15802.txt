For example, in the diagram to the right, the bases are parallel. To find the area of a trapezoid, take the sum of its bases, multiply the sum by the height of the trapezoid, and then divide the result by 2, The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: or. where. is. , is. , is the height.and · means multiply.or example, in the diagram to the right, the bases are parallel.
