John Dickert was elected in May, 2009 by the people to bring a vision to Racine, Wisconsin. The Mayor introduced to the City a 10 year plan – partnering with the community to build Racine into one of the “Best Cities in America” to live in within 10 years. One part of his vision as well as one of his first acts as Mayor was to create a budget with zero percent increases without sacrificing services or jobs. One major asset Mayor Dickert believes Racine has is what he calls “our greatest natural resources and gems”; our lake and our river.
