I saw an ad in USA Today (I think) for Columbia State University and requested information. They send me a large catalog with hundreds of schools and information about them. Of course, this book listed Columbia State and the best of all of them. I started to contact schools and went with Columbia State because who could argue with a 28 day degree. I completed my Columbia State degree and put it on my resume.
