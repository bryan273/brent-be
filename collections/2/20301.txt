Factors That Can Influence Salary: The level of a veterinary assistant salary depends upon a few factors. For one, if a person has experience working with animals then he or she may start out at a higher salary than a person who has very little experience. Also, people who attend veterinary assistant schools will likely garner a higher than average salary because they have prepared for the responsibilities of the job.
