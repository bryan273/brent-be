To the right of the lake lie the Wasatch mountains. They are snow-covered in the winter and green with vegetation in the summer. These mountains are the main source of the water that flows into Great Salt Lake. The water of Great Salt Lake is filled with microbial life. Pink microbes fill the northern part of the lake, as well as some of the evaporation ponds. The color of the water changes, becoming intensely pink as these microbes become more plentiful through the summer and into the fall.
