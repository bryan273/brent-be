Note: Wikipedia has a tool to generate citations for particular articles. For the cite tool, see Special:Cite, or follow the Cite this page link in the toolbox on the left of the page in the article you wish to cite.PA Style requires that you provide a separate reference entry for each term you are citing in your paper because 1) you must provide a URL for each term that goes directly to the term, and 2) you must provide the publication date for each term separately.
