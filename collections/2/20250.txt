OSHA standards require a means of egress from. an excavation when it reaches 4’ in depth. Provid-. ing a ladder is the most common method of com-. pliance with this requirement. The ladder must. extend at least 3’ above the top of the trench and. be placed on firm ground within the trench. A ladder must be provided every 25 feet of lateral. travel. For a 50’ long excavation, a single ladder in. the center of the excavation would comply with. OSHA requirements assuming there are no ob-. structions blocking travel in the trench from. either direction.
