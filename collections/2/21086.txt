Since 1972, social security numbers have been issued by the central office of the Social Security Administration. The first three (3) digits of a personâ€™s social security number are determined by the ZIP Code of the mailing address shown on the application for a social security number. Prior to 1972, social security numbers were assigned by SSA field offices.
