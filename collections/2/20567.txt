At BlizzCon 2013 last night Blizzard unveiled the first footage of Heroes of the Storm, the new name for the long-in-development title that was once known as Blizzard DotA and released as a mod for StarCraft II. Heroes of the Storm is inspired by the original Defence of the Ancients: All-Stars modification for WarCraft III.
