Many sulfides, e.g., do form non-stoichiometric compounds. Many ionic compounds are referred to as salts as they can also be formed by the neutralization reaction of an Arrhenius base like NaOH with an Arrhenius acid like HCl. NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H 2 O. The salt NaCl is then said to consist of the acid rest Cl − and the base rest Na +.
