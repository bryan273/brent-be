Plug your nostrils. Your taste buds only recognize six tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and savory (Umami). The rest is in the nose. If you can avoid smelling the food, you'll avoid a large part of the flavor. Pinch your nose as you eat or drink anything to neutralize a significant portion of the taste involved.
