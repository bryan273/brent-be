The following list shows the precedence of binary operators in Prometheus, from highest to lowest. ^ *, /, % +, -==, !=, <=, <, >=, > and, unless; or; Operators on the same precedence level are left-associative. For example, 2 * 3 % 2 is equivalent to (2 * 3) % 2. However ^ is right associative, so 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 is equivalent to 2 ^ (3 ^ 2).
