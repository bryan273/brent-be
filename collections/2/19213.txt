Stir until combined. For the solid ant bait, mix the borax or boric acid in with powdered sugar (again I used 3/4 C sugar and 1/4 C of borax or boric acid). Stir well to make sure itâ€™s completely mixed. For ants in the kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere else in your home: Go outside and find a trail of ants.or ants in the garden: If you have ants in your garden, do NOT drop the ant bait directly onto the soil ! Borax and boric acid can act as herbicides and may harm your plants! Put the mixtures on tupperware lids and set those in your garden instead.
