Not Adding Salt to the Water. Another mistake often made with pasta is not adding salt to the cooking water or only adding a tiny amount. Pasta needs a lot of salt, but don’t worry, you don’t actually ingest all of it. Pasta doesn’t absorb salt like potatoes do so most of the salt will stay in the cooking water.
