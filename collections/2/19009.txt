Nuisance may be designated as public or private. A  public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public..... [A] private nuisance is a nontrespassory invasion of another's interest in the private use and enjoyment of land. Unlike a public nuisance, a private nuisance threatens only one or few persons. In order for a private nuisance to be actionable, the invasion must be either (a) intentional and unreasonable or (b) unintentional but caused by negligent, reckless, or abnormally dangerous conduct.
