The simplest and fastest way to update activity progress is to use the duration % complete type. The remaining duration is automatically computed based on the duration % complete input. If you have an activity that has a non-uniform production rate then physical % complete is the Percent Complete Type of choice. In this Percent Complete Type both the % complete and remaining duration must be input. If you are manufacturing parts then the units % complete type may be used to describe manufactured units completed.
