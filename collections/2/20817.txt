Converting that answer to feet gives almost 1478 feet per second, the escape velocity at Asteroid Ceres. As a double check, we can compute Ceres' escape velocity in reference to the Moon. The mass of Ceres is 1/100, or 0.01 of the Moon's, and its diameter compared to the Moon's is 290 miles/1080 miles, or 0.269. Dividing mass by radius (0.01 divided by 0.269) gives us 0.037. Taking the square root of 0.037 = 0.19.
