Balderdash is something that doesn't make sense; complete and utter nonsense. Balderdash is a rather out-of-date and archaic word now, with very British overtones. The sort of word a P.G. Wodehouse character might use. Use it in a light-hearted way, therefore, and about something that's pretty trivial. Serious concerns deserve a more serious word than balderdash.
