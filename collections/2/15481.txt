Data from other scientists and Iowa planting date studies â€” suggests to plant corn after mid-April when soil temperatures are near 50 degrees Fahrenheit to maximize yield. Germination process and soil temperature. Seed absorbs about 30 percent of its weight in water; temperature does not affect that process. But temperature does affect growth of both the radicle (first root) and coleoptile (shoot). With soil temperatures below 50 F, seeds readily absorb water but do not initiate root or shoot growth.
