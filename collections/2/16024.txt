Their greatest success was the occupation of Pylos off the coast of the Peloponnesus (425 B.C.), where Spartan defenders were taken hostage and the way was made clear for Helot runaways. The subsequent failure of Sparta to reduce Athens in the first decade of the war led to a brief peace (421 B.C.). But soon the Athenians intervened in the Peloponnesus (418 B.C.) and attacked neutral states in the Aegean.
