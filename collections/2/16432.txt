Origin & History of “meat” Etymologically, meat is a ‘portion of food measured out’. The word’s ultimate source is Indo-European *mat-, *met-‘measure’, which also lies behind English measure. this produced a prehistoric Germanic *matiz, which by the time it passed into Old English as mete had broadened out in meaning from ‘portion of food’ to simply ‘food’.
