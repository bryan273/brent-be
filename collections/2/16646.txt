Ice is at a temperature of 0 C; the surroundings are at about 20 C. For ice to melt, it must gain energy from the surroundings. Energy can be transferred (move) from the surroundings to the ice by conduction through the metal or plastic. Metal is a better conductor than plastic, so energy is transferred more quickly through the metal.
