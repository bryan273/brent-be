E Pluribus Unum on the great seal of the United States. E pluribus unum is the official motto of the United States. It means out of many, one in Latin. It has been placed on the U.S. dollar bill, and other related items. It is meant to suggest that the U.S. has become a melting pot, a way of speech that means that many people come together as one.
