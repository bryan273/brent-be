You will hear songs from Gordon Lightfoot, Guess Who, Steppenwolf, and Bachman Turner Overdrive to Bryan Adams, Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Avril Lavigne. Of course we have other traditional Canadian artists like Paul Anka, Anne Murray and even Joni Mitchell...Hopefully that gives you an idea of our proudly Canadian content, eh!? Hope to see you soon! FYI: Our 2015 Oh Canada Eh? season ends Oct 17th as we enter our Winter Season Musicals.
