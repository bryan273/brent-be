Conventional Loans. When you apply for a home loan, you can apply for a government-backed loan — like a FHA or VA loan — or a conventional loan, which is not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. This means that, unlike federally insured loans, conventional loans carry no guarantees for the lender if you fail to repay the loan.
