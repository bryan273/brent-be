The miracle fruit makes acidic foods, such as lemons and grapefruits, sweet and candy-like. But after chewing the fruit and rubbing the pulp against the tongue, the berry, known by a promising name -- miracle fruit or Synsepalum dulcificum -- releases a sweetening potency that alters the taste buds. For about 15 to 30 minutes, everything sour is sweet. Lemons lose their zing and taste like candy.
