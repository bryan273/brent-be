Soil Profile. There are different types of soil, each with its own set of characteristics. Dig down deep into any soil, and youâ€™ll see that it is made of layers, or horizons (O, A, E, B, C, R). Put the horizons together, and they form a soil profile. Like a biography, each profile tells a story about the life of a soil. Most soils have three major horizons (A, B, C) and some have an organic horizon (O).
