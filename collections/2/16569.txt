PODS helped me with moving and storage. Our son moved from California to Nebraska and when I was researching, PODS stood out as being the best move. We didn’t go to U-Haul because they charge by the mileage and we weren’t sure about the container size, etc. However, PODS' advertising was a bit misleading at that time.
