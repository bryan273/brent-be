Like actual snakes, Ekans will lash out with a bite when frightened by anything it sees as a threat. If one happens to be bitten by a young Ekans, they are lucky. As an Ekans, it does not possess the ability to add venom to its bite until after it evolves into an Arbok. The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest.
