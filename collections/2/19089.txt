Your doctor may suggest a nerve block if other treatments, such as anti-inflammatory medicines, rest and physiotherapy were unsuccessful. Your doctor may also use nerve blocks as a diagnostic tool, to determine if your pain is actually coming from the sympathetic nervous system. If you experience pain relief after a nerve block, your doctor may recommend additional nerve blocks or other forms of pain therapy to target the sympathetic nerves.
