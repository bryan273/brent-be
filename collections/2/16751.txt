If heat is given off, the reaction is exothermic. Exothermic means that during the reaction, molecules have moved from a higher state of energy to a lower state. An endothermic reaction is the opposite. This is when a reaction starts colder and ends up hotter, taking in energy from start to finish. In an endothermic reaction, the system gains heat as the surroundings cool down. In an exothermic reaction, the system loses heat as the surroundings heat up.
