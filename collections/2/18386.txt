Mesalamine, olsalazine, and balsalazide do not contain sulfa. So they may be used to treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis if you cannot take sulfasalazine. Mesalamine enemas are effective in treating symptoms of mild to moderate distal (left-sided) ulcerative colitis and in maintaining remission.
