Method 3 Accessing the Router. 1. Connect a computer to the router via Ethernet. In order to access the router, you will need to be connected to the network. If you've forgotten the Wi-Fi password, the only way to connect to the network is to plug a computer into the router via Ethernet. If you cannot connect to the router via Ethernet, you may need to reset the router to its default settings and then connect via the factory-set Wi-Fi password.
