The miracle berry is now being called the berry that makes things sweet. Although technically this is not true, it does not make things sweet at all. What it actually does is make you believe that things taste sweet. It does this by the magic ingredient which is called miraculin. The miraculin is a glycoprotein that coats your tongue, blocking out certain taste bud receptors.
