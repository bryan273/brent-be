Background [edit]. On 7 September 1976, Clapton wrote Wonderful Tonight for Boyd while waiting for her to get ready to attend Paul and Linda McCartney 's annual Buddy Holly party. Of Wonderful Tonight, Boyd would say: For years it tore at me. To have inspired Eric, and George before him, to write such music was so flattering.
