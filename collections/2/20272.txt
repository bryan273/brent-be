I am very disappointed with this Black Powdered Color. I was expecting the concrete to be black, but it doesn't color it that dark. The most I could get was a slate gray color, which is far from black. All their advertising and description is deceiving, plus the shipping is horrendous if you buy more than 1 pound. They don't give a break for combined orders.
