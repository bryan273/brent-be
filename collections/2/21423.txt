The danger of sleeping with your baby. Sharing a sleep surface (such as the parents' bed or a sofa) with a baby has lead to the death of some babies. It is recommended that babies sleep in a cot in the same room as their parents for the first 6 to 12 months of life, as this has been shown to lower the risk of SIDS.
