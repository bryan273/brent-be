If you do not have specialized guinea feed at your disposal at the local farm feed store, you may feed the keets a starter feed for other types of poultry species (e.g. turkey starter). For best results when feeding keets, do not use medicated poultry starter feed. Baby guineas must always be given warm water to drink. Do not give keets cold water. Adjust the guinea feed as the guinea fowl approach maturity. When the keets reach two months of age, reduce the protein percentages to 18%. Once the keets reach maturity, you may transition them to an adult guinea fowl feeding regimen.
