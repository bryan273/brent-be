The rainforest consists of several layers. Each layer has plants and animals which are adapted to the conditions found there. In the ground layer, soil is poor and any nutrients are quickly recycled. The next layer is made up of shrubs and plants which can tolerate low light levels. The lush undercanopy consists of smaller trees which compete for the light and space. Epiphytes are found in the undercanopy.
