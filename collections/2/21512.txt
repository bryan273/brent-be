Croup is usually caused by the parainfluenza virus, although there are many other possible viral causes. These include the RS virus, influenza virus type A, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and Coxsackie virus. If a child has had croup before, it may recur when they have a cold, as this is a viral infection.
