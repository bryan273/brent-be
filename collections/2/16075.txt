Manual Three Port Valves. The three-port valve is often used when a pool and spa share one filter, heater and pump. In this situation, the water is alternately diverted to the pool or spa. Spas use the three-port valve to divert air bubbles and jet water to one side of the spa or the other, or the combination of both.
