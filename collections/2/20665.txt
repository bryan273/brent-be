1 Packages between $1,000-$3,000 may include an additional photographer and up to 8 hours of coverage, plus special albums, parents albums or photo books, though for some photographers, the fee will cover only the photography.ll I can say is research. I'm a wedding photographer and it is really difficult to come up with pricing. A lot of time is spent figuring out overhead, how much time will be spent meeting, editing, and any other photo process, and how much your art is worth. All in all I make maybe minimum wage - $11 an hour.
