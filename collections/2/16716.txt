The fact that your cat leaves the rabbits on the door is a good sign, meaning it is happy living with you, and he/she is showing their appritiation towards you. Its always a good thing to reward the cat when you find the rabbits like fussing it when you are both around your present.Though, you may not want to do this if you are trying to discourage the rabbit killing. Letting the cat kill is not irrisponsible, its nature, so ignore those stupid ignorant rabbit lovers.y cat used to do that too, except with birds. They are proud that they caught something, and they want to show you how well they did. They really can't help it, and you can't train them not to do this. Its in their blood to kill rabbits and birds and mice and stuff.
