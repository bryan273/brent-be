NASA’s goal is to reduce the cost of getting to space to hundreds of dollars per pound within 25 years and tens of dollars per pound within 40 years.he Fastrac engine is a 60,000-pound-thrust engine that will be used for the first powered flight of NASA’s X-34 technology demonstrator. Fastrac is less expensive than similar engines because of an innovative design approach that uses commercial, off-the-shelf parts and fewer of them.
