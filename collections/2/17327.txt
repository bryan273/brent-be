Behavior: Little Blue Penguins are no stranger to the ocean. They spend all day at sea from sunrise to hunting into the evening, but they also spend time on land. Little Blue Penguins live in large year-long colonies. The female penguin matures at 2 years old and the male matures at 3 years old. Each mating partner makes burrows on land to raise their chicks.
