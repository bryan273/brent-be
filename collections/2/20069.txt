Radiation treatment refers to a type of cancer treatment in which high-doses of radiation are delivered to cancerous tumors in the body. The beams of radiation pass through the skin and other materials to target a specific location where a tumor is located.arious treatment options are available for patients suffering from cancer. Depending on the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer when the patient is diagnosed, and the patientâ€™s overall health, some treatment options may make more sense, or may be more effective, than others.
