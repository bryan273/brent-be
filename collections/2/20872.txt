To extract energy from nutrient molecules, cells use the reactions of glycolysis to split glucose molecules. Other reactions and pathways then capture the energy in the chemical bonds of the breakdown product, pyruvic acid. ATP stores the released energy. 3. The reactions of glycolysis start the energy-releasing process by splitting one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvic acid.
