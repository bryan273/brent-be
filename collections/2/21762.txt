Mission: Caribou. Each and every summer the Porcupine Caribou Herd congregates in northern Alaska for one of the worldâ€™s most inspiring wildlife migrations. By late June, the herd swells to nearly 200,000 animals and we regularly see thousands and even tens of thousands of caribou climbing tundra ridges and swimming icy rivers.
