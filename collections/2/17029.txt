5 Constant wetting and drying causes wood to shrink and swell, leading to cupping and warping of the wood. 6 This damaging cycle is only the case for wood above water. The oak and pine piles on which Veniceâ€™s foundation is built are embedded in airless, muddy soil, which naturally preserves the wood.7 While piles under Venice are safe from the frequent flooding, the wood above the water level faces wetting and drying and shrinking and swelling issues. better remedy is to use a penetrating finish, where a water-repellent and fungicide can be mixed with a resin and solvent to form what is named a water-repellent preservative. 20 A more costly method is to introduce the small molecule pieces of the polymer chain into the wood and polymerize them in the wood.
