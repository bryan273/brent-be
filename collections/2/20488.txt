Everyone else just thinks he loves Man Untied. Mike Dean. Supports: Liverpool. The “penis that looks like a vagina”, as the bloke behind me at the match used to call him, was once famously withdrawn from officiating the 2006 FA Cup final when Liverpool barged their way through the semis.He later protested his innocence by suggesting he was, in fact, a Tranmere fan instead.upports: Newcastle United. The case for Mr Clattenburg appears, on the surface, to be pretty open and shut. He openly admits the he's a boyhood Newcastle United fan and, save for Alan Shearer's testimonial, he's never been given a toon game to officiate.
