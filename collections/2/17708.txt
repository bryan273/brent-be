Acidic and alkaline water, pH all water and all aqueous solutions contain both H+ and OHâ€“ ions. If the quantity of H+ exceeds that of the OH-, the water is said to be acidic. If there are more OH-ions than H+, the water is alkaline. Pure water, which contains equal numbers of both ions, is said to be neutral. Chemists express the degree of acidity or alkalinity on the pH scale which runs from about 0 to 14. Acidic solutions have pH values of less than 7, alkaline solutions more than 7.
