The clerk informed her that one door was one inch and change wider than standard size and the other door was one inch and change taller than standard size. In order to install either new door, Home Depot would need to add a small amount of trim around one side of each door frame for the cost of $75 per door. This $75 per-door modification fee is in addition to the $127 per-door installation fee (plus the $15 per-door removal fee, if you have old storm doors still in place) that Home Depot will charge to install the door (after the $35 measurement fee).
