NiMH: Powerex Imedion; beware of off-brand batteries. My favorite AA is the Imedion by Powerex. It's a good balance of capacity (2400 mAh), charge cycles (500), and low self-discharge rate (retains 85% after one year). The only downside is that they're slightly larger than regular AA's, so they might not fit in your device.
