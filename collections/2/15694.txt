Calcium Excess. After damage from a stroke, calcium, one of the body's important minerals, can leak into brain cells. This is because oxygen in blood provides energy for the body to keep just the right amount of calcium inside each cell. When there isn’t enough blood flow- there isn’t enough oxygen, so the calcium becomes unbalanced.
