A process that requires no energy input is passive. One passive process used by materials crossing a cell membrane is diffusion. Examples: oxygen diffuses through the phos â€¦ pholipid bilayer into a cell that is respiring aerobically.carbon dioxide diffuses out of cells through the phospholipid bilayer. Facilitated diffusion (diffusion through transport proteins: channel and carrier proteins) is a form of diffusion, and so it is also passive.
