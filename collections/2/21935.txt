The last surviving prop shark from the 1975 classic, Jaws, has been donated to the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles. The 25-foot prop, dubbed 'Junkyard Bruce', had been suspended over the entrance of Aalden Brothers Auto Wrecking, a 26-acre junkyard in San Fernando Valley, California, since 1990.
