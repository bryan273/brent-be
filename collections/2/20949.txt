Italics are often used to denote vehicles, such as airplanes, missiles, satellites, ships or spacecraft. 1  If a modifier or article (an, an, the) precedes the name of the vehicle, neither is italicized. Below are a few examples: 2  the Challenger (spacecraft) 3  the U.S.S Cole (ship) 4  the Titanic. 5  the Cruise missile.
