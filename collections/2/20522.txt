Exoskeleton of cicada attached to Tridax procumbens. An exoskeleton (from Greek έξω, éxō outer and σκελετός, skeletos skeleton) is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton (endoskeleton) of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as shells.
