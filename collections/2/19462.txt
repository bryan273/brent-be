Acute Toxicosis-effects that occur in the first 24 hours (suddenly) Chronic toxicosis- effects that happen due to continuous exposure ( usually over three months) Subacute and subchronic can be used to distinguish that happens between the time frame exposed to the toxin. Acute happens suddenly where chronic forms over time due to continuous exposure to the toxin.
