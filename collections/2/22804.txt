All sunscreens protect against UVB rays, but it wasn't until recent years that sunscreen started including UVA protection. And in fact, not all sunscreens do. Look for one that specifically says UVA/UVB or broad spectrum coverage on the bottle. Use a minimum of SPF 15 and reapply every hour or two at the very most.
