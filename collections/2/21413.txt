If so, I have the solution! 1  Open the file with the text you want to filter in Notepad++. 2  If you don't have it, google it and download it. 3  In the top tool bar of Notepad++, click on search/replace to open up the search and replace dialog window.4  In the replace dialog window, where it says find what enter: .*spam.*. In the replace dialog window, where it says find what enter: .*spam.*. 2  That's dot star then the text or character string you want to search for followed by another dot star. 3  Replace the word spam in my example with the text you want to search for.
