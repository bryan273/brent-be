Dyspnea is the primary COPD symptomâ€”the one that usually prompts patients to seek medical help. It's typically more pronounced in patients over 50. Individuals may complain of difficulty breathing, initially only with exertion, but later, at rest as well. 4 They might also report chest tightness, with increased sputum production. Coughing is a common manifestation of COPD.
