A massage costs more at destination and resort spas. Lake Austin Spa Resort in Austin Texas, for instance, charges $150 for a fifty-minute Swedish massage. Prices are highest at a luxury hotel spa like The Spa at Mandarin Oriental in New York City, where a 50-minutes Swedish massage lasts costs $240 plus tax and tip. Remember, however, that part of what you are paying for is access to their luxurious facilities.
