In this edition of Just Ask Bruce, he demonstrates how to stain a vertical surface, such as your front door, without letting the stain drip. Bruce recommends using Minwax® Gel Stain for vertical wood, metal, or fiberglass projects. Its unique non-drip formula makes application easy for vertical surfaces. Be sure to wipe off the dust after the final sanding. Then apply a coat of Minwax® Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner according to label directions.
