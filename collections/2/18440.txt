The only time that sawflies can be controlled is during their larval stage while they are feeding. Once the larvae turn into adult sawflies, no insecticide can affect them. It is important to scout out your plant during the spring when the larvae are young and beginning to feed. Check plants that are most susceptible to sawfly larvae attacks.
