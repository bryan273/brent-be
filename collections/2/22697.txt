Namibia is a land of oppertunity, we have smart people in our country who do know how to farm and farm well, example being Sidney Martin. These type of people can teach our commrades from Kavango and Caprivi Regions how to farm not only for themselves but in order to feed the whole Nation and make profit in the process.
