Ingress and Egress. In trench terminology, ingress and egress are words used to describe access into and exits from the trench. According to OSHA, trenches that are 4 feet or deeper require stationary egress options. Ladders, for example, must be provided and spaced such that trench workers do not have to travel more than 25 feet to the nearest ladder. This helps workers make quick getaways in a flood or cave-in.
