Today’s DIY project was completely inspired by this pin that I’ve been obsessing over on Pinterest for a while now. According to the pin, you can write or doodle on dinnerware with a Sharpie marker and bake it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and the design will stay permanently. completed all of the pieces one after the other and then baked them at the same time, using the 30 minutes at 350 degrees specified by the inspiration pin. To bake them, I simply placed them directly on the rack in the cool oven, then turned on the heat.
