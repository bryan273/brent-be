It's not actually just the sugar that's the problem. Sugar withdrawal symptoms vary and sugar withdrawal duration usually lasts between two and four weeks for most people. Tiredness, depression, flu symptoms, and irritability are common problems when you first give up eating sugar. Sugar does release opioids and dopamine, so some scientists believe it can be addictive. Most people donâ€™t realize why sugar withdrawal symptoms are so difficult to overcome.
