When added up this could mean that a fixed-rate installation of $5 per yard is actually around $18 per square yard, or more! This is the reason that contract must be drafted with the installer, and every price point identified and accepted.

This is a room measuring 16'x16' in size (256 square feet) and having no unusual angles or special cutting requirements. Can it be a DIY project?
