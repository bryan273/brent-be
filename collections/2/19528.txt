Composition. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune collectively make up the group known as the jovian planets. The general structures of the jovian planets are opposite those of the terrestrial planets. Rather than having thin atmospheres around relatively large rocky bodies, the jovian planets have relatively small, dense cores surrounded by massive layers of gas.
