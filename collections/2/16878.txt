The berries are sweet and, for many, less seedy than blackberries and worth the scratches and stains that come from picking them. In the winter the leaves often remain on the stems, but may turn dark red. The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including peach blossom moths.
