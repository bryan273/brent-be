Most reserve pilots are expected to be ready to fly at the airport 60 to 90 minutes from when they are first paged. A reserve pilot might have a few days of reserve alternating with a couple of days off, or the reserve days may be together in a long stretch followed by a long stretch of days off. Depending on a huge range of factors, a reserve pilot could fly every day of reserve, or not fly at all for weeks on end.
