Bryan Cass, LearnToMove.com. Piano movers can charge quite a bit to move your piano. In most cases, you should hire professionals to move your piano. But if you have an upright, spinet or console piano, and a relatively flat or ramped path from one place to the other, you can move it yourself and save some money.I have moved my piano into and out of 4 houses in California, 2 houses in VT, and then to our house in NY. One place even had a flight of stairs! If you have to move the piano on twisting stairs or more than 4 consecutive stairs, hire professional movers. 2  If the piano becomes unstable and begins to fall, get out of the way and let it fall. 3  Do not attempt to catch it! 4  Do not push the piano on its casters.
