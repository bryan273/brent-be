Best Answer: well rabbits are a problem in our area so it would be kinda nice to have the cat around. but you need to stop letting it out. it gets used to you letting it out when it whines that it does it because he thinks you will let him out. cats hate water.hat way the cat can think of it as hunting. Indoor cats are said to live twice as long, on the average, as outdoor cats. There are many reasons why it is better and safer for your cat to stay indoors. An added bonus is no more dead rabbit presents.
