When atrial fibrillation or flutter cause the heart to beat too rapidly, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill completely with blood. Because they do not fill completely, the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases. This decrease may cause the blood pressure to fall, and heart failure may occur.
