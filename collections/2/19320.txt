We own 3 Grocery stores in Northern VA. The BEST thing to do is buy a Grocery Store that is already UP n' RUNNING. Starting a new Grocery store is a BIG HEADACHE and you will need A LOT more money than what everyone here is estimating.f you haven't worked at a grocery store, anybody who says I want to start a grocery store! is just plain doomed to failure. Trust me, people. If you want to own a grocery store, get a job at one first. Work there for a couple years...During inventories.
