Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known by the shorter name Immune Thrombocytopenia (same abbreviation ITP), can be understood by looking at the three terms that make up its name: Immune indicates that the illness is caused by the immune system, which makes cells and antibodies that attack the person's own platelets â€” the parts of the blood that help the blood to clot. Thrombocytopenic means that the illness is related to low levels of thrombocytes, another name for platelets.
