Alternating sweet clover hay suspected of containing dicumarol with other roughage such as alfalfa or a grass-legume hay mixture can be used to avoid severe poisoning. A 7- to 10-day period on the sweet clover hay, followed by an equal time on the alternative hay, can prevent poisoning, but it will not completely prevent prolonged bleeding times. Because some animals have higher risks of serious hemorrhage (surgical candidates or pending parturition), they should not receive sweet clover hay for a minimum of 2–3 wk, and preferably ≥4 wk, before surgery or parturition.
