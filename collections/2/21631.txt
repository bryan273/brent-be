When the keets turn a week old, lower the temperature by 5 degrees. I do not recommend using pine wood chips or shavings for bedding, as the keets may eat it and clog up their intestines. Bedding such as paper towels or newspaper should be used. You will also need to keep fresh water and fresh food down for your keets. Water and food should be at the opposite end of the brooster away from the heat lamp. Keets should eat medicated turkey starter, which contains Amprolium, a coccidiostat that controls coccidiosis. Some choose to use chick feed.
