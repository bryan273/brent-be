In addition, the H-4 only flew once, making the An-225 the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times. The An-225's pressurized cargo hold is 1,300 m3 (46,000 cu ft) in volume; 6.4 m (21 ft 0 in) wide, 4.4 m (14 ft) high, and 43.35 m (142 ft 3 in) long â€” longer than the first flight of the Wright Flyer.
