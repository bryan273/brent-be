When a dog's stool is yellow, this indicates that there is an irritation in his digestive system or an infection. The yellow colored stuff is mucus, which acts as a lubricant to help move the stool through the intestinal tract and out of the dog's body. Yellow mucus is not typical. The more irritated the dog's system the greater amount of yellow mucus that will be produced. A dog's system can produce yellow mucus in the stool because of a food allergy, or it can also be an indicator that the dog has an intestinal blockage. When a dog has an infection called giardiasis, which is an intestinal infection caused b y a parasitic protozoan, this can cause his stool to turn yellow.
