The etiology may be classified as involutional, cicatricial, paralytic, mechanical or congenital. Mechanical ectropion can be seen when the lower eyelid is very swollen or there is a large mass lesion, particularly in the face of severe horizontal eyelid laxity. Cicatricial ectropion may result from skin shortage and/or scarring, e.g., due to surgery, trauma, sun damage or chronic dermatitis.
