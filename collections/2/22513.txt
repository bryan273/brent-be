Thanks to all who have already contributed photos for this site. The Great Picher Mining District of Ottawa County, Oklahoma. For about 70 years, from about 1900 until 1970, lead and zinc mining began and ended in Ottawa County, Oklahoma. During the 1920s more money was made in Ottawa County than all the others in the state combined. It was a prairie bonanza that came on fast and has now faded away.
