Workers' compensation settlements and payments. There can be a delay between when a bill is filed for the work-related illness or injury and when the workers' compensation insurance decides if they'll pay the bill. Medicare can't pay for items or services that workers' compensation will pay for promptly (generally 120 days). Medicare may make a conditional payment if the workers' compensation insurer denies payment for your medical bills pending a review of your claim (generally 120 days or longer). Note.
