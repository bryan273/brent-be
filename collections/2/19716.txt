Functional groups are groups of atoms in hydrocarbons which are responsible for their chemical properties. The types of functional groups include halocarbons, alcohols, ethers, aminoss, aldehydes, ketones, carboxyllic acids and esters. These functional groups are bound to a hydrocarbon structure denoted R.
