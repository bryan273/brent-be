Perhaps the best way to see this rotation out of small-caps and into large-caps is by charting the ratio of the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of large-caps).When the ratio goes down, investors are moving into bigger, safer names. That's what is happening right now.rinsky points out that this ratio peaked in February 2012, before the S&P 500 ultimately peaked in early April, as shown by the arrows in the chart below. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg. The chart also shows that the Russell 2000/DJIA ratio has peaked again and appears to be headed lower.
