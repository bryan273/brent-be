There are six in your group, so six divided by $350 is about $60 each, right? And you're thinking you'd spend at least $100 a night each at a Vegas club, so in that case bottle service is a damn bargain. Wrong. Most of the hottest clubs will absolutely require your group to purchase one bottle (remember, at $350 and up) for every three to four people in your group.
