It will make you run faster, and give you a better running feel. The shoe has a uniquely shaped asymmetric sole, with varying thicknesses to optimize the biomechanics. Protruding areas of the sole to give better newtonian angles for forward pushâ€¦ this leads to a faster stride and as a result, less energy lost.
