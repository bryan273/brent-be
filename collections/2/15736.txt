First, the average temperature for each state from 1901 to 2000 was calculated using the nClimDiv data set. Next, the average temperature for each state was calculated for each decade (1895-1900, 1901-1910, 1911-1920, ..., 2011-2014). Finally, each state's 20th century average was subtracted from each of its decadal averages. Negative values indicate that a decade is cooler than the long term 20th century average.
