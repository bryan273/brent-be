The first step in deciding when to buy appliances is to determine the lifespan of the ones you already have. The pros at Sears tell us that, on average, washers and dryers usually can last up to 13 to 14 years, while refrigerators and stoves can last up to 17 years. Dishwashers are usually the first to go, at about 10 years. If yours are edging toward their golden years, itâ€™s time to start thinking about (and budgeting for) replacing them. The next step is to do a little digging into the best time of the year to buy new appliances.
