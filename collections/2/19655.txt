In 2012, researchers figured out why, precisely, we sneeze, and what's supposed to happen when we do. ScienceDaily reported: Much like a temperamental computer, our noses require a reboot when overwhelmed, and this biological reboot is triggered by the pressure force of a sneeze.he sneeze is accomplished by biochemical signals that regulate the beating of cilia (microscopic hairs) on the cells that line our nasal cavities. Cold and flu season may be winding down, but sneezing -- with allergies surely on the way -- is here to stay.
