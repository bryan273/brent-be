That means that the coupon has definitively been used on both products. Could you then piggyback or stack another $1.00/1 coupon on top of this transaction - no, as a manufacturers coupon has already been used on both items purchased and there is a strict limit of one manufacturers coupon per product. You would have to buy 3 bottles of Mr. Clean to use a B1G1F coupon and an additional $1.00 coupon in one transaction.
