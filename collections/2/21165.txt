Getting Started. 1. Figure out your current speed.(Make sure you stretch before you start to run.) Before you can increase your speed, it is important to time how fast you are currently running, so you can accurately measure your progress. Use a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to run a mile. Once you have an exact time - whether it's 8 minutes or 16 minutes - you can work on improving it! This is where running on a track comes in handy, as each 400M lap of the track is equal to 1/4 of a mile, so four laps of the track is equal to one mile.
