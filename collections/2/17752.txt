Rules. 1  All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. 2  No being rude. Just because someone may not know something that you may know doesn't give you an invitation to insult them. 3  Use common sense. Nothing like Will I ever get a girlfriend etc.
