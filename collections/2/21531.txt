I'm confused about temperatures and 'doneness' with chicken breasts. J_Tay81 | Aug 16, 2013. I've been getting back into cooking, this time more seriously since I now live on my own. Tonight, I cooked some bonesless, skinless chicken breasts (unflattened/unpounded) in some olive oil in a skillet on the stove top. I bought a probe thermometer like what I used for grilling to check how done the meat was (shooting for 165 F). In the thickest part of the meat, I only got to about 140 F, but upon cutting the breasts open at the thick part, the meat is all white, cooked and sort of 'threads' apart as one would expect cooked chicken to do.
