Some cases of hip dysplasia are so mild there are no symptoms, but if your dog seems stiff or sore in the hips when getting up, if he seems hesitant to exercise, stand on his hind legs or climb stairs, or if heâ€™s limping or bunny-hopping, a visit to the vet is in order. Each case is different, depending on the dog.
