The first step in crosslinking process is generation. of free radicals, which can be through a chemical. reaction or radiation energy. Decomposition of. initiators which are normally peroxides, or high-. energy radiations abstracts hydrogen atom from the. backbone of polymer chain to produce free radicals.
