Answers from Lawrence E. Gibson, M.D. Sun rash and sun allergy are terms often used to describe a number of conditions in which an itchy red rash occurs on skin that's been exposed to sunlight. A common form of sun rash is polymorphic light eruption, also known as sun poisoning. Some people have a hereditary type of sun rash, while others develop signs and symptoms only when triggered by another factor â€” such as certain types of medications or skin exposure to certain plants, such as limes or wild parsnip.
