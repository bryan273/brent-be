Lesson 1: Exothermic and endothermic reactions. When a chemical reaction happens, energy is transferred to or from the surroundings and often there is. a temperature change. For example, when a fire burns it transfers heat energy to the surroundings. Objects near a fire become warmer and the temperature rise can be measured with a thermometer. Exothermic reactions.
