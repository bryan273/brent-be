Mark Thursday (Oct. 23) on your calendar as Solar Eclipse Day, for if the weather cooperates, you should have no difficulty observing a partial eclipse of the sun. Nearly all of North America, except for a portion of eastern Canada and a slice of eastern New England, will experience the partial solar eclipse this week.
