How to Apply for a Homestead Exemption. Homestead exemption applications must be filed with the county Property Appraiser by March 1st of the tax year for which the exemption is sought. Thus, in order to receive a 2010 homestead exemption, you must apply by March 1, 2010. If you acquired or moved into your new home after January 1, 2010, then you would not qualify for a 2010 homestead exemption, but you can go ahead and apply now for a 2011 homestead exemption.
