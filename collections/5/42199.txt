Fatty liver, or steatosis, is a term that describes the buildup of fat in the liver. While itâ€™s normal to have some fat in your liver, more than 5 to 10 percent of your liver weight is fat in the case of fatty liver. Fatty liver is a reversible condition that can be resolved with changed behaviors.
