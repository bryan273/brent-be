Disability rights organizations have asked child protection officials to prevent a Wisconsin teenager from going without her ventilator and ending her life. Jerika Bolen, 14, suffers from spinal muscular atrophy type two. The incurable disease destroys nerve cells that control voluntary muscle activity. Jerika's movement is mostly limited to her head and hands, and she says she's in constant pain.
