Still one of the most amazing events to see. It is breath taking. Love going every year! The weather seems to be holding out this year, but you never know what to expect. There is a wide variety of food to try. Definitely need to have a breakfast burrito. The cinnamon roll in the snow cone cup are super yummy.
