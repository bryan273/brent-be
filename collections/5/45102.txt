Once the Social Security Administration (“SSA”) approves someone for disability, the case is subject to an ongoing periodic review. The timing of the review varies from case to case. Sometimes, if rapid improvement is expected, the review will be done within 12 – 36 months. Otherwise the review will be every 5-7 years.
