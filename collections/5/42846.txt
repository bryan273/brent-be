Fred is one of the many rusty old cars at the Rust-Eze sponsor tent for McQueen's personal appearance; others (listed in the Car Finder game but not named in the movie's credits) include Jonathan Wrenchworths (the rusted green car in Rust-Eze advertisements) and Donna Pits (a rusted 1970s car standing beside Fred).
