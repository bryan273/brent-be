Hello Everyone, I am 8 years old, absolutly LOVE drumming since I was 2 and ROCK. Some of my favorite bands are KISS, Van Halen, RUSH, Metallica, Pantera, Avenged Sevenfold, Dream Theater, AC/DC and MANY More! I currently take private lessons from Pat DiIanni of JK Music and apply lessons while learning songs by ear and some songs I learn by sheet music. I love to add drumming and to have fun while playing. I also love playing with adult bands and doing solo shows.
