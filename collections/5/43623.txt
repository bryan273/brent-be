Alcohol is a disinfectant. It does not sterilize. Disinfection and sterilization are not the same. These words, therefore, are not interchangeable. Disinfectants such as alcohol kill pathogenic (disease causing) microorganisms including bacteria. However, there are bacteria that are resistant to disinfectants such as spores. Alcohol, as any disinfectant, reduces the number of organisms. Disinfectants are applied only on inanimate objects. Sterilization destroys/kills all forms of microorganisms. It kills bacteria (including spores), fungi, viruses.
