DNA Replication. ­DNA carries the information for making all of the cell's proteins. These pro­teins implement all of the functions of a living organism and determine the organism'­s characteristics. When the cell reproduces, it has to pass all of this information on to the daughter cells.egardless of where DNA replication occurs, the basic process is the same. The structure of DNA lends itself easily to DNA replication. Each side of the double helix runs in opposite (anti-parallel) directions.
