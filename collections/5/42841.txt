The balanced equation for fermentation is. glucose ethanol + carbon dioxide. C6H12O6(aq) 2C2H5OH(aq) + 2CO2(g) The carbon dioxide gas bubbles out of the solution. into the air leaving a mixture of ethanol and water. Fermentation must be carried out in the absence of air to. make ethanol. This is called anaerobic conditions. If air is present, ethanoic acid is made instead of ethanol. Fermentation will not happen without yeast. Yeast is a microorganism containing an enzyme. which acts as a catalyst.
