Compare and contrast the follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. *** These are all part of the ovarian cycle, where changes occur in the follicles of the ovary. FOLLICULAR: 1st part of the cycle. It's a period of follicular growth (when the egg matures). OVULATION: One or more follicles have ripened & the ovary releases the oocyte(s). LUTEAL: Following ovulation when the ruptured follicle becomes a corpus luteum (which secretes estrogen/progesterone in prep for pregnancy). If pregnancy does not occur, corpus luteum degenerates & the ovarian cycle begins again.
