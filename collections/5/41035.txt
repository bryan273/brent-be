Helpline numbers are open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week. DRC information is also available on the FEMA Mobile App. You can visit any open DRC to get your questions answered about the federal assistance process. Registration is the first step in recovery and requires information such as insurance policies, and bank information for possible direct transfer of funds.
