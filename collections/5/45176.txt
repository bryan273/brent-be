How do I tell if a meatloaf is fully cooked? The package says the internal temperature should be 175 degrees, but I don't have a meat thermometer and rarely cook meat so I'm not entirely familiar with what I should do. No one involved in the cooking of the meatloaf is a very good or experienced cook.
