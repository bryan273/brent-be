Medicare Part A is hospital insurance that covers inpatient hospital care and certain home care. Medicare Part A is usually free if you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes while working. If not, it can cost up to $413 each month in 2017. Hospital and skilled nursing facility stays come with deductibles and co-insurance.
