Teeth can get infected like anything in the human body. Infections in the teeth are known as abscesses. These can be painful and even dangerous. It is important to take care of your teeth like you would the rest of your body. If you get an infection in a tooth, the infection can spread and cause problems elsewhere. There are ways to treat tooth infections--some home remedies and others your doctor can prescribe. (Medioimages/Photodisc/Valueline/Getty Images).
