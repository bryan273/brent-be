When we see the collection of all the photons with our eyes, we average it out and call it white light. Stars hotter than the Sun also look white. It isn’t until you reach a temperature of around 11,000 Kelvin before a star starts to look blue from our perspective. Most white stars are going to be hotter and more massive than our Sun. This means they’re more luminous and use their hydrogen fuel up more quickly.
