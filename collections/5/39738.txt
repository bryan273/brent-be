The skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, and the membranes that line the bones. Each bone is an organ that includes nervous tissue, epithelial tissue (within the blood vessels), and connective tissue (blood, bone, cartilage, adipose, and fibrous connective tissue). Bones have many functions, including the following: Support: Bones provide a framework for the attachment of muscles and other tissues. Protection: Bones such as the skull and rib cage protect internal organs from injury. Movement: Bones enable body movements by acting as levers and points of attachment for muscles.
