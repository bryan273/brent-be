Matthew-Wilson, who has been restoring classic cars for over twenty years, says that people should buy classic cars because they love them, not because they want to make money from them. â€œFor many classic car enthusiasts, their car is a part of their family.ars are a poor investment. its old news. sure something that you have had in original condition, is rare, and have had for a few years will spin you a few buck, but the ones you restore to get back to original are a waste of money and time.
