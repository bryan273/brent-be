I'm going to be free.. Jerika Bolen, 14, will be named prom queen at an Appleton, Wisconsin, dance thrown tonight solely in her honor, the Appleton Post-Crescent reports. The prom is called J's Last Dance and all are invited to attend. Jerika was diagnosed with type 2 spinal muscular atrophy when she was just 8 months old.
