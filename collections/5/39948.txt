Small Intestine: Tacos de Tripas at La Salsita. Wednesday, August 4, 2010 at 1 p.m. Two tacos de tripas (small intestines) and one taco de cabeza (beef head) from La Salsita. Despite what the supermarket aisle may lead you to believe, there's more to an animal than neatly wrapped styrofoam trays of meat. From tongue to tail, offal (pronounced awful) encompasses all those taboo edibles that don't make the cut at your local grocer.
