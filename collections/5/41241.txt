The best diet for a land hermit crab is what you would eat if you had to eat only what your parents and doctor told you to eat. That is, fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, seeds, etc. Natural, healthy foods with zero processing involved. Land hermit crabs are omnivorous and therefore eat just about anything.
