Epidemiology is the study of health in populations to understand the causes and patterns of health and illness. The Epidemiology Program, a research division of VA's Office of Patient Care Services, conducts research studies and surveillance (the collection and analysis of data) on the health of Veterans. The focus is primarily on Veterans who served in combat deployments and those who use VA health care facilities.
