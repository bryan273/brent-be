The DNA of most bacteria is contained in a single circular molecule, called the bacterial chromosome.The chromosome, along with several proteins and RNA molecules, forms an irregularly shaped structure called the nucleoid. This sits in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell.In addition to the chromosome, bacteria often contain plasmids – small circular DNA molecules. Bacteria can pick up new plasmids from other bacterial cells (during conjugation) or from the environment.his sits in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell.
