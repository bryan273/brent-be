Also, some people might convert more alcohol into EtG than others and/or excrete it more quickly. Finally, there is a maximum amount of EtG that can be measured, so drinking above that limit might not raise EtG more than can be detected (ceiling effect). It was designed to detect “any drinking”, not heavy drinking.
