The cost of installing a new exhaust can vary as it can be done as a do-it-yourself task or as a service rendered by a licensed mechanic or auto shop. 1  On average, the cost to have a professional install an exhaust system can range anywhere from as little as $150 to as much as $500 for the labor only. For example, the average cost of installing an exhaust system in Cheyenne, WY, is $80.45 per hour at an independently-owned shop and $95.20 per hour at a franchise-owned facility. 2  Most professional mechanics should not take any longer than three hours to complete the job.
