What are the differences between hypotheses, theories, and laws? Is there a difference between the terms: hypothesis, theory, and law? You betcha! In science, these terms have very specific meanings. A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested. So the statement, A watched pot never boils, is a valid scientific hypothesis because we can test it (and find that in this case it is NOT supported by the evidence). A theory is a general principle or body of principles that has been developed to explain a wide variety of phenomena. A scientific theory is NOT a wild guess. It must be consistent with known experimental results and it must have predictive power.
