Is the message convincing? Is the message consistent, both across the top management team and over time? Has top management devoted enough resources to the change program? Score: If senior management has, through actions and words, clearly communicated the need for change, you must give the project 1 point. If senior executives appear to be neutral, it gets 2 or 3 points. If managers perceive senior executives to be reluctant to support the change, award the project 4 points.
