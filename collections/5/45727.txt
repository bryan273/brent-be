Pickling Cucumbers. Cucumis sativus. Cucumbers don't do well if roots are disturbed, so it is best to plant seeds directly in the garden. Plant your seeds in soil, 2 to 3 weeks after last frost, when soil and air temperature is at least 60 F. Thin so there are 4 plants per hill. Cucumbers can also be grown in rows instead of hills, spacing 24 apart in rows 24 - 36 apart. Trellised plants can be grown as close as 10 apart.
