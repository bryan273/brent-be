Every season should have a review of its own with its own rating. First season was superb, it was creepy and amazing. Season 2 was very weird and had a lot of unresolved storylines in the end (aliens anyone?). Season 3 was a lot more fun, it was also a lot less creepy and though I enjoyed it, it wasn't horror.
