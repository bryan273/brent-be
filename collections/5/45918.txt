1 The empirical formula mass of a compound refers to the sum of the atomic masses of the elements present in the empirical formula. 2  The Molecular Mass (formula mass, formula weight or molecular weight) of a compound is a multiple of the empirical formula mass.f carbon and hydrogen are present in a compound in a ratio of 1:2, the empirical formula for the compound is CH. The molecular formula for the same compound will equal to n Ã— (CH. The empirical formula mass of this compound is: 12.01 + (2 x 1.008) = 14.026.
