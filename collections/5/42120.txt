Best Answer: For the job interview I think it would be good to know that produce includes fruits, vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, & nuts. Organic is usually kept separate and begged in different color bags. Produce comes from different parts of the world (suppliers) depending on seasonality. For example, South American produce is in season in North America's winter. Many customers want the labels to show country of origin so they can shop local, or buy USA or boycott some country or state.
