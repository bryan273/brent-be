Poverty rates for gay men and lesbians living alone are more than 20 percent, compared with 4.3 percent for partnered gay men and 7.6 percent for partnered lesbians, the organization reports. The divorce rate has helped reduce the number of married households in the United States. At the same time, others have postponed marriage or never married. And census data show that the number of cohabiting couples has shot up to 7.5 million in 2011 from 450,000 in 1960.
