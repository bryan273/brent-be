For me it depends on what brand I'm using. If its the good Stash-English Breakfast Black Tea it only needs about 1 to 1.5 minutes, and I can usually get two cups out of one tea bag. (Second cup needs to steep a bit longer). But the Lipton stuff or cheap Wal-Mart Black tea I just leave the bag in until I'm done drinking it.
