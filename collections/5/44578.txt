Add the shrimp and wine, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Bake, stirring every 5 minutes or so, until the shrimp are firm and bright pink, about 20 minutes (this will depend on the size of the shrimp you use). Add the chopped herbs. Season with more salt, if necessary. Serve immediately.
