Jazz Funk is a dance style of the body and mind. It can be lyrical in the sense of emotional interpretation. At times you may gracefully sideways shuffle on a beat and then boom!!! Hit isolations with sheer intensity! Movements are soft—then hard—then soft again. Jazz Funk tells a story with your body.
