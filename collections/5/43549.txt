1 If research is not the right career for you, you will end up spending at least 3-4 years in a career that does not bring you any benefit. 2  I think doing PhD will increase my prospects of getting a better job with higher salary.3  This is not true at all. Firstly, there is no evidence that PhDs earn more (in fact, many surveys report the other way around). 2  Secondly, a PhD degree helps you in securing only research related jobs (e.g., a faculty position, a research position in a research company).
