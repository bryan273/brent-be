Step 3: Gain access to the drain. To disconnect the drain, you'll need to gain access to the underside of the tub, either from behind the wall or through the ceiling below the bathroom. You'll next need to use a pair of channel lock pliers to disconnect the pipes below the tee where the drain and overflow valve meet.ow you dispose of the old tub will depend upon the type it is. Cast iron tubs should be broken up with a sledge hammer. Because of the sheer weight, you'll want to do this in the bathroom so you can remove the tub in sections. And because the pieces can be sharp, make sure you wear ear and eye protection at a minimum.
