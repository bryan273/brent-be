I am in the process of rebuilding a Bobcat Skidsteer with a 1.6L Ford-Fiesta/Kent/Ford Ind./Pinto/OHV engine and I am need of parts that I have not been able to locate my e-mail is ronsmachine@peoplepc.com and can be contacted at 208-251-6323.) If you have a Ford engine in your skid steer it would be an industrial motor. I can't tell you the difference (but it won't be a CVH), but any Bobcat dealer should be able to tell you the motor information with a phone call. Good luck.
