Humans have three different kinds of muscle: 1  Skeletal muscle is attached to bone, mostly in the legs, arms, abdomen, chest, neck, and face. 2  Smooth, or involuntary, muscle is also made of fibers, but this type of muscle looks smooth, not striated. 3  Cardiac (pronounced: KAR-dee-ak) muscle is found in the heart.
