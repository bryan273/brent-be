The Central problems of what and how much to produce; how to produce and for whom to produce are determined by the free price mechanism. (i) What to Produce: Let us consider the first question: â€˜which commodities are to be produced and in what quantities? The commodities which do not command positive prices in the market would not be produced. Therefore only those commodities with positive prices are to be produced and in such a way that would clear the markets. The quantity in which a commodity is to be produced is set at that level where demand equals supply.
