In fact, such currents are more accurately described as longshore drift or longshore current (the defining characteristic of a rip current is that it goes out to sea). While rip currents are localised, longshore drift is general, moving in the same direction along a whole coastline. This poses little danger in itself, but can drag surfers towards hazardous obstacles (rocks, groynes, piers, etc.) without their noticing, or simply away from supervising family members and friends.
