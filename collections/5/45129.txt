The Gel Pads last up to 30 uses. We recommend changing the gel when they no longer firmly stick to your skin or when less than 25% sticks to the skin. When replacing your gels on the Heat pain Pro, remove the protective film and install gel on the original pad. Do not rinse under water or clean the gel pads.
