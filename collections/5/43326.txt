Report to Moderator. Hi! I have been cursed with rebuilding a 1980 Ford Industrial gas engine in a Melroe Bobcat 642. This engine may have been in the 632 too. The engine is supposedly a Ford Europe Valencia engine, a hybrid of the Fiesta and Pinto engines.Nobody seems to have an oil pump for this! The Bobcat dealer says it is a Ford 731M-6600AA.his engine may have been in the 632 too. The engine is supposedly a Ford Europe Valencia engine, a hybrid of the Fiesta and Pinto engines.
