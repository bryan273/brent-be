Bromine is rarer than about three-quarters of elements in the Earth 's crust. The high solubility of bromide ions has caused its accumulation in the oceans, and commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China.s a result, many organobromide compounds that were formerly in common use—such as the pesticide, methyl bromide —have been abandoned. Bromine compounds are still used for purposes such as in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals.
