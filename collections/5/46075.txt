A little coconut oil on the nostrils will help soothe that dryness. Using a humidifier helps ease those symptoms, but once your nose is irritated, you want quick relief. The standby for most people is petroleum jelly which tends to get sticky (and smell a bit). Coconut oil helps with dry skin, so it makes sense it works for a dry nose too. Everyday Roots suggests a little of soft (but not melted) coconut oil applied with a cotton swab. The oil melts with the body heat on your skin and prevents cracking.
