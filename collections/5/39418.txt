It’s also easy to accidentally go over the speed limit when you are travelling down a steep hill. Remember to change down a gear to let your engine shoulder some of the braking. If you are moving from a 50mph zone to a 30mph zone remember that you need to be slowed down to 30mph by the time you reach the 30mph sign. If you are moving from a 30mph zone to a 50mph zone, don’t speed up before you reach the 50mph sign.
