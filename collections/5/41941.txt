If the knocking sound only happens when you are turning the steering wheel, then its the CV joints on the drive shafts. If the knocking happens when you turn the steering wheel when the car is not moving then there is a problem with the coil springs that form part of the front suspension. If the noise occurs when driving over say a speed hump then there is a problem with the shock absorbers. jason c Â· 10 years ago.
