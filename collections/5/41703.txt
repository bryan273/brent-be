Some UV waves have an energy that is high enough to cause a structural change within atoms. Visible light waves are also a form of nonionizing radiation, as is the light beam emitted by a laser. A laser beam can be visible, as in the case of a laser pointer, or a laser can emit an invisible beam of UV or infrared waves.
