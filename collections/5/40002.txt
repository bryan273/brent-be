Some tutors choose to work through a private tutoring agency, such as Tutor Universe. These agencies help a tutor find work and often fetch a higher hourly rate, though the agency typically takes a portion of the earnings or charges a membership fee. Tutor Universe, for example, charges 15 to 25 percent of tutor session revenue. Other sites, such as First Tutor USA, charge tutors to post advertisements for their services on their site but donâ€™t charge a portion of the earnings from each lesson.
