An arm lift (also known as brachioplasty) is a procedure designed to reduce upper arm fat and skin that hangs down (‘batwing’ arms). If the arm has fat present, but no loose skin, liposuction alone may be performed. For those with loose skin and fat, liposuction is performed and then the loose skin trimmed and sutured.
