In 1985, Sancar described the use of E. coli as an instrument to study eukaryotic DNA repair genes. A fragment carrying the photolyase gene (PHR1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned into an E. coli expression vector and introduced into E. coli strains deficient in DNA photolyase.omplementation of the E. coli phr-1 mutation was observed. This was the first time that a complementation approach was used to study eukaryotic DNA repair genes in E. coli. After this, several other eukaryotic genes were identified and characterized by complementation assays in bacteria deficient in DNA repair.
