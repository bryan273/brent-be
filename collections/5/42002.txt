Quick Answer. Hurricane Andrew began as a tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa into the tropical North Atlantic on August 14, 1992. Two days later, after it passed just south of the Cape Verde islands, the wave became a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Andrew formed August 17 and became a hurricane three days later due to vertical wind shear.
