• Don't imagine that you could recreate the marriage you once had. A remarriage must be a new start completely. • Examine your motivation. Are you wanting to remarry your ex to make your kids happy? A marriage built on pleasing someone else won't survive. • If you remarry, work hard to avoid the attitudes or behaviors that sunk the first marriage.
