Quinoa (/ˈkiːnoʊ.ə/ , from Quechua kinwa or kinuwa) is a species of the goosefoot genus (Chenopodium quinoa), a grain crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. It is a pseudocereal, similar in some respects to buckwheat, rather than a true cereal, as it is not a member of the true grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beetroots, spinach and tumbleweeds. As a member of the Amaranthaceae family, it is related to and resembles amaranth, which is also a pseudocereal. It is high in protein, and is tolerant of dry soil. The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), declared 2013 to be the International Year of Quinoa.
