The new-look 2016 Ford Ranger PX Series II is an important vehicle for the Blue Oval brand. And that could be an understatement. So far in 2015 the Ranger is Ford ’s biggest-selling model line, with 16,157 units sold to the end of July.The ute – in two-and four-wheel-drive specifications – makes up a whopping 40 per cent of all sales for the company in Australia. It means getting the updated version spot-on is all the more vital.he best payload of the Ranger line-up is the XL 2WD Hi-Rider single-cab, which claims up to 1450kg; the worst is the Wildtrak, at 925kg. This model had a six-speed manual gearbox and at speed the shifts were easy to master. From a standstill, however, the clutch take-up point made for a few almost-stalls.
