Soon after came the idea of Bloom. Bloom (then called Bloom, A Food Lion Market) was first test marketed in Charlotte, North Carolina, through five test stores, the first of which opened on May 26, 2004. The concept is based on the idea of using a slightly unconventional layout to maximize shopper convenience.
