What is a webcam? A webcam – short for ‘web camera’ – is a digital camera that’s connected to a computer. It can send live pictures from wherever it’s sited to another location by means of the internet. Many desktop computer screens and laptops come with a built-in camera and microphone, but if yours doesn’t, you can add a separate webcam at any time.
