Cucumbers should be picked when crisp, green, and tender; large fruits should be removed from the vine so that new fruits are encouraged to grow. Slicing cucumbers are hand harvested at a range of 6-10 inches long and 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter. They usually are picked over a three-week time frame, 6 to 8 times.
