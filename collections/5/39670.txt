A tension headache is the most common type of headache. It can cause mild, moderate, or intense pain in your head, neck, and behind your eyes. Some people say that a tension headache feels like a tight band around their forehead. Most people who experience tension headaches have episodic headaches. These occur one or two times per month on average. However, tension headaches can also be chronic.
