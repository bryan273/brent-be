Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a cyto-. plasmatic enzyme present in essentially all major organ. systems. The extracellular appearance of LDH is used to. detect cell damage or cell death [1–3]. Due to its extra-. ordinarily widespread distribution in the body, serum LDH. is abnormal in a host of disorders [3–9].
