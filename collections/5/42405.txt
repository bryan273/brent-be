Solvents are liquids used to mix the other ingredients in a nail polish to yield a uniform product. Once you apply the polish, solvents evaporate away. The amount and type of solvent determines how thick a polish is and how long it takes to dry. Examples of solvents include ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and alcohol.
