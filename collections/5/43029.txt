1 Below the lumbar spine is a bone called the sacrum, which makes up the back part of the pelvis. 2  This bone is shaped like a triangle that fits between the two halves of the pelvis, connecting the spine to the lower half of the body.he sacral region (bottom of the spine). The sacrum is connected to part of the pelvis (the iliac bones) by the sacroiliac joints. Pain in the sacrum is often called sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and is more common in women than men.
