The average female dog has her first cycle about six months of age. A few dogs start earlier and few dogs later, even as late as 14-months. If you have a new female puppy, you should watch her and note when she has her first cycle. If she's 14-months old and still hasn't't been in heat, you should take her to a veterinarian. 4.
