Bluejay blueberry bushes grow almost twice as fast as other blueberry varieties so it is normal for it to be much bigger than the other bushes. Not blooming can be caused by being too close to the other bushes, not getting enough water or sun. Blueberries are picky about soil. 2  They require one that is acidic, high in organic matter, and well-drained yet moist. pH should ideally be between 4 and 5. 3  Bushes should be planted in the early spring. 4  If available, one to three-year-old plants are a good choice.
