The white of the eye. The sclera gives the eye structural strength and protection for the inner elements of the eye. This is the outer clear covering over the center of the eye. The cornea acts like both a window and a lens. Light first enters the eye through the cornea. The shape of the cornea then acts as a lens to begin to bend or “refract” light toward a focal point at the back of the eye. The cornea is the primary focusing element of the eye. It is made up of five layers of material.
