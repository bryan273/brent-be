Shake n Bake Pork Chops. Preheat oven to 425F. Dump some of the shake n bake mix in a large ziploc bag. Rinse pork chops in cold running water. Let excess water drain off. Place pork chops 1 at a time in the bag with the shake n bake. Seal and shake the bag so that the pork chop is totally coated in the breading.
