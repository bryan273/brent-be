DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – On Friday it will be 50 years since the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. But there was another murder on that dark day in Dallas — one you don’t hear as much about. Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit was killed while trying to capture Lee Harvey Oswald. In a CBS 11 exclusive, Tippit’s partner shared his memories of that day for the first time. It’s not easy for R.C. Nelson to go back to that day nearly 50 years ago.
