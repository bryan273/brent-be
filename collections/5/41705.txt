Nonionizing Radiation. We use and are exposed to nonionizing radiation sources every day. Microwave ovens use microwaves to heat food, toasters use infrared waves to heat and sometimes burn our toast, and we watch television, talk on cell phones, and listen to the radio through the use of radio waves. These are all nonionizing forms of radiation.
