The targeting efficiency is therefore as large as 0.87. Only 2% of the inhaled particles are deposited in the first 100 cm3 of the respiratory tract (extrathoracic region) and 6% in the second 100 cm3 (bronchial region). Volumetric regions 3 to 10 comprise the ventilated part of the alveolar region.
