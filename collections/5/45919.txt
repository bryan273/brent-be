For example, if the empirical formula of a compound is C 3 H 8, its molecular formula may be C 3 H 8, C 6 H 16, etc. An empirical formula is often calculated from elemental composition data. The weight percentage of each of the elements present in the compound is given by this elemental composition. H 4 S. The molar mass of the empirical formula is 84 g/mol. Since the molecular weight of the actual compound is 168 g/mol, and is double the molar mass of the empirical formula, the molecular formula must be twice the empirical formula:
