Heart Failure. Signs and Symptoms. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart fails to function properly. The terms heart failure and congestive heart failure (CHF) don't mean that the heart has actually failed or stopped but mean one or more chambers of the heart fail to keep up with the volume of blood flowing through them.
