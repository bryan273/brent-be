How to: Extend a 400mm seatpost. I have a short torso with long legs. When I need a bike, I'm in between two frame size. I need a medium frame (usually with a 80mm stem) for my torso but I would need a large frame (19 inches seat tube) for my legs.Most people always told me to get a large frame but I don't like the handling.ere is my solution that I share so that it may help other people who have the same problem and need an extension on a 400mm seatpost. This is for a seatpost with a 30.9 diameter. You need to sacrifice an old 30.9 seatpost and a 27.2. Cut a 27.2 seatpost (the lenght you need) and insert it inside the tube of the 30.9.
