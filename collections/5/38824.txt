This reaction can be used as an example of a redox reaction and can be used to introduce the concept of ionic vs covalent bonding.It is also an example of an exothermic formation reaction that produces a lot of light, so it can be used to introduce the concepts of exothemicity and enthalpies of formation.You can use the attached PowerPoint slides to illustrate lattice energy using this reaction.ome of the aluminum bromide is produced as fumes, causing the white smoke .... In addition, aluminum bromide reacts violently with water to produce HBr and aluminum hydroxide or oxide. 3. 1 Bassam Z.
