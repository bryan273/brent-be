Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public. The term optometry comes from the Greek words ὄψις (opsis; view) and μέτρον (metron; something used to measure, measure, rule). The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an optometer, (before the terms phoropter or refractor were used).
