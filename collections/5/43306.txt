My payment was due on the 20th of the month. I made my August payment on Aug. 7. Before I left I made another payment on Aug. 28 for my September payment. When I received my October statement, it showed I made no payment for September but two payments for August even though my due date was Aug. 20. I was charged a $25 late fee and an additional payment penalty for nonpayment.
