Sole Proprietorship: Legally, and for tax purposes, the individual owner is the business. A business that is jointly owned by husband and wife who file a joint tax return is generally operated as a sole proprietorship. The liabilities and profits of a sole proprietorship are personal to the owner. All of the sole proprietor's personal and business assets are at risk. The sole proprietor has total control of the business. When the owner dies, the business ceases to exist with the assets and liabilities passing to the estate.
