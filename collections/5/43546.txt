You do not need a PhD to get onto the training, but it can help a lot. The ClinPsyD is one of the hardest courses to get onto in the UK, chiefly as you get paid Â£25,528 whilst training and many of the large number of psychology graduates want to become clinical psychologists.he PhD lasts 3 years full-time, or up to 6 years part-time. Extensions are possible, but look bad for everyone, and will not be needed if everything has gone right. Do set yourself realistic although ambitious goals as (like always in life) work naturally expands to fulfill all the available time.
