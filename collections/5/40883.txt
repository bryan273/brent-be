Common Signs of Conception and When They Occur. The best way to determine if a woman is pregnant is a pregnancy test, which may be either a blood or urine test for hCG. However, there are classic signs and symptoms of pregnancy that may occur a few days or weeks after conception or fertilization. These include the following: A drop in basal body temperature on the day that implantation occurs. A woman may notice a light pink or brow stain in her underpants, which is called implantation bleeding. This is the earliest sign of conception. This may occur 6-12 days after ovulation, or typically 8-10 post-ovulation (dpo). It may be accompanied by lower abdominal pain or cramps that are similar to menstrual cramps, so they may be mistaken as the beginning of your period. These symptoms occur as the fertilized egg is trying to embed itself into the uterine wall.
