Allow Non-List Entries. In some workbooks though, you might want to allow other entries in those cells, in addition to the items in the drop down list. To allow other entries, you can turn off the Error Alerts in the data validation cells. To turn off Error Alerts: Select all the data validation cells. On the Ribbon, click the Data tab, and click Data Validation. Click the Error Alert tab. Remove the check mark from Show error alert after invalid data is entered. Click OK to close the Data Validation box.
