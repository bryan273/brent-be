A memoir, on the other hand, is more personal because the author recollects it vividly because it has impacted him or her in a certain manner. Memoirs need not be about events that revolved around the author. It may be something that happened to a third person but affected the author deeply. An autobiography is much more inward looking and typically revolves around the author.
