Drop in the live lobsters, one at a time. Leaving rubber bands on is optional. Cover and return to a boil as quickly as possible. When water returns to a boil, cook approximately 18 minutes for a 1- to 1¼-pound hard-shell lobster and 20 minutes for a 1½-pound hard-shell lobster. If the lobster has a soft shell, reduce the cooking time by 3 minutes. Lobsters will turn bright red when cooked.
