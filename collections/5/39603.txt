Well that all depends really, on what you want to do with zoology. Really that means someone who studies animals. So, you could get no special education and be an amatuer zoologist and use those skills to volunteer at the zoo or wild animal shelter. You could get a biology degree and get a job in an animal related field and be a zoologist. But, generally if you want a specialized education you are going to be looking at a biology major for a bachelors and then getting at least a masters if not also a doctorate in a more specialized field. There are lots of kinds of zoologists. You can study all kinds of animals from worms to primates.
