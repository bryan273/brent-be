Booster shots enhance, or boost, tetanus immunity. They ensure that you continue to be protected. In some cases, your doctor may give a booster dose after fewer than 10 years â€” for example, if you get a severe cut or puncture wound, and it has been more than five years since your last tetanus shot. I think intravenous drug abusers should get tetanus shots every five years.
