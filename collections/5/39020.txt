Cucumber pollination may be lacking in the garden where many varieties of vegetables are planted, as cucumbers arenâ€™t a favorite vegetable of pollinators. Without their pollination, you may get deformed cucumbers, slow growing cucumbers or even no cucumber fruit at all. If bees and other pollinating insects move on to more attractive vegetables, hand pollinating cucumbers can be your best chance at a successful crop. Excluding natural pollinators and using hand pollination of cucumbers can often produce more and larger cucumbers in the garden.
