Totem poles were made to represent families or tribes of the native americans. Each picture and colour on a pole represents something different so most poles were unique. While poles made by Native American tribes are the most famously  known, the Mayans, Aztecs, Native Canadians, Native Australians,  Maori, ingenious Koreans and ingenious Chinese are also known to  have built totem poles.
