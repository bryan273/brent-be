There was one particular woman who was always easy to identify because of her typical look of intense concentration: Marta Karolyi, U.S. National Team Coordinator. Karolyi, a Romanian-born gymnastics coach, has been the coordinator since 2001 when she took over for her husband Bela. The pair have spent their lives around gymnastics and have trained many notable gymnasts like Mary Lou Retton, Nadia Comaneci, Kerri Strug and Dominique Moceanu.
