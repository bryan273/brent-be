Built beside the historic plank road --which ran from Winston Salem to Fayetteville-- in 1859, the lovely Fair Grove Church stands today and is the site of meetings of the Why Not Memorial Association and various reunions, and well as weddings. The church was organized in 1859 and named Mt. Moriah Church.
