A thin layer of ice covers the coldest part of the can. Some small drops of water may appear higher on the can where it is not as cold. Describe what happens to water molecules as they move from being water vapor near the can to ice on the can. Water vapor molecules in the air near the can cooled when energy from the air transferred to the cold can. These water molecules slowed down, condensed to liquid water, and then froze to become ice. Your can might have some water and some ice on the outside of it. Explain how this is possible. Tiny drops of water appear on the part of the can above the ice because the molecules slow down and condense to liquid water.
