The carboxylic acid (X = OH) itself can function as an acylating agent when it is protonated by a strong acid catalyst as in the direct esterification of an alcohol. Two common acylation agents, with the general formula RCOX, are acid halides (X = halogen atom) and anhydrides (X = OCOR).Schotten-Baumann reaction is an acylation reaction that uses an acid chloride in the presence of dilute alkali to acylate the hydroxyl and amino group of organic compounds.n substitutive chemical nomenclature, their names are formed by adding '-oyl' as a suffix to the name of the parent compound; ethanoyl chloride, CH 3 COCl, is an example. The terms acyl and aroyl halides refer to aliphatic or aromatic derivatives, respectively.
