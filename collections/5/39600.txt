No offense, but DUH!! Wouldn't you need alot of knowledge for fixing a computer, unless your have some kind of miracle gift or what not. I think there is alot of education req â€¦ uired for this type of career.No offense but there is almost no level of education required to be a computer technician. In fact, I have a friend that went to school at Oxford.
