Two high-energy molecules that are produced during the light reactions are adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP-H). These two molecules temporarily store energy; they transfer energy into carbohydrates being produced during the light independent reactions (= Calvin cycle).
