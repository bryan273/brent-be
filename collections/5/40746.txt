Types of Property Deeds. Deeds are legal documents that transfer the ownership of an asset (such as property) from one person to another; however, there are different types of property deeds for slightly different purposes. These are the most common types of property deeds: Warranty Deed. Often used for residential real estate sales, a Warranty Deed acts as a guarantee to the buyer that the seller has the right to sell the property, and that the property is free of debt or other liens.
