Northern Ireland and Scotland are pretty close across the North Channel. Looking the other way, I can certainly see the coast of Northern Ireland very easily on a clear day from such places as Portpatrick on the west coast of Wigtownshire. The Isle of Man is also easily visible.osts: 6,637. You can, they say, on a clear day see Ireland from the great Orm LLandudno. This marker tells you what you can see and in what direction. http://www.waymarking.com/gallery/im...f9fd6f43&gid=3. Only this picture is not clear enough to see the wrighting on it.
