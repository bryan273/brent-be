To determine the molecular formula of a compound, we need to know both the empirical formula and the molar mass of the compound. Benzene, for example, has an empirical formula of CH. In a molecule of benzene, the number of carbon atoms (C) and hydrogen atoms (H) are the same. The molar mass of benzene is 78.11 g/mol.o determine the molecular formula of a compound, we need to know both the empirical formula and the molar mass of the compound.
