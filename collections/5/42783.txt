Memorial Day: Last year's average ticket prices for flights were around $400, driven primarily by the high demand for travel last minute (tickets sold more than 24 days in advance of departure were, on average, below $400).he folks over at Expedia share similar advice, though they do have particular tips for each of the summer's big holidays. In general, they note, the typical optimal window to get the best deal on airfare is between 21 and 28 days prior to departure.
