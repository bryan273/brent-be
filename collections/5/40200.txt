Anyway there is only one currency in the United Kingdom- the British Pound. Ireland the Republic of course is on the Euro like most of the E U. Wiki about pound Stirling notes. Coins are the same in Northern Ireland and in the rest of UK, so no problems there. Bank of England notes circulate freely in NI. Notes you get from ATMs and in change in NI are mostly local notes printed in NI.
