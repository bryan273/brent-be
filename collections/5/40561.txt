If you decide you want to purchase a muffler only, you’ll want to get an install estimate from your local exhaust shop BEFORE you buy that muffler. Sometimes, installation is very straightforward and the cost is as little as $100. Other times, fabrication is required and the cost can be as high as $300 (or more). Cat-back exhaust systems – anywhere from $300 to $1200 – The final cost will depend on steel thickness and type, as well as muffler quality.
