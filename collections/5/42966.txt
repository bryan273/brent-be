Best Answer: Your refrigerator water filter is almost certainly using a carbon filter and possibly another form of filtration. Although different manufacturers will have different guidelines for how long the filter will last, it's very common for an in-line filtration media to last 6 months. purchased a new refrigerator a little over a year ago that has an ice maker and water dispenser on the front door. There is a filter indicator on the inside that counts down when it's time to change the water filter.
