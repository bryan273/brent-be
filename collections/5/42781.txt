Advance booking is the best way to get cheap flight to Cancun. Book 40 to 25 days in advance to grab cheap flights. Airlines such as Air Berlin, Air Canada and Air Europa offers discounts on airline tickets. Save money by using the bus service from airport. Cheap taxis are available in the downtown area.reat Time 5. Had the best time ever in Cancun! I will 100% recommend Cancun and definitely September is the best time to travel. Flight reach on time, great weather, hotels are very decent and affordable, the city is super clean and pretty.
