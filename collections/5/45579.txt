The experiment entailed a cold pressor test, in which the participants immersed a hand into a bath of extremely cold water for up to two minutes, during which they reported on the sensation of pain. Both smoked marijuana and the THC decreased pain sensitivity and boosted tolerance to pain compared to the placebo.
