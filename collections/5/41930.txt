To measure the wavelength directly, we would need a group of instruments that measure the amplitude of the wave at the same time but at different locations. If we record the ground motion at a single location for a range of time, we can measure the time between peaks in the motion, which we call the wave period. Another important term is frequency, which is the inverse of the period, or one divided by the peak-to-peak time between wave crests. Waves are energy transmitting phenomena that have an amplitude and a wavelength. The upper panel shows a snapshot of the wave at a single time.
