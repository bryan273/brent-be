Make the brine solution by adding 5Â½ tablespoons of salt for every 20 fluid ounces of whey and mix it, dissolving as much of the salt as you can. The next day take the cheese out of the mold and cut into cubes, place in the brine solution and allow to brine in the fridge for 5 days. Store in the refrigerator.
