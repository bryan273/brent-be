Mountain Driving. Mountain driving is very different from driving in flat areas. In addition to changing weather, be prepared for steep hills, windy roads, wildlife, and rocks in the roadway. When you're driving in mountains, use a lower gear to control speeds while going up or down long, steep hills. Don't forget to check your vehicle prior to a mountain trip: brakes, steering, suspension, cooling systems, tires and the level of fluids.
