John Winston Ono Lennon was born in Liverpool, England on 9th October 1940. He is generally regarded by many to have founded the Beatles and is often seen by historians as the band's leader despite the four strong personalities within the group. Indeed, when people refer to the Beatles individually it is usually John's name spoken first. John's personal history is also the most dramatized out of the four Beatles, although this could have something to do with the tragic circumstances of his death in 1980.
