Melanin /ˈmɛlənɪn/ (Greek: μέλας - melas, black, dark) is a broad term for a group of natural pigments found in most organisms (arachnids are one of the few groups in which it has not been detected).Melanin is produced by the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine, followed by polymerization.he most common type of melanin is eumelanin. There are two types of eumelanin—brown eumelanin and black eumelanin. Pheomelanin is a cysteine-containing red polymer of benzothiazine units largely responsible for red hair, among other pigmentation. Neuromelanin is found in the brain, though its function remains obscure.
