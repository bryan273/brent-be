Minimum airline connection times are not set in stone. Most airlines do not sell tickets for connections that are impossible to make, but it remains the travelerâ€™s responsibility to allow enough time to make the connection. If your next flight is on the same airline, gate agents might hold the plane for you if your current flight is delayed, but this is never guaranteed.
