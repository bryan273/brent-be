I've been told that you can see Dublin from Holyhead Mountain on a good day. Not been up there to see it for myself though. On the north coast of Anglesey, you can see Isle of Man on many days throughout the year (mostly Spring and Summer).Some have said that they can see Cumbria also but it has to be a really clear day for that. In the Red Wharf Bay area and Moelfre, you can see around to Rhyl also but that is not that far away really.osts: 6,637. You can, they say, on a clear day see Ireland from the great Orm LLandudno. This marker tells you what you can see and in what direction. http://www.waymarking.com/gallery/im...f9fd6f43&gid=3. Only this picture is not clear enough to see the wrighting on it.
