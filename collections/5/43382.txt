What I’d like to say is the energy and vibration of a melanated person is vastly different than that of a non-melanated person and vice versa. I’m not talking ‘better or worse’ here, but vastly different none-the-less. heavily melanated person has a very strong vibration and energy. No matter what his education is or how much money he has or if he’s a Republican or whatever will stop that energy from hitting people upside the head.
