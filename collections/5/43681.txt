For one thing, the entire market for professional soccer in the US is small — male players have minimum salaries of $36,500, and about a quarter of the MLS league makes less than $50,000 (though the top players make millions) . For another, no one goes to games. Perhaps related, there’s very little sponsorship.f that, the US women’s national team took home $2 million for their victory. That’s less than a quarter of the $9 million the US men’s team got last year for getting knocked out in the round of 16. The total prize pool for the men’s tournament was a whopping $576 million — 40 times the women’s haul.
