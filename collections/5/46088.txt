The MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect is a true Solutions Architect Certification for the cloud; for Microsoft Azure. There are only 3 exams required for the MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect certification; a Developer, an Infrastructure and an Architecture exam. After I passed each exam, I wrote up a post about the study materials I used while studying so that others might have an easier time passing each of the exams.
