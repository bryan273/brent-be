Heterochromia iridis treatment. Most cases of heterochromia iridis do not have any associated health or eye problems, and don't cause any worries. However, if someone is concerned about the look of their eyes they can use tinted contact lenses to give both the same colour. See an optician or ophthalmologist for advice.
