Cells that specialize in synthesizing lipids, such as liver cells called hepatocytes, have structural features that result from the need to sustain a massive production line. The smooth-endoplasmic-reticulum (SER) organelle produces fats and cholesterol, but a lipid-synthesizing cell needs more than just extra SER. The process of shipping and packaging molecules in a cell involves the integrated function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and golgi body.
