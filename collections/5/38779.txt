4.6L Fuel Octane. Run the 87 octane fuel in your truck and you will keep your engine cleaner inside(valves, etc.)have easier starting on cold mornings and save some bucks at the gas pump. The engine does not need any higher octane to perform properly, it will run worse and get worse gas milage on the high octane stuff.
