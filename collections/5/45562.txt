Although an egg has essentially no carbohydrates, it is packed with protein, healthy fats and other nutrients. A large egg has around 70 calories and slightly more than 6 grams of protein -- which makes a small contribution toward the daily protein recommendation of 46 to 56 grams per day for healthy adults. It also has 28 milligrams of calcium, 99 milligrams of phosphorus and 71 milligrams of potassium.
