Each instructor is expertly trained and develops programs tailored to each student, including modifications if needed. Every single class is different. The only problem is that the 50 minutes fly by too fast. It is amazing to feel the progress that I have made in the short time that Club Pilates Brookhaven/Chamblee has been open. Love this place and its staff! Carol M
