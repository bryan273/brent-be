I've lost money in the stock market; come to think of it, I've lost money in real estate too. But I've never lost money on cars. The reason is simple: I've always bought cars I really want to own. If you buy a car that you like, and it loses its value, at least you still like it.ast year, a McLaren F1 sold at auction for $4.1 million! I now realize this is the greatest investment I've ever made. In less than 10 years, I more than quintupled my money. Best of all, I have a car I really enjoy. But there are plenty of modern cars you can buy at real-world prices that are fun to own.
