While that by itself doesn't by itself mean enhanced techniques aren't torture, and I personally think that was a charitable way of putting it, it's an acknowledgement of bias. Many of the critics of U.S. policy are willing to ignore real forms of torture elsewhere (sometimes to a degree that makes them complicit).
