Old unused mesh wires can be used to make window screens. The sheet of meshed wire can be easily cut by a metal cutting scissor and fastened to a wooden or metallic frame to make your window screen. However, you will have to paint the net in order to make it resistant. Such a screen costs about $10-15 per window.
