This song got lots of love in the UK, where it was #1 for six weeks, remarkable since the band was little-known in Britain. It was the longest-serving British #1 in five years and the best selling record of 2003 in the UK. The group performed this on the 2004 Grammy Awards, where it was nominated for Record Of The Year.
