What's the average price to fix the front axle of my car?. The question, as asked, is impossible to answer. The average price would depend on knowing what kind of car you drive, what is wrong with the axle, and where you live (mechanic's prices vary by geographical region). A quick Google search for car repair front axle returned this site: Front Axle Shaft Replacement Cost - RepairPal Estimate. I am not affiliated with the site in any way, but you might be able to get a good estimate there.
