In 1840, seeding tools improved and the steel-toothed dump rake was invented. Horse-drawn mowers were getting better and better and by 1845 hay makers were successful in compressing hay for transport. Using horse power to cut hay allowed farmers to harvest seven to 10 times more than they could by hand.
