The word 'health' brings many things to mind. Maintaining good health involves eating right, exercising, vaccinations against diseases and visiting your doctor regularly. Your health describes how well your body is functioning and your quality of life. We can also appreciate health in a broader sense. Environmental health involves understanding the impacts of environmental and human-made hazards and protecting human health and ecological systems against these hazards.
