That brings us to the so-called “Dark Age of Greece”—surely unique in the annals of history (or pseudo-history). Not only was it supposedly a time of great material poverty, but of a virtually complete depopulation of Greece and the Mediterranean islands for at least four hundred years.…[T]here lies between the prehistoric palaces of Crete, Troy, or Mycenae, and the civilization which we know as Greek, a Dark Age covering at least several centuries. It is in this Dark Age that we must really look for the beginnings of Greece. In literature and in archaeology alike we are met with the same gap.
