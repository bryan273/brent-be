All matter, including minerals, is composed of minute particles called atoms - the building blocks of minerals. each atom has a nucleus, which contains protons (particles with positive electrical charges). Surrounding the nucleus of an atom in retgions called principal shells are electrons, which have negative electrical charges. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines its atomic number and the name of the element.
