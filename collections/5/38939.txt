Rum originates from crushed sugar cane. The sugar cane juice is turned into molasses and then fermented and distilled. Rum is often enjoyed by mixing it with other beverages, such as soft drinks. Brandy is made from fermented and distilled grapes and other fruits. It is aged for several years before being bottled.
