Why is carbon important to life? Most living things on Earth are made of carbon. Living things need carbon in order to live, grow, and reproduce. Carbon is a finite resource that cycles through the Earth in many forms. This makes carbon available to living organisms and remains in balance with other chemical reactions in the atmosphere and in bodies of water like ponds and oceans.
