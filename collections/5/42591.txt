A colon means that is to say or here's what I mean.. Colons and semicolons should never be used interchangeably. Rule 1a. Use a colon to introduce an item or a series of items. Do not capitalize the first item after the colon (unless it's a proper noun). Examples: You know what to do: practice. You may be required to bring many things: sleeping bags, pans, utensils, and warm clothing. I want the following items: butter, sugar, and flour.
