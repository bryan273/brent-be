Jogging and running. Half an hour of jogging at a 5-mph pace (that's 12-minute miles) burns about 256 calories. Cranking it up to 7.5 mph (8-minute miles) raises your burn to around 403. Running is a good example of how you can really play with the duration and intensity of your workout, Procida said. If you're going to run all out, run for 30 minutes. If you're going to jog but you want the same results, calorie-wise, go for 45 minutes to an hour..
