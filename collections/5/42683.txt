What is a Millennial? Millennials are the generation born between 1982 and sometime in the early 2000’s. However, these boundaries aren’t set in stone. Some definitions have the Millennial Generation starting as early as 1978 and starting as late as 1985. Basically, if you born a little earlier than 1982 and you consider yourself to be more Millennial than Generation X, that is your opinion.
