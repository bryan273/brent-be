Plant roots spread out on the surface to take in water. They don't grow deep because the soil is always freezing and thawing which breaks up roots. One of their adaptions to the cold climate is tiny hairs on their leaves to help keep in moisture. The animals of the tundra include fish, birds, mammals and insects.
