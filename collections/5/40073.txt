Transform fault - Examples. 1  Transform faults are commonly found linking segments of mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres. 2  Transform faults move differently than a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge. Instead of the ridges moving away from each other, like other strike-slip faults, transform fault ridges will stay in the same fixed location, and the new ocean seafloor being created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge.
