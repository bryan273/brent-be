Bioluminescent plankton can be found in oceans all over the world and both zoo-plankton and single-celled animal plankton are known to be bioluminescent. Recently the beaches at the 5* Conrad Maldives Rangali Island were glowing blue during the night with bioluminescent phytoplankton. This blue glow is created by millions of phytoplanktons (dinoflagellate), in the water. These contain luciferase, a chemical that glows in the dark when agitated, so when a wave breaks on a beach.
