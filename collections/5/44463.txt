The World Series was born in 1903, but postseason play began as early as the 1884 season. Major League Baseball does not recognize those games as an official part of World Series history, but they did set the foundation for The Fall Classic.. A match-up that remained constant from its start in 1903 through 1968. In 1969, both the American and National League split into two divisions and the League Championship was created setting the stage for some thrilling postseason moments (outside of the World Series).
