Medicare is an insurance program that primarily covers seniors ages 65 and older and disabled individuals who qualify for Social Security, while Medicaid is an assistance program that covers low-to no-income families and individuals. Some may be eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare, depending on their circumstances.
