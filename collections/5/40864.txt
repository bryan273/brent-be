Overview. Wine bottle corks traditionally come from the bark of the cork oak tree. The bark of this Mediterranean oak is thick and spongy. Every 10 to 12 years, part of the bark is stripped off in commercial harvests. The cork grows over the next 10 to 12 years making this a sustainable natural product. The scientific name of the cork oak tree is Quercus suber. It is a slow growing tree with an 150- to 250-year life span.
