Sauerkraut balls were invented in Akron, Ohio, and a in many restaurants around Akron a favorite hors d’oeuvre is a sauerkraut ball. It’s a small sphere of sauerkraut and ground up meat that is breaded and deep fried, ... a wonderful kind of tangy, tart savory hors d’oeuvre.. Going back to at least the early '60’s, crispy fried sauerkraut balls have been a favorite appetizer at Akron bars and restaurants.
