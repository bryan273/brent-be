The longest freestanding (supported only at the ends) escalator in the world is inside CNN Centerâ€™s atrium in Atlanta. It rises 8 stories and is 205 feet (62 m) long. Originally built as the entrance to the amusement park The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, the escalator is now used for CNN studio tours.
