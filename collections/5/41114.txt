Men's history is quite different from women's, so I'll separate them out. IN the medieval period there were braies, some fuller in style than others. There are drawers as we might recognize from the 15th century on, a short pair surviving on the effigy of Charles II. From the 17th century to the second quarter of the 19th century, men's underwear was truly their shirt.
