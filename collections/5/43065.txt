We know that all but one of the stroke patients who were cannabis users also used tobacco. We do not know how much — if at all — people in the comparison group used tobacco, Barber says. However, he says he believes the stroke risk is from marijuana use and not tobacco. For starters, this is a young age group to be having strokes, and many didn't have any of the traditional risk factors. And some patients had a stroke while actually smoking cannabis, he says.
