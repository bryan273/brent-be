Conrad Maldives Rangali Island also offers night dives in which divers can swim through this glowing blue beam of light. Another island that has seen this phenomena is Vaadhoo Island. Here the Plankton glowed bright blue after local plankton reacted with oxygen in the ocean to produce a light described as brighter than the Milky Way.
