Reproduction in dogs - season, heat, oestrus, pregnancy tests. Puberty or sexual maturity in the female dog usually occurs around six months of age. The smaller breeds tend to go into oestrus or heat earlier and some females can have their first heat cycle as early as four months of age. On the other hand, the large and giant breeds can be up to two years old before they come into heat for the first time.
