Milk Allergy. Milk allergy is the most common allergy among children. One to two percent of young U.S. children have a milk allergy. Children with a milk allergy must avoid milk in all forms. This includes all milk and dairy products, including “lactose free” versions of milk products. Children with milk allergy also must avoid anything containing traces of milk ingredients in it. It is important to know the symptoms of a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.
