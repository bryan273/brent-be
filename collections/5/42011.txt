I speak speak to my 5 month baby in parentese && he seems to love it! I love the part when he starts goofing back with a smile. Very fun. Way back when my second child was little. We were in a public space and I was talking to her (in parentese, though I did not know it) and a nice lady mentioned how smart my child would be because I was not using baby talk.
