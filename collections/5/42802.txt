The warranty for the Ranger is three years or 100,000km. The Ford Ranger deserves all the success it has seen over the past few years in Australia, and the Wildtrak is a worthy range-topper.t the business end, the Ranger dual-cab pick-up modelâ€™s tray measures 1549mm long and 1560mm wide, with 1139mm between the wheel arches meaning the box is big enough for a Euro pallet but not as copious as the class-leading Amarok (1555mm long by 1620mm wide, with 1222mm between the arches).
