Thanks Foxy -- I'll have to try the Martingale style snugging collar with a harness and get an extra large clip to hook them both up on the cable (or get a cable splitter with 2 clips). She'd at least have to slip the collar and then chew through the harness... which would take a minimum of 30 minutes. I do want to get her a trolley line for a run between two poles (or the house and a pole) rather than a ground-level tie-out...
