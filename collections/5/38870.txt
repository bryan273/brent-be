The kidneys are the main organs of the urinary system. They function chiefly to filter blood in order to remove wastes and excess water. The waste and water are excreted as urine. The kidneys also reabsorb and return to the blood needed substances, including amino acids, sugar, sodium, potassium, and other nutrients.
