Signing a Restrictive Covenant. By definition, a covenant is a promise included in a contract or agreement, and the definition of a restrictive covenant agreement legally implies a party's consent to be restricted by that contract. The term covenant means come together in Latin and it conveys a willingness to do just that, but restrictive covenants have come under fire in some states because of their potential for restraint of trade.
