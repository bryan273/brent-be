LAW WOULD BAN INJECTION WELLS IN MONROE COUNTY. The citizens of Summerfield Township and surrounding areas turned out over 300 strong in June to an EPA public hearing on a proposed waste injection well in Summerfield Township. The greatest concern is the karst topography of Monroe County. Since 1896, karst features in Monroe County have been documented by the Monroe County Planning Department, U.S. Geological Survey, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the Department of Natural Resources.
