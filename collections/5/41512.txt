Question: How much topsoil can I put in my pick-up truck? Answer: Most 1/2 ton pickups, which include F150's and 1500's, can safely haul about 1 cubic yard. Because 1 cy weighs about a ton, that is their upper limit. 3/4 and 1 ton pick-up trucks tend to haul as much as they can hold, which can be up to 2 cubic yards.
