Exclusively breastfed babies do not need additional water – breastmilk is 88% water and supplies all the fluids that your baby needs. Even in the first few days after birth, before mom’s milk has “come in”, colostrum is all that is needed to keep baby well hydrated (assuming baby is nursing effectively). Exclusively breastfed babies do not require additional water even when it is very hot outside, as long as baby is allowed to nurse as needed.
