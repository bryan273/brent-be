Vomiting- It is not uncommon for a Yorkie to have diarrhea and vomiting. These two things can go hand in hand. When a dog is suffering from both of these issues, it can dramatically increase the chances of developing dehydration. If the vomit is yellow and foamy, this usually means that it is stomach bile.
