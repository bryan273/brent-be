The linebacker squares up in a good football position (about 13 yards deep) and the quarterbacks throws the ball to his left or right. The linebacker breaks on the ball. The key is to get reps and increase the difficulty of picking the ball off as the linebacker's reaction to the ball becomes better. Purpose: To have the linebacker drop into zones, square up and break on the football under control and in good football position.
