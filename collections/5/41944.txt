Knocking/rattle from front end when driving slow. 1  Ive developed a knocking/rattle noise coming from the front end of the car, its much more noticeable at low speeds (30mph and under), just uneven road makes it rattle it doesnt need to be a big pot-hole. ive checked the front springs, drop links, track rod ends everything seems to be ok.
