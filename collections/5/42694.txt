It is the first to specify quantitative criteria on dumping prices: a price 20 percent or more below the price on the domestic market in the country of origin or at least 8 percent lower than the price existing in the world market.umping is usually done to drive competitors off the market and secure a monopoly, or to hinder foreign competition.
