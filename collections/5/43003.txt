Indonesia's flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) was declared endangered in 2008, with no single population larger than 250 adults. As pressures increase, more felines will suffer. And as time progresses, we will probably have a few extinctions to report, because for too many of these species their nine lives are drawing to a close.
