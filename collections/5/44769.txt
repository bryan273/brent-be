The color of their fur is also  an adaptation. Because the environment they live in is mostly  white, they have produced white fur to blend in, so they are not  seen by the prey they hunt.    Adaptation is powered by natural selection.When a trait arises  that allows an organism to better adapt to their environment, it  will be passed on to the next generation. Over time this trait will  accumulate in the population.ithin a population of animals there are variations and differences. So when an environmental change occurs those animals that are better suited to that environment survive a â€¦ nd are able to reproduce sucessfully.
