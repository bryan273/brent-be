Michael Buble – You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby lyrics. You must have been a beautiful baby. You must have been a wonderful child. When you were only starting to go to kindergarten. I bet you drove those other childs wild. And when it came to winning blue ribbons. I bet you taught those other kids how. I can see the judges' eyes when they handed you the prize.
