Heck, being named to the World Cup team would be a big financial boost even for Matt Besler (MLS salary: $200,000, second-lowest among MLS players in camp), and Besler is one of only six U.S. players I’d consider a lock to start in Brazil if healthy.nstead of earning a minimum $76,000 for making the World Cup team, the windfall would be a minimum $3,000 (for any player who’s in camp but doesn’t make the gameday roster for the first two pre-Cup friendlies).
