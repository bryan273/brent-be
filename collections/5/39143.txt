Zip Code Map. Many Nashville neighborhoods don’t have well-defined boundaries. When searching for Nashville real estate online, I think it’s smart to use Zip Codes and/or School Zones as your main search criteria. This way, you are seeing every option. I found this map in the Yellow Pages years ago and scanned it. I’ve never found a better one.
