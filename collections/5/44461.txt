The Indians were rewarded with an additional pick in the 2016 Draft thanks to the fourth annual Competitive Balance Lottery. Two portions of Major League Baseball's 2016 First-Year Player Draft were set Wednesday when the Competitive Balance Lottery was held at the Commissioner's Office in New York. The Red Sox signed 27 of the 39 players they selected in the 2015 Draft, including all 16 players taken in the first 17 rounds.
