Mimmy Jain of The Indian Express, in a positive review, wrote, Fiza is the kind of movie that every critic prays will never come his way. For a critic's job, after all, is to criticise. And Fiza offers little scope for criticism.. She further noted Karisma for delivering a superbly flawless performance.arisma Kapoor in particular was applauded for her performance as a disillusioned sister. Vinayak Chakravorty from Hindustan Times gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, Fiza is more than just about Khalid Mohamed's foray into filmmaking.
