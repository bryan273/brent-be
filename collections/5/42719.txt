A circular bacterial chromosome is a bacterial chromosome in the form of a molecule of circular DNA. Unlike the linear DNA of most eukaryotes, typical bacterial chromosomes are circular. circular bacterial chromosome, showing DNA replication proceeding bidirectionally, with two replication forks generated at the origin. Each half of the chromosome replicated by one replication fork is called a replichore. (Graphic computer art by Daniel Yuen).
