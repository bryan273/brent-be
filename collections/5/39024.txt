Give Hand-Pollination a Try! This well-pollinated cucumber plant is growing a new cucumber. The fruit comes from the female flower, pollinated by pollen transferred from a male flower, like the bright yellow one above. Ideally, pollen is transferred by bees, but if not, hand-pollination is an option.
