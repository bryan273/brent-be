Genome duplication must occur before cell division, so that both progeny cells inherit a complete copy of the genetic material. DNA replication is initiated at particular chromosomal sites called origins, after the binding and recruitment of several initiation proteins.hromosomes must be faithfully duplicated in each cell-division cycle to ensure genome integrity. The in vitro reconstitution of DNA-replication initiation in yeast allows mechanistic studies of this fundamental process.
