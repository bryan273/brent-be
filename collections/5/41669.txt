Many people worry about getting too little iron—for good reason. Iron, after all, is essential to life. Most iron in our bodies is incorporated in hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood, and in myoglobin in muscle, but every living cell has and needs iron to function. Iron is also stored in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Without it, your cells would become starved for oxygen, your brain and muscles wouldn’t function, and your immune system would be impaired, among other problems.
