A couplet is a pair of rhymed lines of poetry. Such pairs can occur on their own, as short poems or aphorisms, or strung together as long poems or combined with other poetic forms, most commonly as the final lines of an English-style, or Shakespearean, sonnet.n elegiac couplets is an older form, favored by classical writers; it comprises one line of dactylic hexameter and one of pentameter, with a brief pause, or caesura, in the middle. In both cases, the couplets are closed, meaning that each pair of lines constitutes a single thought or complete sentence.
