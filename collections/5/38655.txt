Immediately, measure and record the heart rate and breathing rate as before. f Take the heart rate and breathing rate again at 2 minutes after exercise and 4 minutes after exercise. (If you have a pulse meter, you may be able to record pulse rate during exercise too, e.g. after 2 minutes, adding this to your table). The pulse-taker and â€˜breathing-rate counter take heart rate and breathing rate measurements as before. They do this immediately after exercise has stopped, then 2 minutes after exercise stopped and then 4 minutes after exercise stopped. These rates should be taken with the exerciser sitting down.
