The term medical marijuana is a misnomer. While itâ€™s been handed out to more than a million so-called patients in 23 states, marijuana bears no resemblance to anything else in their medicine cabinets. Its use is not well-regulated or-understood, and states have done a poor job of tracking what, exactly, is being doled out at its dispensaries.
