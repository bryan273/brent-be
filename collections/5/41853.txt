They abbreviate only “Street,” “Avenue,” and “Boulevard, making them “St.,” “Ave.,” and “Blvd.” But they only abbreviate these terms when they appear with an exact street address. If the street name stands alone, the street name shouldn’t be abbreviated. So, according to this style, you’d write: The museum is at 281 3rd St., at the corner of 3rd Street and Wilshire Boulevard. Newspapers don’t use postal codes for states.
