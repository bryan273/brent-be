Quite a few students with grades and test scores that were on target for FSU did not get accepted. You'll also see that several students were accepted with test scores and grades a bit below the norm. This is largely because Florida State takes into consideration the rigor of your high school courses, not just your grades. The university likes to see a minimum of four units of English and math, three unites of natural science and social science, and two units of a world language.
