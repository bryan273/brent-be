A doctor, applying the AMA guidelines, might conclude that you have a 20% permanent impairment in that hand. Your state’s workers’ compensation law might provide for a $100,000 payment for a complete loss of use of a hand, so your permanent impairment would be worth $20,000 (100,000 x 20%). Some states also allow permanent impairment awards for scarring.
