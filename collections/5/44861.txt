It would be great if one day a good St Augustine grass seed was developed. There are a number of different St Augustine varieties that are available for the public. Breeding is being done to improve the grass and to make a more SAD and chinch bug resistant turf. The chinch bug is very small insect, but a major pest.he plugs should be place from 6 to 12 inches apart. St Augustine grass can be plugged at 24 inches apart, but will take longer to fill in. If using stolons, the stolons must be covered over with a thin layer of dirt except for the grass blades. This encourages rooting.
