Consider 1300-Hz sound waves diffracted by a door that is 84 cm wide. What is the angle between the two first-order diffraction minima? 39. • Green light (λ=546 nm) strikes a single slit at normal incidence. What width slit will produce a central maximum that is 2.50 cm wide on a screen 1.60 m from the slit? 40.
