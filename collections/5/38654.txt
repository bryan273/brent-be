The recovery heart rate is the amount of time it takes the heart to return to normal bpm rates after an exercise session is over (usually about one minute.) With the recovery heart rate, the healthier a person is the quicker their bpm returns to normal.he best way to check you recovery heart rate is to first record your heart rate before an exercise. Next get on a stationary bike or treadmill for about 1 minute to record a simple test. Tests that are more formal require you to exercise until you are tired. During the exercise the heart rate is monitored also.
