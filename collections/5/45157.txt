A pseudostratified columnar epithelium is a special type of simple epithelium that consists of a falsely-stratified single layer of epithelial cells resting on a basement membrane. Many, if not most, of the cells, are columnar. Ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (Respiratory Epithelium) lines the upper respiratory tract. 2  Nonciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium lines the epididymis of the male reproductive system.
