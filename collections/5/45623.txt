Why do many Delta flights have short layovers (30-40 minutes)? I'm flying Delta for the first time and was concerned about a ~35-minute layover at ATL, so I looked online for others' experiences. It sounds like the standard Delta layover is either 40 minutes or 2 hours. What is the rationale behind this?
