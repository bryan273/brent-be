Most bacterial chromosomes contain a circular DNA molecule â€“ there are no free ends to the DNA. Free ends would otherwise create significant challenges to cells with respect to DNA replication and stability. circular bacterial chromosome, showing DNA replication proceeding bidirectionally, with two replication forks generated at the origin. Each half of the chromosome replicated by one replication fork is called a replichore. (Graphic computer art by Daniel Yuen).
