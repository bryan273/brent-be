There are a number of rules to be followed in official Commission publications (see in particular the OPOCE style guide). The full term ‘euro’ is used when there is no direct reference to the amount, e.g. in table/graph footnotes (such as ‘The euro became the new currency for 15 Member States’. In English and German, the term euro (German: Euro) is never written in plural. In French, a plural ‘s’ is added (euros). In English and French, euro starts with a lower case letter, in German with an upper case letter. If there is a reference to an amount, the ISO 4217 code of euro ‘EUR’ is used (such as ‘EUR 30’).
