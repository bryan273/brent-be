Drinking before you run. One way to minimise dehydration is to ensure that you begin a long run fully hydrated. In the days before a big race, it is a good idea to sip as much water as you can to keep your body topped up. On the day of the run, drink up to two hours before the start. Most experienced runners stop then, to avoid the need to urinate while they are running. You can begin drinking again immediately before the start.
