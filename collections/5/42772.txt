An adiabatic process will not be exothermic. Exothermic refers to a process in which a system releases energy (heat) to the surroundings, i.e. Q < 0 (where Q is heat enteringâ€¦ the system) Adiabatic refers to any process occurring without gain or loss of heat within a system, i.e. Q = 0. An exothermic reaction can be carried out in an adiabatic system however. The energy released from the reaction will result in a rise in temperature within the system since none of the energy is released to the surroundings.
