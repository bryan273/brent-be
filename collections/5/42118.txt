Its chemical formula is HO 2 CCH(NH 2)CH 2 CH(CH 3) 2. L-Leucine is encoded by six codons (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG) and is a major component of the subunits in ferritin, astacin, and other 'buffer' proteins. L-Leucine is an essential amino acid, meaning that the human body cannot synthesize it, and it therefore must be ingested.
