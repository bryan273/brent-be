Calorie intake during pregnancy. I was on a mission to get healthier and lose weight before my husband and I conceived again. I had gestational diabetes with my first born and want to do everything I can to prevent it in the next one. (I know there's not much I can do but every little bit helps) I am on a 1200 cal diet and have lost 15lbs. :) We found out we are pregnant, yay!!!
