Glucose and oxygen are delivered to the cells by the bloodstream. Carbon dioxide and water are removed from the cells by the bloodstream. Water can remain in the cell or leave as needed. ATP remains in the cytoplasm as a source of energy for the cell to do work. In mitochondria, glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide and water as ATP is produced.
