Review of Temptation Cancun Resort. Temptation Cancun Resort. Just got back from our 6th trip to Temptation. We love this place because you meet such friendly people and meet people from all walks of life. The staff is amazing and always have a smile. We spent a lot of time at the quiet pool and I loved relaxing and reading by the pool.
