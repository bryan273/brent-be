Contemporary Maker Marks. Fenton Marks. When Fenton introduced its lines or reissued Carnival Glass in 1970, they marked the glass with an oval with the word Fenton in script inside. In 1980, they reduced the size of the mark and included a numeral designating the decade (8 for 1980s, 9 for 1990s, 0 for 2000).
