Shiva (Judaism) Shiva (Hebrew: שבעה‎‎, literally seven) is the week-long mourning period in Judaism for first-degree relatives: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse. The ritual is referred to as sitting shiva. Immediately after burial, people assume the halakhic status of avel (Hebrew: אבל; mourner).
