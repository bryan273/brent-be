1 Seat height: On an upright bike, start by adjusting your seat to about the height of your hip. Have a seat, placing your feet on/into the pedals. 2  With one leg fully extended (foot flat and parallel to the floor), you should have only a small bend in your kneeâ€”about 5-10 degrees. The first option, an upright bike, is like a regular bicycle (your legs extend below your torso and your back is not supported), only stationary. 2  Recumbent bikes offer a more relaxed, supported sitting position.
