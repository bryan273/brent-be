â€¢ The volume of carbon dioxide is the same as the volume of the flask, which is equal to the. volume of water in the flask. This volume is obtained from the mass and the density of the. water. The mass of the water is the difference between the mass (flask + foil + water) and. the mass (empty flask + foil).
