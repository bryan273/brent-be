The Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, which bears the name of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, court documents show. Owned by developer Empresas Diaz, the club uses the Trump name under a licensing agreement. Donald Trump does not own the club. We merely licensed our name for a fee and have nothing to do with the ownership, development or entity, Eric Trump, executive vice president of The Trump Organization and son of Donald Trump, said in a statement.
