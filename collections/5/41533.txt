This was a really really random short flick with my friend Tommy. We were just playing around with the Konova Slider, and the TommyJib 4ft Crane when we realized how well the footage worked with this song by Edwin Starr. Camera: Canon 60D. Lens: Tokina 11-16mm, Canon 50mm F1.8 II with DIY Vari-ND Fader.
