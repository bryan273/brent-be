By 1962, John Paul & George realised that Ringo was the drummer they needed. Ringo was the last to join the Beatles and thus, the band was complete. Within a year they were stars in Britain and Europe and the year after that they conquered the rest of the world. Ringo was also responsible for the song titles of 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Tomorrow Never Knows'.
