The inside diameter of your mastbase (the part where you need to shove you mast base or mast extension in) is smaller as well, so you need to have a new mast foot and/or mast extension. Then you needed a new boom in the beginning, now all booms come with mast shims to fit them tightly onto the slimmer diameters.
