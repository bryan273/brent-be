A displacement boats theoretical hull speed is when the wave length is equal to the waterline length. The important thing here is the length of the wave is relative to the length of the boat. The SL Ratio is a simple formula for calculating displacement boats speed which is typically 1.34. Velocity = (g * Length / 2 pi) ^ ½. g = acceleration of gravity (32.15 ft/sec ^2) Convert ft./sec. to Knots and the result is 1.34 * L^½.
