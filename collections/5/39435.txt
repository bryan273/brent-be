Historic Eruptions of the Kameni islands, Santorini The Kameni islands have erupted seven times in the past five hundred years. Each of these eruptions has shown a similar pattern, starting with the growth of a lava dome and the slow extrusion of thick flows of lava, accompanied by intermittent but violent ash and steam explosions both from the vent, and as the lava flows enter the sea.
