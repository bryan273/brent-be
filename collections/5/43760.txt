Google Drive: Presentation (Web). Like any good office suite, Google Drive has the three top tools: a word processor, a spreadsheet, and of course, a presentation package that we'll call Presentation even though it doesn't seem to have a specific name. Coupled with the service's online storage capabilities, it's a hard package to beat.
