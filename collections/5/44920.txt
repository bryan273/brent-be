Over the summer and fall months, the Assessor from Danby Township, along with a member of her staff, will be conducting property field reviews. They will be measuring all buildings, porches, decks and driveways. The State of Michigan requires that every Township keep updated and accurate records of all property. Townships are recommended to visit 20% of their properties every year. These field reviews are a critical component in calculating a fair, accurate and up-to-date value of each and every property.
