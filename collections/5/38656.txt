To calculate your maximum heart rate subtract your age from 220. During an exercise session your heart rate should be around 100 to 150 bpm (50 percent to 85 percent target heart zones.) The target heart zone lets you measure your fitness level and monitor your progress in a fitness program.he best way to check you recovery heart rate is to first record your heart rate before an exercise. Next get on a stationary bike or treadmill for about 1 minute to record a simple test. Tests that are more formal require you to exercise until you are tired. During the exercise the heart rate is monitored also.
