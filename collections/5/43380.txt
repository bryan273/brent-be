In the words of Dr Llaila Afrika, melanin is a civilising chemical inside the body that actually puts things and organises things to go to the right place at the right time. Melanin does not die, as ancient egyptian remains have been found with traces of melanin still present.itamin D-Is needed for calcium absorbtion and this is converted from the sun's UV rays and us melaninated beings require at least 20 minutes daily sunlight on at least the face and arms (preferably not washing until at least 30minutes after to allow absorbtion into the bloodstream).
