The hematocrit (/hᵻˈmætəkrᵻt/) (Ht or HCT), also known by several other names, is the volume percentage (vol%) of red blood cells in blood. It is normally 45% for men and 40% for women. It is considered an integral part of a person's complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and platelet count.
