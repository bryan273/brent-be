Wonthaggi is located in South Gippsland, several kilometres inland from the coast and between the seaside towns of Kilcunda and Inverloch. Between 1909 and 1968, black coal was mined from Wonthaggi's network of underground mines, creating a thriving industrial settlement for miners and their families during those years.
