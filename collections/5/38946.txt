We’ve reported in the past about the difference between cognac and vodka, so continuing in this series, we’re now going to talk about the difference between our favorite spirit Cognac and Rum – and see which one of the two, in our humble opinion, is the more superior…. As you well know, cognac is produced from grapes. Rum on the other hand is the result of distilled sugar cane byproducts such as molasses or the fermented juice of the plant. Now, we may be a little biased in this respect, but the tending of vines and grapes is arguably far more of a skill than growing sugar cane.
