Don’t forget that …. While the use of the phrases “repudiation of a claim” and “repudiation of liability” are common in the insurance industry it is preferable, and correct to use the terms “rejection of a claim” and “denial of liability”. That it is because there is specific meaning to the term “repudiation” of a contract.
