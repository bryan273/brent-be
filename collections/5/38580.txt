Pairing your pork chops with a starch can ensure that your meal is hearty and very filling for everyone. Try a mix of long-grain and wild rice with diced mixed vegetables as a side, or bake the pork chops with rice, adding water or broth and your favorite seasonings. The rice will absorb the seasonings, as well as the meat juices. If you're short on time, opt for pasta.
