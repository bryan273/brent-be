The Field. The battlefield of Waterloo was small by the standards of the day, being three miles long and a mile deep. Wellington had occupied an excellent position, the main feature being the ridge of Mont St. Jean that ran from east to west. The ridgeâ€™s front was fairly steep, but could be traversed by both infantry and cavalry.
