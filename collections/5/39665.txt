A simple way to identify the location of the headache is to look at the position in relation to the parts of the skull, particularly the cranium. 1  Top of the head = parietal; vertex is the top most part. 2  Back of the head = occipital. 3  Side of the head = temporal. 4  Front of the head = frontal.
