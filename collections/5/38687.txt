Sure, you have 2 options below to get your long-term Visas in Vietnam: 1 - You apply for a 3 month multiple entry visa - either through our online service or through Vietnamese Embassy in US. When you are in Vietnam, you can extend your exisiting visa for further 3 months. 2 - If you marry a Vietnamese girl, you are eligible to apply for a 5-year visa exemption through the Government website below: http://mienthithucvk.mofa.gov.vn/. We hope that helps.
