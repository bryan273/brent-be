Several walls,  referred to as the Great Wall of China, were built since the 5th  century BC. The most famous is the wall built between 200 BC - 220  BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang; little of it  remains; it was much farther north than the current wall, which was  built during the Ming Dynasty.
