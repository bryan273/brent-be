Preparing the Surgical Sites Patient preparation should be performed in an area other than on the surgery table. Chapter 14, Lesson 4, Preparing Hands and the Field of Operation, covers preparation of the surgical site on the patient. If this pre-operative procedure was appropriately situated in another room, the assistant will now need to clean the prep area. Vacuum, scrub, and disinfect table surfaces and sweep, vacuum, and mop the floor. The assistant should leave the prep area in readiness for the next patient.
