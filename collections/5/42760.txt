Another great area for foodies! Atlanta has more great restaurants spread out in every neighborhood; its great! Whether you want five star, or sidewalk cafe with your dog, atlanta has it for foodies of all kinds. The diversity of ethnic food is wonderful and its great to see that they are well supportedby tourists and locals alike.
