   Adaptation is powered by natural selection. When a trait arises  that allows an organism to better adapt to their environment, it  will be passed on to the next generation. Over time this trait will  accumulate in the population.t can  also refer to a physical or genetic trai â€¦ t that helps an organism to  be better suited to survive in their environment.    For example, polar bears are adapted to living in the cold because  they grow thick fur that keeps them warm, and thus allows them to  survive in their frigid environment.
