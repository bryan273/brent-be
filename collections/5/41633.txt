Seligman and colleagues drew their reformulated model not from the learned helplessness paradigm, but rather from that body of literature known as attribution theory (e.g., Jones et al., 1972). Attribution theory is concerned with the way people attribute causality to events.aier and Seligman (1976) listed alternative explanations of the helplessness effect in animals. For example, there was the theory that inescapable shock is an extreme stressor that depletes a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement.
