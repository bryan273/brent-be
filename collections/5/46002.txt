The cost of LASEK is similar to the cost of LASIK; typically about $1,000 to $2,300 for traditional LASEK or $2,500 to $4,000 for custom LASEK. Complications associated with LASEK eye surgery are rare, and there is less risk of complications than with LASIK because there is no incision made in the cornea.
