Remember that they're is a contraction of the words they and are. It can never be used as a modifier, only as a subject (who or what does the action) and verb (the action itself).1  They're my best friends. Remember there, their, and they're by the following rules: 2  t here: the word here is in there so refer to there as a word for location. 3  t he ir: the word he is in their so refer to their as a word for people.
