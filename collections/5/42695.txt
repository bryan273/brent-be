Mays was one of these new Norman names. It was specifically tailored to its first bearer, who was a person born or baptized in the month of May. The name Mays is derived from the Old French word mai, which has cognates in the other European languages that were all derived from the Latin word Maius. This name was also a nickname for a person with a particularly sunny disposition or a person who had an anecdotal connection with the month of May.
