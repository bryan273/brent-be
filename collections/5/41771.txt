A lot of people interchange the words ‘autobiography’ and ‘memoirs’ during conversations. While informally this is accepted, there are certain obvious distinctions between the both words because of which certain non-fictions are titled autobiographies whereas others are called memoirs. Autobiography refers to a self written account of one’s life from birth until the time of writing.
