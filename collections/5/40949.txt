You can correct high water pressure by installing a pressure reducing valve. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure. Aim for water pressure that is 60-70 PSI. If the house has low pressure, you first want to determine if the house is on a public water supply system or a private well system. Most public systems are required to deliver a minimum of 30 PSI to your house, so inadequate pressure on public water systems is rare.
