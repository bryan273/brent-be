The hand brake on the City Select makes it easy for parents to park on a dime! Located on the right side of the handlebar frame, it takes a simple lift of the brake latch to lock your stroller in place. There is no longer the need to fumble with locks on wheel axles â€“ just simply lift the hand brake!
