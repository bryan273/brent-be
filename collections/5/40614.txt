The Blue Screen of Death is a fatal system error that has been in every version of Windows since Windows 3.1. Microsoft has pulled security updates that break critical Windows system processes in the recent past. In 2010, the software maker turned off the Automated Update mechanism while its engineers investigated a patch that caused the Blue Screen of Death condition in Windows XP.
