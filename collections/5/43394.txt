Dirty Wars is based on a book by journalist Jeremy Scahill, who also authored the best-selling Blackwater: The Rise of the Worldâ€™s Most Powerful Mercenary Army, a story that helped to crack the lid of the Blackwater scandal. In some ways, Dirty Wars can be viewed as a continuation of this earlier book.
