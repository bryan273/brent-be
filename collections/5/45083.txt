It is not a marching song. It is not necessarily defiant. It is a promise: We shall overcome someday. Deep in my heart, I do believe.. It has been a civil rights song for 50 years now, heard not just in the U.S. but in North Korea, in Beirut, in Tiananmen Square, in South Africa's Soweto Township. But We Shall Overcome began as a folk song, a work song.
