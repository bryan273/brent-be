Pottery & Porcelain Marks â€“ Shield: Marks that look like shields were used from the late 18th century to the present. Cylindrical shapes with a few horizontal lines inside were the earliest shield marks. Over time, the shield became more decorative. From 1774 to 1864, the Royal Vienna Porcelain factory used the Beehive Vienna Mark.
