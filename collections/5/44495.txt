o Starch: alpha linkages, and branched The branching in glycogen allows for quick mobilization of glucose for energy. 11. Animals store energy as either a carbohydrate or a lipid. Why would an animal use both these molecules for energy storage? What structural differences facilitate their different uses? Carbohydrates: short term storage; branched for quick mobilization Lipids: long term storage; They are more reduced than carbohydrates yielding more energy per carbon, and they are hydrophobic, thus stored anhydrously, so there is more carbon per gram of lipids. Thus, they yield more energy/gram than carbohydrates. 12.
