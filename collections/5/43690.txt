Heroic couplets are pairs of iambic pentameter, a form favored by Geoffrey Chaucer and by the 17th-and 18-century English poets, notably Alexander Pope.n elegiac couplets is an older form, favored by classical writers; it comprises one line of dactylic hexameter and one of pentameter, with a brief pause, or caesura, in the middle. In both cases, the couplets are closed, meaning that each pair of lines constitutes a single thought or complete sentence.
