J. D. Tippit was one of the few officers in the Dallas Police Force not to be called to Dealey Plaza to help investigate the assassination. Instead, at 12.45 p.m. he was sent to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. At 1.16 p.m. Tippit approached a man, later identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, walking along East 10th Street.
