Artist: Bing Crosby. Album: You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby. You must have been a beautiful baby. You must have been a wonderful child. When you were only starting to go to kindergarten. I bet you drove the little boys wild. And when it came to winning blue ribboms. You must have shown the other kids how.
