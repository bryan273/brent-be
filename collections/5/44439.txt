The given name is the single name by which a person would be known, such as Istvan (Stephen), Janos (John), Miklos (Nicholaus). Most given names in medieval and Renaissance Hungary are variants of Christian names common throughout Europe, though there are also many of Latin, German, and Slavic origin.n Hungary, it is common practice to write your family name first, followed by your given name (which for obvious reasons is not called a first name, as it is in America!). This practice is a result of Hungarian grammar and the way in which family names originated.
