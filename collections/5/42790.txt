The insurer denies liability in respect of the claim because the policy has been avoided by reason of material misrepresentation or non-disclosure. When an insurer rejects a claim relying on application of an exclusion clause, or because the claim does not fall within the operative clause of the policy, that is not a repudiation of the contract. In these circumstances the insurer does not deny the existence of the contract of insurance but denies liability under the contract.
