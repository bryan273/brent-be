There are several reasons that may be causing a strong knocking sound from the driverâ€™s side front wheel and this sound is likely attributed to an issue with the brakes, steering, and suspension. 1  Struts/Strut Mounts - The suspension strut is attached to the vehicle by the strut mount. It reduces the sound and vibrations of the tires and stabilizes the steering system. If the struts/strut mounts have worn out, broken, or damaged a knocking sound may be heard when driving on rough roads or driving over bumps.
