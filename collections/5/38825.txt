Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79 Br (50.69%) and 81 Br (49.31%). At least 23 radioisotopes are known. Many of the bromine isotopes are fission products. Several of the heavier bromine isotopes from fission are delayed neutron emitters, important to the controllability of a nuclear reactor.s a result, many organobromide compounds that were formerly in common use—such as the pesticide, methyl bromide —have been abandoned. Bromine compounds are still used for purposes such as in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals.
