Holidays in Naxos. Naxos is the largest island of Cyclades and it is located in the center of this complex, between Paros and Mykonos. According to mythology, this was the nuptial isle of the god Dionysus, god of wine. This is why there is a sanctuary dedicated to Dionysus in the inland of Naxos island.
