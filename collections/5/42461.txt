The year 1100 B.C. or so marked the end of higher civilization in the Aegean for a long time. The succeeding period (1100-750 B.C.) is conventionally called the Dark Ages of Greece, and it is aptly named. Because writing disappeared along with Mycenaean civilization, no written evidence exists for this period.y the end of the Dark Ages, most Greeks came to have a genos (- e) or clan as well. A clan is a group of families that trace their relations to one, often mythical or semi-mythical, ancestor. Clans may not have existed in the early Dark Ages, but the Greeks did have tribes.
