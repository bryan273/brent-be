But at about 4°C it reaches a maximum density and then decreases in density as it approaches the freezing point. This decrease in density is only about one part in 10,000 as it cools from 4°C to 0°C, but this is sufficient to cause the water near freezing to come to the top. The water further expands upon freezing, so that water freezes from the top down, and ice floats on water.
