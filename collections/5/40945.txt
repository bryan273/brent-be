Turn off all faucets and appliances that use water -- washing machines, refrigerators with ice makers, sprinkler systems and dishwashers. When you test water pressure with a gauge, you are testing the static water pressure, and if there is water moving anywhere in your plumbing system, you may get a false low reading.
