The scales of this fish take on a metallic sheen that is not present in the Gulf opaleye. The habitat of sea chubs is highly varied, although most are reef grazers picking at both algae and small invertebrates. One subfamily, Kyphosinaae, also known as the rudderfishes, exists more often in the pelagic environment.
