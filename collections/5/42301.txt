Here are some warning signs and red flags that this is a scam: 1  The IRS would never call you first on the phone. 2  The fake agent uses a very common name, like John Smith, Bob Jones, etc. and provides a (fake) badge number. 3  The fake agent knows the last 4 digits of your social security number, but NOTthe entire number.
