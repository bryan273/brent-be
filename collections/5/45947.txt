Today's hearing aids are smaller and more sophisticated than they used to be. There are dozens of styles from which to choose, from behind-the-ear (BTE) models to instruments about the size of a pearl, called completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids. A CIC instrument hides within your ear canal, totally out of sight. Your perfect style depends on your lifestyle, listening preferences, and more.
