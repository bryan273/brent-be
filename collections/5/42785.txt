It is crucial that the claimant or broker/agent be aware of the claims process and of any potential obstacles, and what procedure to follow in the event of a repudiated claim, or the ombudsman will have very little chance of a successful claim. RC (Repudiated Claims) can be of assistance in dealing with claims promptly. Our legal associates specialise in Repudiated Claims, although from past experience, we are often able to bypass the legal process. All claims are reviewed by Vensysâ€™ Directors to ensure the proper approach is recommended, and agreed on, by the client.
