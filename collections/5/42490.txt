In a great episode of Family Guy, the show went back to its roots by bringing back our favorite evil baby. If anyone’s been wondering, like myself, just why Stewie has stopped trying to kill Lois and traveling back in time, it’s because Stewie has a weakness: his feet. This is what we learned on The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair.. By trying to infuse himself with evil, Stewie accidentally creates an evil clone of himself, the only difference being the reverse colors of his overalls and shirt. In an epic fight of evil naked babies, Original Stewie and Evil Stewie battle for Brian and the right to be the only evil baby on the show.
