In zinc-carbon or alkaline types they produce around 1.5 volts per cell when fresh. Other types produce other voltages per cell (as low as 1.2 volts for rechargeable nickel-cadmium, up to around 3 volts for lithium/manganese dioxide). This form has a positive nub terminal at the cap of the cell, and the negative terminal at the bottom of the can; the side of the can is not used as a terminal.
