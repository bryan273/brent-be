The axle has a smaller radius than the wheel.A wheel-and-axle is a complex lever system, with the center of the wheel-and-axle serving as the fulcum. The radii of the two parts are the arms of a lever. A lever is more efficient than a wheel-and-axle because a lever does not need to overcome the force of friction.
