Beltone is part of a network of dealers around the country. The stores are typically owned by a Beltone dealer who has the rights to sell Beltone hearing aids in a certain geographic area. They are a “captive network”, meaning they typically offer only Beltone brand hearing aids. Beltone offices don’t carry hearing aids from manufacturers such as ReSound, Starkey, Siemens, etc. If you want a Beltone hearing aid you have to get it from a Beltone dealer; if you want to choose from other brands you have to go somewhere else.
