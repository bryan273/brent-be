The scanner software attempts to exploit each vulnerability that is discovered. Running a vulnerability scan can pose its own risks as it is inherently intrusive on the target machineâ€™s running code. As a result, the scan can cause issues such as errors and reboots, reducing productivity. There are two approaches to vulnerability scanning, authenticated and unauthenticated scans.
