You should have at least one gallon of water per person per day in your. emergency stockpile. That means if you have three people in your family, you. should have nine gallons stored, for example. And thatâ€™s just for drinking. The average American uses 80 gallons to 100. gallons of water per day, including flushing the. toilet, showering, handwashing and cooking. In. the case of a storm or unexpected water supply. interruption in your community, you could be without. water much longer than three days.
