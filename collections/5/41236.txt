Rip currents are channeled currents of water ï¬‚ owing away. from shore at surf beaches. They typically extend from near the. shoreline, through the surf zone and past the line of breaking waves. (The surf zone is the area between the high tide level on the beach to. the seaward side of breaking waves.)
