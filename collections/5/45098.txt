On the surface of the earth, nothing can move along a straight line, instead the plates rotate around a point on the surface. The pacific plate rotates around a point south of Australia. Around Hawaii, the plate is moving at about 7 cm/year, or about as fast as finger mails grow. The evidence for this motion is pretty convincing: earthquakes: earthquakes occur on the boundaries of the plates as they rub past each other.
