Unlike hard shell clams (known here as quahogs, cherry stones, or little necks, depending on their size), steamers have rather thin, brittle shells, so you have to be gentle with them. The two sides of the shell donâ€™t close all the way. Instead, protruding from the shell is a long foot, or siphon.
