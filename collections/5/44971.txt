DNA is the hereditary material that contains instructions to build a human being. DNA can be collected from very small amounts of blood, mouth (cheek) scrapings, hair roots, or other samples. There are two kinds of DNA in the body: nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Both kinds of DNA can be used for DNA identiÔ¨Åcation.
