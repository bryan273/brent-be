Dear Sandra, Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Regrettably I will not be able to attend due to some conflicting commitments. I'm sure it will be a wonderful event and worthy of Bill's remarkable commitment to CSF over the decades. With best regards, David Sahn Thank you for this information.
