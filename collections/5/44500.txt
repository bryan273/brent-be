Lipids are macromolecules that are all insoluble in water. They include oils and fats, phospholipids, and steroids. Oils are found in plants, where they are used for long term energy storage. Fats are found in animals where they also provide long term energy storage, as well as insulation. Fats and oils are composed of glycerol and fatty acids. A fatty acid is a long chain of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds, with a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end.
