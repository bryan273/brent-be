Octane ratings are posted on fuel dispensers. CAUTION: Follow the fuel recommendations in your vehicle owner's manual. If your vehicle requires premium 91 or higher octane fuel, use a premium grade of gasoline. The least amount that's necessary to prevent detonation (spark knock). On most vehicles, that would be regular unleaded 87 octane gasoline.
