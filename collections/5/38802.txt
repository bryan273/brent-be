These large crystals give the rock coarse (granite) to very coarse (pegmatite) texture. Granite typically has crystals of from 1 to 10 mm in size while pegmatite's crystals can be 10mm (1cm) and very much larger (see ESRT).They are non-vesicular (no gas pockets). Both are FELSIC and low density.ranite & Pegmatite. Both granite and pegmatite are made from the same minerals (pink zone in chart). These are silicates including potassium and plagioclase feldspars, quartz, biotite and amphibole.
