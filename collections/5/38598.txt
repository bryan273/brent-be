Remove the tub from the deck and for simplicity you can have a couple of 2 x 4’s nearby that you can set across the opening in your tile deck top to set the tub on temporarily. Mix some Portland cement powder, not concrete mix. You want a smooth cement mixture without aggregate.ou build a raised deck that comes up to the lip of the tub enclosing everything below. You can use tile or marble for the deck top that can be just a few inches larger than the tub or you could have several feet of extra tile top. It’s a nice place for plants or flowers or candles.
