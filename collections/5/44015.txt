There are many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause is often not identified. If a miscarriage happens during the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months), it's usually caused by problems with the unborn baby (foetus). About three in every four miscarriages happen during this period. If a miscarriage happens during the second trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 14 and 26), it may be the result of an underlying health condition in the mother. These late miscarriages may be caused by an infection around the baby, which leads to the bag of waters breaking before any pain or bleeding.
