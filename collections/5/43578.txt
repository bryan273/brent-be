Job order and process costing are adequate to determine the average cost of each unit produced. According to mdc.edu, the formula for unit cost calculation in a job order costing system is: Unit Cost = Total Job Cost / Number of Units Produced in Job. In many cases, such as the construction contractor example, only one unit is technically being produced per jobâ€”in this case one deck or one bathroom remodeling.
