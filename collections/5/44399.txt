Lunch at home: Some French people still go home at lunchtime, and many of these people eat a warm meal, usually not as fancy as the multi-course restaurant meal. Street lunch: As work schedules get tighter and commutes get longer, many more French people buy sandwiches on the street or in the train station at lunchtime.
