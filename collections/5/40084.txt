RE: Army contract ending. You'll be given the opportunity to reenlist before your contract ends. I've heard lately that the reenlistment window has changed but it used to be within 2 years of the end of your time in service. Even if you opt not to reenlist you're automatically in the Army Reserve for the remainder of your 8 year commitment.
