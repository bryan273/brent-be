Add a cup of grated cheese to the meatloaf mixture before baking, and another 1/2 cup over the top of the loaf during the last 15 minutes of baking. Add 1/3 cup of vegetable juice, wine, beef broth, or beer to the mixture for added flavor. 5. Soft bread crumbs make a more tender, juicier loaf than dry crumbs.
