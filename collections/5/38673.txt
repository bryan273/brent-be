Acidic foods such as tomato-based products and citrus fruits can intensify symptoms of a burning mouth, according to MayoClinic.com. Foods in this category can also cause pain if you have canker sores or other ulcerations in your mouth. In addition to the foods that you probably already associate with being acidic, refrain from drinking coffee and carbonated soft drinks which also measure high in acid and can cause you more pain.
