Filled with more than 100 bottles of wine, the Ultimate Wine Collection is an instant wine cellar! Wine is donated by participating wineries and the Lodi Grape Festival Board of Directors. Tickets are available at the Wine Show for $20. All proceeds benefit the Lodi Grape Festival Bucks for Books Scholarship Fund.
