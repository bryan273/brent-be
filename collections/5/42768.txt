An exothermic process is one that gives off energy when it occurs. A simple example of an exothermic process is the combustion of gasoline, because this process gives off a great deal of heat. In fancy mathematical terms, we would say that exothermic processes have negative âˆ†H values because the system is giving off the energy (i.e. losing energy to the surroundings).
