Since a given number of molecules always takes up the same volume for a gas, the higher the molecular weight, the heavier the gas is, or the higher the density. Carbon dioxide has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, and a molecular weight of 44 grams per mole ( a certain number of molecules). The oxygen in the air is actually O2, or molecular oxygen, with a molecular weight of 32. Hence, carbon dioxide has a higher density, or is heavier than oxygen. That is why you need to be careful with carbon dioxide. It can displace the oxygen in a room and lead to asphyxiation.
