Pegmatite is an exceptionally coarse-grained plutonic igneous rock. Most pegmatites have a mineralogical composition of granite but composition has no defining importance here. Pagmatites may have any imaginative magmatic composition and they are actually known to contain a large number of unusual minerals.egmatite is a very coarse-grained igneous rock.
