A answered. The blood vessels in your skin constrict or narrow in cold surroundings, this reduces the amount of heat lost through your skin in an attempt to maintain your internal temperature. Because of this the skin receives less blood and turns a bluish hue. The opposite will happen in warm surroundings, so the blood vessels will dilate or become larger in an attempt to cool the body. Thus the skin will appear more reddish.
