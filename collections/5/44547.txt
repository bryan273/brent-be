Early escalators had stairs made of wood – which happens to burn, unfortunately. One of the most notorious escalator accidents in history occurred on November 18th, 1987, when a fire fanned by drafts in London’s Underground subway network killed 31 people. The fire at King’s Cross St. Pancras station started beneath a wooden escalator built shortly after the Second World War.
