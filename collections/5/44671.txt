If you believe that there is still debris in the wound, this should be checked by a healthcare provider. If desired, apply an antibiotic cream or ointment. Cover the wound to protect it from dirt if necessary. Watch for signs of infection: redness around the wound, skin around the wound warm to touch, increased pain, and/or discharge from the wound. Consult your physician or nurse practitioner if you suspect you may have an infection.
