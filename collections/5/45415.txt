Here's the reason why Turkey is called Turkey. Well actually the word Turkey (country) came from England. The English said it was too hard to pronounce the word Turkiye I me â€¦ an all you have to say is turk-ee-air..That's what I hate about those pesky English fools.ctually you dont call Turkey the country as turkey the animal. you call the animal as Turkey. because the first turkey(hindi animal) comes from the country Turkey. lots of turkeys huh.
