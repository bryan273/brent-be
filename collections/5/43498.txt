Maxwell and Hertz. About 150 years ago, James Clerk Maxwell, an English scientist, developed a scientific theory to explain electromagnetic waves. He noticed that electrical fields and magnetic fields can couple together to form electromagnetic waves. Neither an electrical field (like the static which forms when you rub your feet on a carpet), nor a magnetic field (like the one that holds a magnet onto your refrigerator) will go anywhere by themselves.
