 These whole numbers are the subscripts in the empirical formula.  Use the molar mass of the compound to determine the scaling factor, and scale the empirical formula up to the molecular formula. Example: A compound is 43.7% P, and 56.3% O by mass, and has a molar mass of 283.88 g/mol. The molecular formula can be found from the empirical formula using the scaling factor if the molar mass of the compound is known (the molar mass can also be determined experimentally). Example: The molar mass of a compound with the empirical formula CH 2 O is 180.156 g/mol.
