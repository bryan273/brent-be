During a total solar eclipse, the solar corona can be seen by the naked eye. A corona (Latin, 'crown') is an aura of plasma that surrounds the sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, but it is also observable with a coronagraph. The word corona is a Latin word meaning crown, from the Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”).
