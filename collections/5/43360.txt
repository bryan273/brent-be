When I was planning my move to Chamblee this summer I noticed Club Pilates was on Google Maps well before the studio opened, so I was excited to join and be a part of the new location on opening day. Everything is A+ at Club Pilates - high quality instructors who get to know you personally, the best equipment, the great variety of classes available for all levels, and a well managed business.
