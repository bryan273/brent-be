When to Test. The best time to test gifted children is between the ages of 4 and 8. Testing before age 4 is likely to result in unreliable scores because a child's behavior is too unpredictable. Testing after age 8 can result in inaccurate scores. Inaccuracies can be caused by several factors, including test ceilings, perfectionism and underachievement.
