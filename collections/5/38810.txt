I didnâ€™t think it could be true. We ate at the restaurant and when the sun went down, we took off on a boat into the night. A few minutes later, you could see schools of fish glowing greenish-blue in the water. I put my hand in the water and that made it glow as well. Our guide suggested diving in and swimming around.
