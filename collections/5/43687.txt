A couplet may be formal (closed) or run-on (open).In a formal (or closed) couplet, each of the two lines is end-stopped, implying that there is a grammatical pause at the end of a line of verse.ouplets in iambic pentameter are called heroic couplets. John Dryden in the 16â€“17th century and Alexander Pope in the 18th century were both well known for their writing in heroic couplets.
