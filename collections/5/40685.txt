A couple of things to keep in mind with this defrosting method: -Some areas of the fridge are colder than others, which could prolong the thawing process. -After thawing in the fridge, poultry, ground meat and stew meat will stay good in the fridge for 1-2 days. Red meat cuts will stay good for up to 3-5 days. -You can refreeze meat thawed in the fridge. You may lose quality, but it will be safe for consumption. -Thaw meat on the bottom shelf to prevent juices from accidentally dripping onto other foods.
