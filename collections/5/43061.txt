Can Smoking Marijuana Cause a Stroke? Does marijuana usage increase someone's risk for having a stroke? Possibly, say international researchers studying a possible link between younger stroke patients and smoking pot. According to Dr. Valerie Wolff, marijuana-related stroke is not a myth, and healthcare professionals should consider the drug a risk factor for inducing ischemic stroke. Further, Wolff says, since many pot smokers are young, patients under 45 years of age showing symptoms of stroke should be tested for the drug.
