Fiona's max bench jumped from an unreal 170 kilos (375 pounds) to a wicked 180 kilos (397) in just two months. She competes in the 63-kilo class and weighs in at 64 kilos (142 pounds). Her routine consists of five weekly bench sessions with 50-80% of 1 RM poundages. Every three weeks, she does a very heavy max-load training session. Coaches and lifters who train with high frequency know this method is the holy grail of strength gains.
