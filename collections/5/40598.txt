Examples of Wheel and Axle: The large disc is the wheel, and the small cylinder or rod is the axle. There may be two wheels attached to the axle like in the image to the left, or it could be a single wheel and axle. The wheel is one of the greatest inventions in history, but it does not work without the axle.
