Yorkie with bloody stools. I have a Yorkshire Terrier. She is 14 years old and has always had issues on and off with her colon. I have changed foods many times which eliminates the problem for a while. For the last month she has had bloody loose stools. I started feeding her canned chicken which caused her to drink water excessively so I switched to fresh chicken. I have fed her fresh boiled chicken for the last 3 days and I added some yogurt to it because I understand it is good for the colon.
