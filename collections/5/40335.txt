Nothing is good enough if you don't follow basic computer security stuff... like not downloading untrusted crap, not opening unknown email attachments, not being gullible with all the spam and scam that arrives in email these days, keeping your browser and OS up to date with the latest security updates, etc.... If you do follow those safe practices, then it should be enough...
