At the Tonic, cranberries are dropped into the batter, and the finished financier is served warm between a tangy creme fraiche sorbet and a tart huckleberry chutney. At La Fourchette, a boat-shape ginger lemon financier is showered with powdered sugar, with creme fraiche ice cream and blueberries spooned on the side.ut such simplicity is deceiving: the classic French pastry called the financier is exquisitely refined. It is springy, sweet and nutty with an exterior that's as crisp as an eggshell. In France, financiers have been a staple of fine pastry shops for more than 100 years.
