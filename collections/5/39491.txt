A football pitch (also known as a football field or soccer field) is the playing surface for the game of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, The Field of Play. The surface can be either natural or artificial, but FIFA's Laws of the Game specify that all artificial surfaces must be painted green.
