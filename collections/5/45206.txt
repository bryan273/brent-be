As may be expected, fewer men than women call themselves a feminist outright. In addition, 24 percent of men say the term feminist is an insult, compared to 17 percent of women who say this. When the definition of a feminist is provided, however, 58 percent of men say they are a feminist.Men are divided in their views on whether the women's movement has made THEIR lives better.he number of men who say the women's movement has made their lives better is higher now than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1983, just 28 percent of men said the women's movement improved their lives and 30% said so in 1999. Today, men are less likely than women to say a strong women's movement is still needed.
