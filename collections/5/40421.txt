Jenner's experiment was a success. His patient failed to contract smallpox, even when deliberately exposed to variola. By 1800, cowpox vaccinations (the word vaccine is from the Latin vacca, for cow) were commonplace, primarily because they caused fewer side effects and deaths than variolation with smallpox itself.
