Individuals who are still married, may be considered unmarried for tax purposes if they meet certain requirements established by the IRS. A married taxpayer who wishes to file as Head of Household may not file a joint return. She must have contributed more than 50 percent of the upkeep of her home during the tax year. The taxpayer's spouse may not have lived in the taxpayer's home during the final six months of the tax year.
