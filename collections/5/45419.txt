  Answer Turkey is a bridge between Asia and Europe. It is surrounded  by the Mediterranean Sea, Aegean â€¦ Sea, Sea of Marmara and he Black  Sea. Turkey also borders Greece, Bulgaria, Iran, Iraq, Syria,  Armenia, Russia, and Georgia and the capital of Turkey is   Ankara, Turkey.ell actually the word Turkey (country) came from England. The English said it was too hard to pronounce the word Turkiye I mean all you have to say is turk-ee-air.. That's what I hate about those pesky English fools. They think they have the right to say any word their way!
