Obviously diet is the primary way that we are exposed to genetically modified foods. Those who eat mostly whole and organic foods donâ€™t have this problem. On the other hand, those people who eat a lot of processed foods, and/or non-organic foods are susceptible to developing these health issues due to GMOs. For example, about 90% of the corn and soy in the United States is genetically modified. And a lot of processed foods have corn and soy ingredients.
