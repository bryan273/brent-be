A bizarre natural phenomenon lights up the water off these three beaches, making the sea shine with a surreal blue light. As night falls on certain beaches around the world, the waves glow with an eerie blue light: tiny, neon dots that make it look as though stars are washing up on shore. The surreal scene arises not from magic, but from plankton that have evolved to glow in order to startle or distract fish and other potential predators.
