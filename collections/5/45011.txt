These are my favorite and have a chewy texture and a more nutty flavor than rolled oats. !/2 cup of oatmeal raw is about 150 calories. Cooking it will expand the volume but only because the oatmeal absorbs the liquid it is cooked in. As a rule of thumb it will about double in volume (1/2 cup raw = 1 cup cooked).
