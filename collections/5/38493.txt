Universal remote codes are used to operate the devices attached to them. Universal TV remote control codes are unique to each hardware device and are listed in the manuals provided with the appliance. All companies have a different and unique universal remote code that identifies a remote control with the TV set. In case the remote of the TV has broken or is lost, a new remote control which uses the same universal remote control codes can be used.
