Acylation reaction involves substitution by an electron donor (nucleophile) at the electrophilic carbonyl group (C=O). Common nucleophiles in the acylation reaction are aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, both of which give rise to esters and amines (RNH 2) which give amides.n substitutive chemical nomenclature, their names are formed by adding '-oyl' as a suffix to the name of the parent compound; ethanoyl chloride, CH 3 COCl, is an example. The terms acyl and aroyl halides refer to aliphatic or aromatic derivatives, respectively.
