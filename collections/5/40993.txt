If you experience pain, pressure or discomfort in the center of your chest or in your arms, back, jaw, neck or stomach — along with shortness of breath, a cold sweat, nausea, fatigue or lightheadedness — for at least five minutes, call 9-1-1. These symptoms may signal a heart attack, or myocardial infarction.
