Windows Defender is a part of your Windows 10 OS so you get it preinstalled in the system when you install the OS or buy the computer. It doesnâ€™t occupy extra space and cannot be removed from programs and features. You have no need to update Windows Defender separately as the update comes from this via Windows updates.
