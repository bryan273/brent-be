A major contributor to the field of geometry was Euclid - 325 BC who is typically known as the Father of Geometry and is famous for his works called The Elements. As one progresses through the grades, Euclidian geometry (Plane Geometry) is a big part of what is studied. However, non-Eucledian geometry will become a focus in the later grades and college math. Simply put, geometry is the study of the size, shape and position of 2-dimensional shapes and 3-dimensional figures. However, geometry is used daily by almost everyone. In geometry, one explores spatial sense and geometric reasoning.
