Get high-quality quail feed from a feed store or from online. Unlike other fowl, quail cannot eat low-quality feed without sacrificing quality. This is especially important when it comes to quail being raised for breeding and laying eggs. If you can't find high-quality quail feed, try a another type of game bird feed. You can also try turkey feed, which is usually higher in protein than chicken feed, making it more suitable for quail. Chicken feed can make a decent substitute for meat quail.
