Let's start with a few definitions. The empirical formula is the simplest formula for a compound. A molecular formula is the same as or a multiple of the empirical formula, and is based on the actual number of atoms of each type in the compound. H 4 S. The molar mass of the empirical formula is 84 g/mol. Since the molecular weight of the actual compound is 168 g/mol, and is double the molar mass of the empirical formula, the molecular formula must be twice the empirical formula:
