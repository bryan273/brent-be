Evaporated milk is often called for in recipes to produce a creamy texture. Custards are a good example of a dish that is made with evaporated milk. It thickens up the consistency of a dish without affecting the flavor. The main difference between evaporated milk and condensed milk is the sugar content. You may get confused if you go to buy condensed milk and all you can find are cans labeled “sweetened condensed milk.” Don’t waste your time trying to find unsweetened condensed milk, that’s just evaporated milk.
