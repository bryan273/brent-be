Longshore Currents, Shoreline, and Beach Drafts. Longshore currents are common at any beach that is exposed to breaking surf. A longshore current is an ocean current that moves parallel to shore. It is caused by large swells sweeping into the shoreline at an angle and pushing water down the length of the beach in one direction. Longsshore currents usually extend from the shallow waters inside the breaking waves to breaking waves on the outside.
