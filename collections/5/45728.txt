(dill) and to understand the germination behavior of the seeds in response to salinity, germination promoting chemicals, temperature, and light. For water uptake from salt solution five salinity concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 molar NaCl) and for. sucrose solution five concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 molar) were used.
