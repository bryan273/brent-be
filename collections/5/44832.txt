The Northern Song Empire was smaller than the Tang Empire.It didn't control an area of Central Asia that was controlled by the Tang Empire.fter about two decades of warfare, the Song capital was taken in 1276, and after three more years of fighting with remnants of the dynastic court, the empire ended in 1279. The Yuan Empire took its place. The Song Dynasty were defeated first by the Jin Empire and then by the Mongols.
