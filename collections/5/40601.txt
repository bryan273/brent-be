Anytime something moves in a circle, there is most likely a wheel and axle involved. Other examples of wheel and axle use include electric fans, motors, revolving doors, and merry-go-rounds, as well as the wheels used on skateboards, roller blades, cars, and many, many more objects. As with all simple machines like the wheel and axle, they are designed to help make work easier to do.
