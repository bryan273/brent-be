A Brachioplasty, or Arm Lift, is a surgical procedure designed to dramatically improve the appearance of the upper arm by removing loose or lax skin and tissue. The upper arm is sculpted to an aesthetically pleasing look, correcting arm shape in a manner that cannot be achieved through exercise alone.
