I know of two guys who remarried their ex-wives. Guess what? Neither remarriage worked out. The two couples wound up in divorce court again. Surprise. If anyone knows of people who successfully remarried each other, I'd like to hear about it. Why did they choose to remarry and how did they make it work?
