Binge eating disorder is usually common in bulimics, who binge eat and then get rid of it from their system, whether it be from using laxatives, making themselves throw up, or exercising excessively. It's also common in compulsive/binge eaters. They binge just like bulimics do, except they don't try to get rid of the food.
