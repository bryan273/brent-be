How much a player makes depends on the position he plays. While players at all positions make the league minimum, median pay is highest for forwards. In 2013, forwards made a median salary of $99,998. Goaltenders and mid-fielders made a median salary of $80,000, while defenders made two more dollars a year.he average salary in the MLS, however, was $160,000, and the median salary was $100,000. About 45 percent of MLS players -- that's 249 -- made over $100,000. The gap between the highest-paid and lowest-paid players is quite pronounced in professional soccer.
