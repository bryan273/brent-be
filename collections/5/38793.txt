Larger butterfly needles (i.e. 21G) are typically used on patients where larger quantities of blood are needed for testing (i.e. blood cultures). Butterfly Needles. When performing venipuncture, the butterfly needle is typically held by folding the ‘wings’ and then placed into the vein (generally at a shallow angle).When the needle is inserted into the vein, a ‘flash’ can be seen.he tubing on a winged infusion blood collection needle allows for greater flexibility when performing blood draws on ‘difficult’ veins.
