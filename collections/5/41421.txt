B)Fast your dog one meal. For the next meal, feed 1/4 of your dog's normal amount of just new food. The next meal feed 1/2 of the normal amount using just the new food. Stay at this level for 2-4 more meals, then gradually work up to the quantity he normally gets in a meal over another day or two's time. Watch your dog for sloppy stools or for weight gain. If either occur cut back 1/2 cup and observe again. Every food has a different calorie level and you may need to feed more or less of the new food to obtain the same weight management results. Always observe your dog's weight and stool output when changing feeds and adjust meal potions accordingly.
