He was a good conversationalist and a raconteur with a. fine sense of humor. Even in later life he would raise roars of. laughter in his listeners through his keen sense of the comic.

Another conspicuous early trait of his was a spirit of indepenÂ­. dence which enabled him to have his own distinct outlook on. life.
