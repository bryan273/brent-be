0. Two young lovers killed themselves on Monday, allegedly amid fear that they would be broken up. Ariana O'Neal, 21, and Davon Smallwood, 25, jumped in front of an LIRR train Monday, leaving a suicide note behind. O'Neal and Smallwood have a two-year-old daughter but felt pressure on their relationship because O’Neal’s mother did not want the father near their Queens Village home. Smallwood had gotten in trouble with the police, and the woman's mother did not want him around her daughter.
