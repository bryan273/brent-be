Some ofﬁ ces set up the appointment matrix 6 months in advance, whereas others do it for a year in advance. In an appointment book, draw an X through times that the ofﬁ ce is closed. If the ofﬁ ce uses a computer program, set up times when the ofﬁ ce is open and set the appointment interval (10, 15, or 20 minutes).
