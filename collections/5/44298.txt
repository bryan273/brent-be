Best Answer: I have just painted my garage floor with a 2 part epoxy paint. This was applied during a cool day. It took this about 12 hours to cure, not sticky to the touch. We then waited another day before parking the car in the garage. Why are you applying 2 coats, normally epoxy paint is applied so that only one coat is needed.
