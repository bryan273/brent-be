The result of this analysis is that the top 50 crops are sufficient to characterize the world agricultural system in its production of protein, fat, carbohydrates, and kcal for the world population. So, how many kcal does the global food system produce? Just over 10 16 kcal. How many kcal are needed to feed one billions persons? The answer, from my previous post, is 10 15 kcal â€” 10 6 kcal per person per year (2740 kcal per person per day) times 10 9 persons. So at 10 16 kcal, the world agricultural system produces enough kcal to feed 10 billion persons.
