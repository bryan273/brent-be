Posted. I have to agree-the eye teeth were the WORST of all for my DS, he was very sooky and clingy-waking during the night-fussy with food etc. My DD is just starting to get hers-on one side of her gum she has a big purple bruise looking bubble where one is coming through-she has also been extremely clingy. Not fun!
