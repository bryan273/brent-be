Still’s disease is diagnosed purely on the basis of the typical clinical features of the illness. Persistent arthritis (arthritis lasting at least 6 weeks) is required to make a firm diagnosis of Still’s disease. Other diseases (especially infections, cancers, and other types of arthritis) are excluded.
