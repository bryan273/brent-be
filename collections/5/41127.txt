If youâ€™re willing to go off the reservation, you can get a heck of a lot more speed out of one of these pontoon boats, too. In at least one documented case (at the 2011 Lake of the Ozarks Shootout) a 2700 broke an eye-watering 104 MPH, after being juiced up with a 540 cid Dart block and twin Whipple superchargers.
