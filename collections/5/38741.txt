Insulating Your Crawlspace Walls. An under-insulated crawlspace can be a significant source of home energy loss. The best crawl space insulation for your home depends on if your crawlspace is conditioned (heated or cooled by a furnace or air conditioner) or unconditioned. In a vented or unconditioned crawlspace, only the floor is insulated.
