NADH, short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is an important pyridine nucleotide that functions as an oxidative cofactor in eukaryotic cells.NADH plays a key role in the production of energy through redox reactions.ecause of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized form of this important redox reagent is often depicted as NAD+. In cells, most oxidations are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. NAD coenzyme plays a crucial role in this.
