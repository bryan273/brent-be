What Is a Website? A website is a collection of web pages (documents that are accessed through the Internet), such as the one you're looking at now. A web page is what you see on the screen when you type in a web address, click on a link, or put a query in a search engine. A web page can contain any type of information, and can include text, color, graphics, animation and sound. When someone gives you their web address, it generally takes you to their website's home page, which should introduce you to what that site offers in terms of information or other services.
