Two views of the Sun's corona: during an eclipse (top) and in ultraviolet light (bottom). The corona is the outer atmosphere of the Sun. It extends many thousands of kilometers (miles) above the visible surface of the Sun, gradually transforming into the solar wind that flows outward through our solar system. The material in the corona is an extremely hot but very tenuous plasma.
