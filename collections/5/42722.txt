Complementation of the E. coli phr-1 mutation was observed. This was the first time that a complementation approach was used to study eukaryotic DNA repair genes in E. coli. After this, several other eukaryotic genes were identified and characterized by complementation assays in bacteria deficient in DNA repair.omplementation of the E. coli phr-1 mutation was observed.
