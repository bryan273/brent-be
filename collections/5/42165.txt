Equinoxes and solstices are opposite on either side of the equator, and the March equinox is also known as the spring (vernal) equinox in the Northern Hemisphere and as the autumnal (fall) equinox in the Southern Hemisphere. On the equinox, night and day are nearly the same length – 12 hours – all over the world. This is the reason it's called an “equinox”, derived from Latin, meaning equal night.. However, in reality, equinoxes don't have exactly 12 hours of daylight.
