Loopnet Price Increases - 300% to 500%. (self.CommercialRealEstate) submitted 1 year ago by fattailwagging. Now that Loopnet has decided to gouge brokers and has drastically raised their prices (by 300% ~ 500% depending on the level of functionality you are using. In my case the expense is going from $200/month to approximately $1132/month), It is time to consider many of the fine alternatives out there.
