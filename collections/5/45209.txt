Today, 48 percent say a strong women's movement is still needed, while 45 percent say that most of the goals of the women's movement have been met. These views differ from those a decade ago. According to a Time/CNN Poll conducted in 1992, 57 percent of women said a strong women's movement was needed.he number of men who say the women's movement has made their lives better is higher now than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1983, just 28 percent of men said the women's movement improved their lives and 30% said so in 1999. Today, men are less likely than women to say a strong women's movement is still needed.
