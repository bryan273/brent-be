Iron is an essential mineral, with several important roles in the body. For example, it helps to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Good sources of iron include: 1  liver. 2  meat. 3  beans. 4  nuts. 5  dried fruit – such as dried apricots. 6  wholegrains – such as brown rice. 7  fortified breakfast cereals. 8  soybean flour. 9  most dark-green leafy vegetables – such as watercress and curly kale.
