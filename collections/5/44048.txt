Tornadoes, natureâ€™s most violent storms, are spawned from powerful thunderstorms. With whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour, tornadoes can cause fatalities and devastate neighborhoods in seconds. The greatest number of tornadoes in one calendar month is 543, in May 2003. The highest recorded tornadic wind speed is 302 miles per hour, on May 3, 1999 in Bridge Creek, Oklahoma. The largest tornado outbreak in a 24 hour period occurred on April 3-4, 1974.
