Muscle Basics. Muscles are made up of three types of fibers: slow twitch (type I), fast twitch A (type IIa) and fast twitch B (type IIb). During exercise, your muscles are stimulated, and these tiny fibers contract. Slow-twitch muscle fibers contract at a rate of 10 to 30 twitches per second, while fast-twitch muscle fibers contract at a rate of 30 to 70 twitches per second, notes Peak Performance.
