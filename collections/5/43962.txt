Your Scrambling will be displayed on your My Game page with the rest of your statistics. We've also added a stat called Bogey Scramble because we think most mid to high handicapper can work to improve this number in a more realistic manor. It is defined as Scoring a Bogey on a hole where you didn't hit the green in regulation + 1 shot. (basically where you are putting for bogey with your first putt).
