Mission Cemetery. Just a few minutes from the university campus is the Mission Santa Clara Cemetery, at 490 Lincoln St. It was established in 1851 after the Padres recognized they would soon run out of room at the original cemetery on mission grounds. The cemetery features 150 years of Santa Clara Valley history.
