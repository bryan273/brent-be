Back to Questions. How long will the nerve block last? This depends on the type of block performed and the type of numbing medication used. For example, nerve blocks for hand surgery usually last for 6-8 hours, but a nerve block for pain after total knee replacement can last for 12-24 hours. Medication continuously delivered through a tiny plastic tube (nerve catheter) placed next to the nerve can last for 2-3 days. Back to Questions.
