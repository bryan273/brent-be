The FIVE original Beatles were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stu Sutcliffe and Pete Best (there was an assortment of other members under the band's previous naâ€¦me and formation). Stu left the band after he got engaged to German photographer and friend of The Beatles, Astrid Kirchherr. In 1962 they kicked Pete out and replaced him with Ringo Starr. And from that day forward, the four Beatles were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
