If you have a wireless router, connect your smart tv to your wireless network in settings. Once your connected to your router choose input list and you will see the name of your computer listed.Choose your computer then search through your computer folders to find file you want to play. have a smart TV and I used my xbox HDMI cord. I plug my xbox HDMI into my computer (just take the time to fine the right plug to plug it into) it does not matter which end of the HDMI cord you use because both ends can be used either on the computer or laptop.
