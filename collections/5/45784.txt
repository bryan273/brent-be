I'm curious to see how people will answer this question. Update: One reason I ask this because of how annoyingly PC people are in this section. I can't even say I attracted to Latinas without someone saying Latinos aren't a race. Even though they know damn well what I'm talking about. I've heard people say Latino's including these groups are just black and white people mixed, which I have problems with. The smarter users are saying Mongoloid's, but so many groups are thrown in this category, even though many anthropologists consider groups in this category to be distinct races.
