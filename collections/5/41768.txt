A biography is written by another person; the writer depicts the events in the subject’s life. An autobiography is a biography that is written by the subject himself. It is just like a biography and incorporates all the elements of a biography. The only way it differs from a biography is that instead of being written by a third person author, it is written by the subject themselves. The ‘auto’ in autobiography means ‘self’. Hence, an autobiography is a self-biography. The subject may or may not have used the help of a ghost writer to write the autobiography. A ghost writer helps a person write a work but is often unaccredited for it.
