When active (live) yeast has both sugar and oxygen available to it, it 'breathes' by a process called aerobic respiration. In this reaction, yeast cells use glucose (sugar) and oxygen (from the air) to produce energy. They also produce water and carbon dioxide (a gas). This is the same chemical process used by humans. If no oxygen is available, yeast will switch over to a process called anaerobic respiration - in this process, glucose (sugar) is fermented to produce energy, carbon dioxide, and ethanol.
