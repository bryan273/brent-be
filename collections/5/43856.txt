So, for example for the Sun λmax = 5.1 nm Therefore T=(2.898*10^-3m°K)/(5.1*10^-9m) T=568,000 °C So as an object increases in temperature, its colour will slowly change, starting at red and progressing into blue and beyond. A stars temperature is generally worked out by the average temperature of the photosphere.
