A predatory interaction occurs when one organism preys on another organism as a food source. Emperor Penguins have predators that use the penguin as a source of food. These predators include gulls, petrels, skuas, leopard seals, sea lions, and killer whales.Skuas are closely related to gulls, and gulls like to prey on chicks and steal eggs.ome areas of Antarctica are seeing an increase in temperatures, which is causing the ice to melt. This, in turn, reduces the amount of krill available as the main food source for the Emperor Penguin. There is a large amount of greenhouse gas in the air, which is causing a hole to form in the ozone layer.
