The best-of-five League Championship Series switched to a best-of-seven series in 1985 to increase revenue and match the length of the World Series. The 1981 season was a separate case. A mid-season player's strike split the season in half and upset fans-some of which still remain discontent with our national pastime. Major League Baseball hoped to recoup some of the lost revenue and win back the disinterested fans so an extra level of playoff games were played. Three divisions were created in 1993 to make room for the expansion teams.
