The 2.0 L (1,993 cc) was used in many Ford vehicles from the early 1970s. Due to its robustness and high tuning potential it's often used as an aftermarket engine upgrade or base for building race&rally engines â€” not exclusively in Ford cars.lthough Ford marked its standard 2.0 L engine as a HC it actually uses engine codes meant for the 'increased performance variant' engines (coding starting with 'NE').
