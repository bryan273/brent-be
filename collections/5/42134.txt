Generally, you can grant authority to make any or all of your financial decisions (e.g., those related to banking, accounts, insurance, taxes, real estate, etc.). You can choose which powers you want to grant, with one significant exception. You cannot authorize your attorney-in-fact to make changes to your last will.
