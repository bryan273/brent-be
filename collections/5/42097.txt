Threadworm infestation is caused by the roundworm Enterobius vermicularis and is the most common parasitic worm infestation affecting humans in the UK. Usually, infestation occurs by ingesting worm eggs in contaminated food, on fingers, or in house dust. If they are swallowed, the eggs develop into adult threadworms in the intestine. At night, female threadworms crawl out of the anus to lay eggs around the anal region, causing intense itching. Threadworm infestation mainly affects children. Threadworms infest the intestine and emerge from the anus at night to lay eggs in the anal region, causing itching.
