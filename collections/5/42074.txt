Lymph nodes exist in various parts of your body, including the armpits (axilla), the groin, and the neck. Once lymph fluid reaches the lymph nodes, it is filtered and treated. The lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system and foreign cells that arrive in the lymph nodes are attacked by immune system cells.
