Add flavor and substance to your pork chops without the effort of making an entire side item. A hearty sauce, chutney or relish is an excellent accompaniment. Try a white- and black-bean salsa; toss beans, chopped tomatoes, and cilantro with a white-wine vinegar and simmer until warm, then serve over the chops.
