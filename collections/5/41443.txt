I found myself verifying the information to the same degree whether I use Loopnet or Costar; Costar is not much of a time-saver but it sure costs a lot more. Given the cost of Costar, I think it is cost-prohibitive (unless, as nstanbru states, one is a busy commercial firm; I'm not... yet! ). And, in my markets, Costar is broken down by counties. In the immediate area there are 5-counties; the annual subscription is through the roof that coverage.
