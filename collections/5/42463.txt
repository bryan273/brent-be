The Greek Dark Age chronology does not have any single fixed point, which means that, since literacy was lost, we do not have any historical event that could be linked to world chronology. Some scholars have proposed a date between c. 1200 BCE and c. 800 BCE for the Greek Dark Age.Others believe that it begins in c. 1100 BCE and ends in 776 BCE, the date of the first Olympian Games (according to Hippias of Elis).A date between c. 1000 and 750 BCE has also been favoured.ome scholars have proposed a date between c. 1200 BCE and c. 800 BCE for the Greek Dark Age.
