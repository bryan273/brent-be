This is why only the mother's mtDNA carries on to subsequent generations. Since mtDNA is passed on only through maternal lines, forensic scientists can use it to assist with the identification of someone who died long ago by matching that person's mtDNA to any ancestor or descendant on that line. This wouldn't be possible, however, if mtDNA wasn't as long lived as it is.
