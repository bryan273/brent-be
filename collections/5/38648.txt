The establishment of the English Bill of Rights was precipitated by repeated abuses of power by King James II during his reign from 1685 to 1689. Among these abuses, he suspended acts of Parliament, collected taxes not authorized by law, and undermined the independence of the judiciary and the universities.he second section of the English Bill of Rights sets forth a declaration of thirteen ancient rights and liberties which the document is intended to protect. These largely mirror the enumerations of error from the preceding section, and it is these rights that we will analyze in more detail.
