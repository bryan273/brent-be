Just you and I building our dreams together. ps Eddie Rabbit (Driving my life away) and Crystal Gayle (talking in your sleep) two of the most connsumate country artists and beautiful voices in the business. Kenny Rogers did MORE duets than anyone I can think of. I can't remember a duet he did with Crystal Gayle.
