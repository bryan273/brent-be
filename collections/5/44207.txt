How much does Disney's fireworks show Wishes cost per night? Answer Wiki. I used to work at Disney Consumer Products and we once were given a tour of Imagineering, which was right next door, and they stated that each show at each park costs â‰ˆ$50,000. Disney is the largest consumer of fireworks in the entire world. 5 parks multiplied by 365 nights a year comes out to a whopping $91,250,000 spent per year on firework supply alone. This gives some more perspective to their seemingly outrageously expensive ticket prices.
