A medieval castle once ruled by Charlemagne, the “King of the Franks,” is for sale in Italy, dungeon included. Located (exactly) on the border of Tuscany and Umbria, the castle dates to 802, says Marie-Josèphe Mucchielli, general director of Kalliste Property Management and Real Estate, the listing agent. The castle’s “guests and conquerors” include Federico Barbarossa, Federico II, Pius VII and Fernando de’ Medici, she says.
