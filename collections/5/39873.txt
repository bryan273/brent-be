Children need you for at least 18 years. Therefore, assuming you'll live to 80 the very latest anyone should have a baby would be 60 and that is REALLY stretching things. Even if you do live to a 'ripe old age' health deteriorates after a time and how can a woman look after a baby when their own health is suffering. My own mum is 65 and on the two occasions she has looked after my 16 month old for a few hours she has been exhausted.
