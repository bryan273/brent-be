Jon's improv credentials run a bit longer than you'd think-he appeared in all three Whose Line attempted followups (Drew Careys Green Screen Show, Drew Careys Improvaganza and Trust Us with Your Life), thanks primarily to his work with Wayne Brady over on the set of Lets Make A Deal. Running Gag: Many of the players always joke about the fact Drew is the producer of both Whose Line and his own Drew Carey Show, ranging from the fact he's astoundingly wealthy and that he has two shows in the first place.
