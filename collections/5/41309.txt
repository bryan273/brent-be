In his fifth game, Sayers scored four touchdowns in a 45-37 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. He did even better two months later in the Bears' 61-20 rout of the 49ers, with his six touchdowns equaling the record set by the Chicago Cardinals' Ernie Nevers in 1929 and tied by the Cleveland Browns' Dub Jones in 1951.
