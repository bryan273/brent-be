1 Convert grams to moles. 2  Empirical formula is a comparison of the number of moles of a compound so you need your values in moles. 3  Using the oxygen example again, there are 16.0 grams per mole of oxygen so 40 grams of oxygen would be 40/16 = 2.5 moles of oxygen.hen you have the molar mass you can find the ratio of the actual mass of the compound to the empirical mass. If the ratio is one (as with water, H 2 O), then the empirical formula and molecular formula are the same.
