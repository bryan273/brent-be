Thus, rituals are not the end expression or result of Creation; rituals are the physical acts, combined with Intent, that precede Ceremonial magic.

One who performs rituals without ceremony is simply conducting some interesting acts of configuration and placement. These configurations do not create; nor do they manifest.
