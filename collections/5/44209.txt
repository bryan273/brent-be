The tradition of fireworks shows date back to 1956, when Disneyland began nightly shows during summer months. To better sync explosions with musical tracks, hand-lit fireworks were replaced by electronically controlled systems in 1960. In 2000, Disney introduced air launch fireworks, which significantly reduce air and noise pollution. As of 2014, Disney hosts nightly firework displays, and specialty shows for holidays, such as Halloween, New Year's Eve and Independence Day.
