Posted August 22, 2013 6:56pm. Your question was whether the executor of an estate may grant a power of attorney to another person to sell a home owned by the estate. It will be easier for me to answer this question if I make a minor correction in the terminology. The executor is not granting a power of appointment but rather delegating some of his/her duties to another.
