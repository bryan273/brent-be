1 My uncle (or xyz relative) did a PhD and I also want to do it, I want to make my parents proud, and/or no one in our family has a PhD and I want to be the first one etc. 2  Everyone is different and possesses different strengths and weaknesses. Firstly, there is no evidence that PhDs earn more (in fact, many surveys report the other way around). 2  Secondly, a PhD degree helps you in securing only research related jobs (e.g., a faculty position, a research position in a research company).
