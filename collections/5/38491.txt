A dishcloth is a type of kitchen linen designed to help people who hand wash dishes. Most dishcloths are similar in size and shape to a regular washcloth. In addition to cleaning dishes, these kinds of cloths can be used to clean tabletops, counters, and other kitchen surfaces. While the most common function of a dishcloth is to wash dishes, many people display decorative dishcloths in their kitchens.
