In theory, you can measure the volume of anything in kiloliters or milliliters. But depending on how big the volume is, one unit might be much more practical than the other. Soft drinks are measured in mL, as shown at the bottom of a can. The capacity of a swimming pool might be measured in kL. Technically you can represent any volume in mL or kL. Some things which would normally use mL would be drinking bottles (bottle of soda or water) or a bottle of liquor (750 mL).
