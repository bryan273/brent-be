One of the more frustrating things about growing tomatoes is watching a tomato ripen on the vine, slowly growing and changing from green, to pink, to red.... and then looking one morning and seeing that that tomato you've been waiting for has split. Provide your plants with a good two to three inch layer of organic mulch such as straw, pine needles, or shredded bark. 2  This will maintain more regular soil moisture levels, and you'll deal with less splitting. 3  Look for Resistant Varieties. 4  In general, the thicker the skin, the less prone a tomato is to splitting.
