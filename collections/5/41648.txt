Atmospheric scientists have created definite temperature and humidity criteria to classify each air mass. We'll classify them based on their general conditions, e.g. warm and wet, cold and dry. The latitude of the source region fundamentally determines the temperature of an air mass. Arctic air masses form between 60o and 90o north latitude.
