Chenopodium quinoa is a member of the goosefoot family. Although you often hear it referred to as a grain, this is actually incorrect. Quinoa, is actually not a whole grain, but a seed. Although it is used much like a grain, a more accurate term is a pseudo grain or pseudo cereal. Quinoa is closely related to leafy green plans like beets, chard and spinach. The leaves of quinoa can be eaten just like spinach. Since the seeds can be prepared just like many whole grains, most recipes treat it much like any other grain. The quinoa plant grows six feet high and has 3 to 9 foot magenta stalks.
