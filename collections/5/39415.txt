In addition to changing weather, be prepared for steep hills, windy roads, wildlife, and rocks in the roadway. If your vehicle experiences difficulties traveling up steep roadways, pull off the road at the first place you may do so safely, or stay in the right lane to allow other vehicles to pass. Pay special attention to speed limit and warning signs, such as those warning of curves, steep hills, or other hazards.
