As a benchmark, one inch of solid wood has an R-value of 1. In comparison, an inch of blown fiberglass insulation has an R-value of 3.1 - 3.4 and an inch of blown cellulose in an attic has an R-value of 3.2 - 3.7. Along with knowing the R-value of a particular insulation, it is also important to calculate the R-value of a total system.
