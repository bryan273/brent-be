This is by far one of the most amazing and enjoyable events that I have ever been to. To sum it all up, I would describe the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta as a multi-faceted experience that is beautiful, surreal, and interesting. It's a photographer's dream! My favorite part was the Mass Ascension.
