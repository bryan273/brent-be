The fibers of the muscles, within the belly of the muscles, do not have the capability of popping or making sounds. Now, the tendons of the muscles can snap or pop over other tendons or bony prominences. It is very common to have snapping of the tendons around the hip and shoulder regions. But, other than that, most of the sounds come from the joints. That sound is called benign crepitus.
