Gente de Zona and Marc Anthony are ready to spice up your summer with their new single. The single was introduced at the Billboard Latin Music Awards last April, where Gente De Zona received 6 awards for their most recent musical collaborations. Directed by Alejandro PÃ©rez, La Gozadera was filmed on location in Cuba and Dominican Republic. Gente de Zona shot their scenes in Havana and then joined Anthony in Dominican Republic to film the remaining scenes. Choreographed by Roclan, the montage involved a body of over 100 dancers.
