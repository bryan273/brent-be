Pulmonary specialists work closely with other doctors and nurses as a part of a medical care team. Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood from the heart, to the lungs, and back to the heart again. A pulmonary specialist treats patients who have problems with their lungs or respiratory systems. Becoming a pulmonary specialist requires a major commitment to education.
