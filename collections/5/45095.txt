As the Pacific Plate subducts, some pieces of the crust scrape off onto the North American Plate. However, most of the dense sinking plate gets pulled into the mantle where it melts into the surrounding material. This helps to create volcanoes inland from the subduction zone that marks the border between the two plates. In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the North American Plate borders the Eurasian Plate. The two plates move apart from each other at this divergent boundary. As they pull apart, the mantle material beneath rises to create new crust on the ocean floor. The continually rising mantle material created the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an underwater chain of mountains.
