REVISION: 0. AUTHOR: John Merrell. Introduction. In some short circuit studies, the X/R ratio is ignored when comparing the short circuit rating of the. equipment to the available fault current at the equipment. What is not always realized is that when low-. voltage gear is tested, it is tested at a certain X/R ratio. The X/R ratio is important because it determines. the peak asymmetrical fault current. The asymmetrical fault current can be much larger than the. symmetrical fault current.
