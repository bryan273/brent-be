At what time do the glow worms appear on Neopets? They don't appear at specfic times, they appear randomly in (I think) periods of 10 minutes. So if you look at one Moltara area and don't see any, refreshing straight away won â€¦ 't ever help, you need to check again 10 minutes later (or so) and see if any have appeared.
