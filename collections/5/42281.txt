Butterfly tattoos are placed on various spots on the body, the most popular being the upper arm, back, foot, shoulder, and lower back, and come in a variety of colours including pink, blue, and black. In the Asian culture, seeing a black butterfly signifies the imminent or recent death of a loved one.
