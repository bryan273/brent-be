Since most manufacturing processes involve more than one step, a similar calculation is made for each step to arrive at a unit cost average for the entire production system. By contrast, the second major costing method, job-order costing, is concerned with tracking all the costs on an individual product basis. This is useful in settings where each unit of production is customized or where there are very few units produced, such as in building pianos, ships, or airplanes.
