The battle of France, of which Dunkirk was the final chapter, was a disaster, although Eduardo J Belgrano’s description of ‘unmitigated’ is incorrect. The evacuation, Operation DYNAMO, was conceived, planned and began operation in six days. Nine days later over 338,000 men were landed in Britain, most of which lived to fight another day.
