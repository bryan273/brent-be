1 During shiva, a mourner is striving to ignore his/her own physicality and vanity in order to concentrate on the reality of being a soul.  A mirror represents social acceptance through the enhancement of one's appearance. Jewish mourning is supposed to be lonely, silent; dwelling on one's personal loss.
