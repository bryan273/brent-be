In the deep south, from Florida to central Texas, St Augustine grass is the turf of choice. It is a tropical grass being found in several countries and islands from Africa to Australia. The southern states in the warm/humid Climate Zone in the U.S. forms the range for this grass.he plugs should be place from 6 to 12 inches apart. St Augustine grass can be plugged at 24 inches apart, but will take longer to fill in. If using stolons, the stolons must be covered over with a thin layer of dirt except for the grass blades. This encourages rooting.
