A Brachioplasty, otherwise known as an Arm Lift, is a surgical procedure to reshape the soft, flabby, inner portion of the upper arm. From the axilla (underarm area) to the elbow, a Brachioplasty allows a doctor to remove the excess skin and fatty tissue that can form as we age or may occur after a large weight loss.
