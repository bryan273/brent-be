An exothermic thermite reaction using iron(III) oxide. The sparks flying outwards are globules of molten irons trailing smoke in their wake. An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction that releases energy by light or heat. It is the opposite of an endothermic reaction. Expressed in a chemical equation: reactants â†’ products + energy.
