Ethics Awareness Month. The CPCU Society is proud of the efforts of our chapters to keep ethical practices alive and utilized throughout the year. Ethics Awareness Month is a time to celebrate our high ethical standards and share with our members different ideas and methods to convey this message. Once again, we will use our website as a means of providing chapters with topics, concepts and approaches to Ethics Awareness Month. New activities, articles and polls will be posted. During the past few years, chapters have been able to use this information, to generate visibility of the CPCU designation. Several chapters have designed their own events and approaches to Ethics Awareness Month.
