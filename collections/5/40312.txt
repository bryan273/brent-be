There are approximately 325 pairs of muscles in the human body, as each muscle has a corresponding opposite muscle. Swimming, a cardiovascular activity, uses muscles throughout the upper body, core and lower body to successfully carry out the sequence of moves involved with swimming. Swimming is a non-impact cardio activity, so you can work your muscles without putting impact on your joints.
