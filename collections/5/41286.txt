Several things, but among the most important things you will see is that through 2014, the S&P 500 had an average annual return of 10.12% and the 20 year average is 9.85%. That’s great. But I don’t think it’s realistic and useful for long-term planning projections. In 2011, the 20 year average, returned 7.81% per year.
