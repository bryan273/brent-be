We will calculate the letter height, L, at distance, D, for both 20 feet and 6 meters. To simplify the numbers we can do the calculation at 1 degree then divide by 12 to get 5 min. The Rest of the Letters. A 20/40 letter is twice the height of a 20/20 letter and a 20/200 letter is 10 times that. Calculate Retinal Image Size. Looking the other direction the size of the 20/20 letter on the retina can be found by the above method or by similar triangles.
