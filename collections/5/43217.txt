CT (computerized tomography) uses a sophisticated X ray machine combined with a computer to create a detailed picture of the bodys tissues and structure. Usually a special dye called a contrast material will be injected prior to the scan. This makes it easier to see abnormal tissue due to specific absorption rates.
