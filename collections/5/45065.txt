Whether the cell was eukaryotic or prokaryotic, these basic events must occur. Cytokinesis is the process where one cell splits off from its sister cell. It usually occurs after cell division. The Cell Cycle is the sequence of growth, DNA replication, growth and cell division that all cells go through.Beginning after cytokinesis, the daughter cells are quite small and low on ATP.They acquire ATP and increase in size during the G1 phase of Interphase.itosis is the process of forming (generally) identical daughter cells by replicating and dividing the original chromosomes, in effect making a cellular xerox. Commonly the two processes of cell division are confused.
