The art and practice of indoor plumbing took nearly a century to develop, starting in. about the 1840s. In 1940 nearly half of houses lacked hot piped water, a bathtub or shower, or a. flush toilet. Over a third of houses didn’t have a flush toilet. As late as 1960, over 25% of the. houses in 16 states didn’t have complete plumbing facilities. Half of all households heated with coal in 1940, and another quarter heated with wood. By 2000 the fraction of houses that heated with wood or coal was below 5%.
