Format: Audio CD. I bought this a very long time ago, mainly for the song WAR, I just loved that song and believed in it's words.. Now it is making a big comeback in new movies I've seen and on the radio.In the late 60's it was a song about the Vietnam War. It is a one hit wonder to me, but even on tv the actors know every word, and the main line of the song.
