Some standards may be waiverable on a case by case basis. That means if you are ineligible at first glance, you still may be able to serve. A recruiter would be able to help you with the specifics in your case. If you want to read more about waivers, you can stop by Army Regulation 601-210 (check Chapter 4). If you have served in the military before, check your DD 214 to see what your re-enlistment code is. You will find an explanation of these codes here.
