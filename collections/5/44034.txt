The battle of France, of which Dunkirk was the final chapter, was a disaster, although  Eduardo J Belgrano’s description of ‘unmitigated’ is incorrect. The evacuation, Operation DYNAMO, was conceived, planned and began operation in six days. Nine days later over 338,000 men were landed in Britain, most of which lived to fight another day. The little boats, many manned by civilians and not normally suited to cross channel operations, were heroically taken to the beaches and jetties carrying the defeated soldiers to larger ships or directly home.
