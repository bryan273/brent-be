Hot And Burning Leg Skin Is Often Caused By Vein Problems. A hot and “burning” sensation on the leg’s skin is often the sign of the common but serious vein problem “Venous Reflux.” Hot and burning leg skin is often uncomfortable, painful, and can negatively impact an individual’s quality of life. To determine if your hot and burning leg skin sensation is from vein problems, the first step is to schedule a Hot And Burning Leg Skin Consultation with the vein specialists at Mountcastle Vein Centers.
