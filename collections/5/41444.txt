BorderRunner New Member. CoStar. Paul, I use CoStar Comps Express occasionally. $40.00 for a 24 Hr search and then $40.00 per comp. The $40.00 search fee is credited towards a comp. Most sales are confirmed. Many donâ€™t have the financial information, lease rates, NOI, etc., but you will know that before you purchase.
