1 Venipuncture with a Butterfly Needle: This is a specialized procedure that utilizes a flexible, butterfly needle adaptor. 2  A butterfly needle has two plastic wings (one on either side of the needle) and is connected to a flexible tube, which is then attached to a reservoir for the blood. Making use of a butterfly needle, this therapy provides a slow removal of up to one pint of blood. 2  Though the blood removed is not used for blood transfusions, the procedure and concerns are the same as with routine blood donation.
