Titan Spine’s nanoLOCKTM surface technology, which was the first FDA-cleared nanotechnology for interbody fusion devices, has been given access to use this code. The “Interbody Fusion Device, Nanotextured Surface” code was approved as an XRG code by CMS and will be able to be used starting October 1, 2016. This code was approved based on information presented by Titan Spine on its nanoLOCKTM surface that demonstrated it as a unique and differentiated technology.
