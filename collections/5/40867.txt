The lekythos (Fig. 305) was an oil-jar of an elongated shape, neck in proportion, cup-like orifice, and one handle. For other shapes, such as the hydria, and lekythos, the old method was for a time preferred. The pyxis was used by women at their toilet, and the lekythos, alabastron and askos for oil and unguents.
