Curing New Concrete. New concrete is very alkaline with a pH of 12 to 14. It also has high moisture content. These characteristics will interfere with paint adhesion, leading to bubbling and peeling. Allowing the new concrete to cure for at least 30 days can reduce the alkalinity and moisture content to levels low enough for the concrete to take paint. But it can take as long as 90 days before new concrete has cured enough for painting, depending on climate and weather.
