• The mass of the empty flask is equal to the difference between the mass (flask + foil + air) and the calculated mass of dry air. • The mass of carbon dioxide in the flask is determined by subtracting the mass of the empty. flask from the largest value of mass (flask + foil + CO. 2). • The molecular weight of carbon dioxide is determined using Equation (4) in the Procedure. handout.
