Location: Part of the Limbic system, in each temporal lobe. Function: Responsible for processing of long term memory and emotional responses. The hippocampus has a unique shape, similar to that of a horseshoe. It not only assists with the storage of long term memories, but is also responsible for the memory of the location of objects or people. We would not even be able to remember where our house is without the work of the hippocampus.
