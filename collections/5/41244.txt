Spagnum is probably not the best stuff to plant your plants, unless you are using meat eating plants for two reasons: 1.your plants will sink into the moss and might kill your hermit crabs. 2.it is hard to landscape because of the last reason. Also, your hermit crabs, because they are herbavoris, will eat your plants.
