When measuring a small liquid volume, such as a dosage of cough medicine, the best unit to use is milliliters or ounces. A slightly larger volume, like the amount of flour or sugar needed to make cookie dough, would be measured using cups. A liquid volume of this size, like heavy cream, would be measured using pints, milliliters, or liters. The volume of a bigger amount, like a bottle of apple juice or soda pop, can be measured using liters and quarts. A really big liquid volume, like an aquarium or swimming pool, would be measured in gallons or liters.
