It's essentially the same as a 1.6L Pinto engine. I got all my parts from a Ford Industrial engine dealer.I did replace the distributor, using a Pinto part that I got thru Napa. It fit and works fine. rebuilt that same engine in my 722 last year. It's essentially the same as a 1.6L Pinto engine. I got all my parts from a Ford Industrial engine dealer.
