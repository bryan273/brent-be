First it has to be said that thatching is incredibly labour intensive and labour rates are not at the bottom end of earnings – and rightly so. Often customers have said to me “I never realised there was so much work involved”.. http://www.periodproperty.co.uk £600 – £800 per square. These prices are very out of date and I suspect the rates quoted in 2, 4 & 5 have been found from other sites and given without any research. The quote below shows that typical prices from 2003 were in excess of most of the prices quoted above!
