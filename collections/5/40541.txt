The term New Age describes a broad movement of late twentieth century and contemporary Western culture, characterized by an individual eclectic approach to spiritual exploration. Collectively, New Age has some attributes of an emergent religion, but is currently a loose network of spiritual teachers, healers, and seekers. The movement is most visible where its ideas are tradedâ€”for example in specialist bookshops, music stores, and New Age fairs.
