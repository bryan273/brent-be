By far, most cases of benign tracheal stenosis are the result of tracheal trauma, the majority of which are secondary to endotracheal intubation. Prior to the advent of compliant, high-volume, low-pressure cuffs, the incidence of tracheal stenosis following intubation was as high as 20%. By 1981, some studies were reporting incidences as low as 1%.
