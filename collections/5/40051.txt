Estrogen and progesterone are the female sex hormones. Estrogen is primarily a female sex hormone, but both men and women make estrogen. Women, of course, have higher levels of it. Femininity is the essence of estrogen. Estrogen enlarges breasts and widens the pelvis, and it provides that curvy, sexy appearance.
