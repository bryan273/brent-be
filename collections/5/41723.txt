Virginia became part of the Nurse Licensure Compact in January 2005. Therefore, as of February 4, 2005, the Virginia Board of Nursing will no longer be verifying Virginia R.N. or L.P.N. licenses to other states. Verification of Virginia licenses will be processed through the National Council of State Boards of Nursing through the NURSYS system.
