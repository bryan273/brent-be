The number of bypasses required depends on the location and severity of blockages in your heart. Most coronary bypass surgeries are done through a long incision in the chest while blood flow is diverted through a heart-lung machine (called on-pump coronary bypass surgery). The surgeon cuts down the center of the chest, along the breastbone. The surgeon then spreads open the rib cage to expose the heart.
