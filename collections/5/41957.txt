The Edible Schoolyard Project began in 1994 when the seed of an idea was planted by world-renowned chef and food activist Alice Waters. Her dream: to provide students with the opportunity to grow the food and then participate in the preparation of their own school lunches.We're in the middle of a health epidemic, says Waters. If we could somehow bring in a curriculum around school lunch, we could begin to change the way kids think about eating.. want them to leave this program with enough confidence that they can improvise in the kitchen, she adds -- the true test, perhaps, of a confident, capable cook. Through their work in the Edible Schoolyard and kitchen students grow in their understanding of themselves -- and their connection to the environment.
