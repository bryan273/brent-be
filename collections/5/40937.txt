Stretching – Gentle movements by going through your full range of motion can be very helpful. Do not push stretches too hard without discussing first with a Physical Therapist, Massage Therapist, or Athletic Trainer. You can over-stretch, and just because a muscle is hurting, doesn’t mean it needs to be elongated.
