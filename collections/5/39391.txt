Biochemical differentiation between Staphylococci and Streptococci with CATALASE test: The main criterion for differentiation between Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera is the catalase test. Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas Streptococci are Catalase negative. Catalase is an enzyme used by bacteria to induce the reaction of reduction of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
