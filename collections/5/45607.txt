Stop waiting for water to heat up and watching money go down the drain. The NEW Recirculation Pump Kit from Rheem provides immediate hot water using the Tankless water heater controls. A timer setting can be activated to run every so often (for example, every 30 minutes) to keep hot water flowing through the homes pipes and ready when needed.
