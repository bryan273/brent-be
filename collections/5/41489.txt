I don't use a thermometer. For science, the Kelvin scale is superior. Any equation that has a T fir temperature in it, you can bet that it's on an absolute scale, where 0 is absolute zero. For daily life, think about this: at 0 Fahrenheit, you are really frickin' cold, but can live with appropriate gear. At 100 F, you are really frickin' hot, but can function somewhat.
