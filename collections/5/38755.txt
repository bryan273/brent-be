APA References (6th edition) Helpful Hints. • Only the major publication for each entry is italicized: (Article title, Journal Title). • All reference pages are double-spaced throughout. (exception: dissertation reference pages). • Capitalization rules vary, depending upon type of reference (e.g., book vs. journal). • Each reference entry is indented after the first line (hanging indent).
