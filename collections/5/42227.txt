Bobcats are strict carnivores and prey upon a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and birds. Supremely resourceful and adaptable, the bobcat thrives in habitats ranging from the dense chaparral of southern California, to the forests of British Columbia, to the citrus groves of central Florida, and to the swampy forests of the Gulf Coast.
