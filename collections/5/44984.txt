The Ming walls were built mostly with standard sized bricks, huge granite blocks, and locally quarried rocks. These impressive Ming sections of the Great Wall stand about 25 feet (7.5 m) high, and anywhere from 15-30 feet (4.5-9m) wide at the base. For the first time, kiln-fired bricks were used in the construction.
