The bushes can grow up to 12 feet tall, but most peak at about 6 feet. In the spring, clusters of beautiful white blossoms pop up all over the bushes and are pollinated by bees. Each blossom eventually becomes one blueberry â€“ first hard and green, then reddish-purple, and finally blue, sweet and ready to eat!or the fresh market, blueberries are mainly picked by hand, but some are gathered with large harvesting machines that move slowly along the rows of blueberry plants and gently shake each one so ripe berries fall into a catching frame. (Most machine-harvested berries are washed, frozen and sold in stores year-round.).
