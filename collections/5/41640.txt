Simplifying sending e-mail “As” another mailbox. Microsoft Outlook support has often been asked if it is possible to automatically have the “From” field populated with a shared mailbox owner’s email address. This question generally comes from a user who is either a Delegate for that mailbox owner (with added permissions) or a user who has “Send As” permissions. Typically, you would access the Inbox of the shared folder and then click on the New E-mail button in the ribbon. When the New Message window comes up, the “From” field is populated with the default account owner’s address.
