Best Answer: it aint B - because consider we can burn glucose and create energy so the reverse of B is exothermic. An exothermic process releases thermal energy as it proceeds (such as burning a fuel). The process of combusting sugars releases energy. So the reverse process of forming glucose does not. It is endothermic. Evaporation is also a cooling process. So the reverse (condensation) releases energy and is exothermic.
