The bacteria Escherichia coli has been widely employed in studies of eukaryotic DNA repair genes. Several eukaryotic genes have been cloned by functional complementation of mutant lineages of E. coli.We examined the similarities and differences among bacterial and eukaryotic DNA repair systems.omplementation of the E. coli phr-1 mutation was observed. This was the first time that a complementation approach was used to study eukaryotic DNA repair genes in E. coli. After this, several other eukaryotic genes were identified and characterized by complementation assays in bacteria deficient in DNA repair.
