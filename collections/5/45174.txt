Best Answer: Any beef should be maintained at an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees for at least five minutes for safety. I, myself, prefer to heat it to 170 degrees, as this accounts for equipment errors or elevation differences. One other way to tell is when the meat just begins to pull away from the sides of the dish. Source(s):
