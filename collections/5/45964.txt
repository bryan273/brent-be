The golden buzzer is a concept that was introduced in Season 9 of America's Got Talent. Each judge may only press it once during the season. In Season 9, the Golden Buzzer sent the act to the next round regardless of the other judges' votes; its main purpose was to break ties. In Season 10, the Golden Buzzer was upgraded to send an act straight to the live shows.
