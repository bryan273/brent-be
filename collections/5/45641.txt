As this enzyme cuts up the proteins, the DNA will separate from the proteins and unwind. Each DNA molecule consists of two strands of nucleotides twisted together in a long spiral called a double helix. DNA is made up of four different types of nucleotide: A, C, G and T. Each DNA molecule contains multiple genes. Each gene is a segment of DNA with a sequence of nucleotides that provides the instructions for making a protein. A cell needs many different types of proteins to function.
