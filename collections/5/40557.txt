Therapeutic interventions for troubled families often sound and appear unusual or abstract, such as “Structural Family Therapy” or “SFT,” for example. This isn’t a name that instantly rolls off your tongue, or a therapy you hear used frequently in the press or in movies, such as the more ubiquitous techniques of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. But SFT is similar to other types of therapies categorized under the psychological framework of family systems therapy. These types of therapies view the family unit as a system that lives and operates within larger systems, such as a culture, the community, and organizations.
