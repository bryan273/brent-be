UPP, or Unilateral Pricing Policy, is a way for TV manufacturers to force retailers to keep manufacturer-specified pricing. As in no crazy discounts to move stock, no doorbuster deals, and no (let's be honest here) price competition.The price is the price is the price.hough the beauty of this deal is that with UPP, TV companies aren't allowed to pressure specific pricing, only imply a threat if the pricing isn't followed. An explicit threat would be price fixing, an implicit threat is UPP. Hazzah! Except, it's not quite that simple.
