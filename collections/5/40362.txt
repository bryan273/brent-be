DRESS CODE: BLACK TIE OPTIONAL. One of the murkier dress codes, men are given the option of either wearing a tuxedo or a dark suit and a tie. Because men are given the option of dressing in a more casual manner, the dress code is more open for women too, who can wear anything from a long dress to a cocktail number. Think of it like this: You aren’t expected to look as if you’re en route the Oscars, but you should still make an effort with formal attire.
