Unversal City, Calif. — Danielle Bradbery has The Voice — and the microphone-holding trophy to match. The 16-year-old country singer said she was overwhelmed with emotion when she was crowned the winner of the NBC singing competition Tuesday. I mean confetti and fireworks in the background and being handed this really heavy trophy. It was all so incredibly overwhelming, Bradbery said of her crowning moment.
