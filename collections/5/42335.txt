The Four-Generation Family. Many grandparents are torn between wanting to spend time with grandchildren and needing to care for their own parents. On December 12, 2007, James and Nancy Wilcox of Lyman, Maine, welcomed their first grandchild, Connor, into the world. A month later, they welcomed James's parents into their home. I left my job to take care of them, Nancy says. Unusual just a few decades ago, the four-generation family has become a 21st-century social phenomenon. Today many grandparents are at the center of their families, not always an enviable position.
