Classification: There are a number of different classification systems for streptococci and. enterococci. The most commonly used, because of its simplicity, is the hemolytic pattern of the. different species -- alpha (green hemolysis), beta (clear lysis) and gamma (no hemolysis) on. blood agar plates.
