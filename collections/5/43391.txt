I read the book as soon as it was released and was lucky enough to attend the film’s premiere in Los Angeles where Richard Rowley, the director and cinematographer, spoke about the film and had a Q&A. I’ve been trying to convince everyone who will listen and is at all politically inclined to see this film.
