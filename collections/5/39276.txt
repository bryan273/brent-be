To get a jump start on the growing season, you can sow Malva Zebrina seeds indoors or in the greenhouse 6 - 8 weeks before the last frost date. Use starter trays and quality starter mix and sow the Hollyhock seeds on the surface, pressing them into the soil to make good contact. Keep them consistently moist.
