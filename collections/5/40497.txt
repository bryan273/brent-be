The Disney series takes place three months after the Nickelodeon series ends. Doug is turning twelve and wants to get a haircut before his birthday party. As he delivers his invitations, he notices Connie's weight loss, Roger getting rich, the Honker Burger closed, the Beets breaking up, and Patti being homeschooled part-time. Skeeter also notices Doug's voice changing.
