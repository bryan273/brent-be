Ethics Awareness Month The CPCU Society is proud of the efforts of our chapters to keep ethical practices alive and utilized throughout the year. Ethics Awareness Month is a time to celebrate our high ethical standards and share with our members different ideas and methods to convey this message. Once again, we will use our website as a means of providing chapters with topics, concepts and approaches to Ethics Awareness Month. New activities, articles and polls will be posted.
