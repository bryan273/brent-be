Aside from that, it's not difficult to control. Most registrars have a pretty easy-to-use control panel that will allow you to make updates to your domain name, specify who in your company is in control of it, and what name servers it points to. Once it is pointed to the right name servers, your agency can do everything it needs to handle your account.
