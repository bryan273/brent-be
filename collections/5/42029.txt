Faygo and ICP. Any true Juggalo knows that the only soda that matters is the ghetto pop known as Faygo. ICP grew up drinking Faygo. It's a pop which is also called the poor mans pop, ghetto pop, etc... because it's cheap as hell. At the concerts ICP has these big guns that spray out Faygo. It is almost impossible at an ICP show not to get sprayed.
