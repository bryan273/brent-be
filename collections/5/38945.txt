The main difference between all of your base liquors such as brandy, gin, rum whiskey etc. is what they are distilled from. Brandy is distilled from low quality wine then aged in oak casks to mellow it and give it flavor. Whiskey is distilled from grains and then aged in the same manner as brandy. Rum is distilled from sugar cane and can be drank young or after it has been aged. Gin is distilled from grains like whiskey but they add botanicals such as lemon peel, juniper and cassia to flavor it; gin is not generally aged.
