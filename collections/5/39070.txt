2. ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is formed after the binding of one phosphate molecule (phosphorylation) to one ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecule. This is a process that stores energy in the produced ATP molecule. When ATP provides energy to the cellular metabolism, it releases one of its phosphate ions and ADP reappears. ADP can also release more phosphate ions and generate AMP (adenosine monophosphate) or even non-phosphorylated adenosine.
