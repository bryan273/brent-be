War by Edwin Starr Songfacts. Motown hitmakers Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong wrote this song. Starr began his career recording for Ric-Tic Records, a Detroit label that was a rival to Motown. In 1968, Motown bought Ric-Tic, which gave Starr access to their writers and producers. This is a protest song about the Vietnam War, although it makes a broader statement of the need for harmony in our everyday lives. This was one of the first Motown songs to make a political statement.
