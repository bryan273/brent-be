In the early 1930s, Denny became interested in radio controlled model planes. He and his business partners formed Reginald Denny Industries and opened a model plane shop in 1934 known as Reginald Denny Hobby Shops. He bought a plane design from Walter Righter in 1938 and began marketing it as the Dennyplane, and a model engine called the Dennymite.
