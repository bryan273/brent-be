When Would a Catheter Be Removed. The catheter will usually be removed once the birth is imminent, and may be replaced after the birth, staying several hours postpartum or the next day if all is going well. You may wind up keeping the catheter a bit longer if you have had surgery. This depends on your ability to get up and move around.
