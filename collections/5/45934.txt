A bachelor's degree in an appropriate subject, like chemistry or biology, is the first step. Under normal circumstances, this degree takes four years to acquire. After that, you'll begin your optometry program. This program lasts four years and results in a Doctor of Optometry degree. As of November 2013, there were 23 schools accredited by the American Optometric Association, the accrediting body for optometry schools (www.aoa.org).
