I have stopped taking Garcinia Cambogia after four days due to the following side effects I had: Restless sleep. I couldn't sleep, and would lie awake every 1-2 hours and then drift off for half hour. I take 1/2 sleeping pill one night and only got 3 hour block of sleep.hat that does is cleanse your liver, your lymphatic system, your digestive system your lymph nodes and itâ€™s like a whole internal cleanse that will help balance it when you decide to take the Garcinia cambogia. Hope this helps all of you guys.
