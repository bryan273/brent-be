Suhoor and Iftar. During Ramadan, two main meals are served: suhoor, which is served before dawn, and iftar, which is served after sunset. Suhoor should be a hearty, healthy meal to provide needed energy throughout a day of fasting â€” it ends when the sun rises and the fajr, or morning prayer, begins.
