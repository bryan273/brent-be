Another scale is the Celsius scale. In the Celsius scale the freezing point of water is set at 0 degrees (centigrade) and the boiling point at 100 degrees (centigrade). This scale exists on 100 divisions, also known as centiscale. In 1948 the centidegrees (centigrade scale) were replaced by the degrees Celsius (oC).
