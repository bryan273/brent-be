It is only open in the morning. At other times there is no place to take shelter from the elements other than a small bench enclosure beside the station, a.k.a shack, or standing under a nearby bridge, which is what most people do. The service is a rail link whose only train is SEPTA's so called Norristown regional rail line. Technically the line is not regional since it's stops are too close together. it's really a mostly outdoor subway sort of like the F train in NYC but is three times as expensive and it doesn't go nearly as far.
