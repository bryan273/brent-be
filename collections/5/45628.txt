Short Layover in MSP (Question) - Air Travel Forum. Short Layover in MSP (Question) We are flying Delta from MKE to LAS, with a plane change in MSP on Saturday, Aug. 4th. When we originally booked the trip, there was going to be a 1hr. 30 min. layover in MSP. However, I have now been informed that there will only be a 32 min. layover.
