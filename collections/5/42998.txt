When you have both tall and short cannabis plants in a room the shorter plants miss the same light intensity and the tall plants force you to raise the lights higher than needed. When the tops of the plants in your marijuana garden are relatively even, maximum marijuana yield is easier to obtain. When growing out only one marijuana strain from clones, keeping an even canopy can be as easy as taking all your clones at the same time and treating them equally.
