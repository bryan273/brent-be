Early typewriters had a problem if typists typed too quickly. To try and slow them down, the keyboard was redesigned with the commonly used keys on the left-so 'A', 'S', 'T' and 'E' are under the weaker hand of the typist. The QWERTY layout is common because its what people have been trained to use.
