Aug. 6, 1965: President Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act into law. The act was signed by President Lyndon Johnson. Congress has renewed it four times, and the 2006 renewal won a huge majority in the House and passed the Senate 98-0.That renewal extended the law through 2031.I think what the court did today is stab the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in its very heart, Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was with President Johnson when he signed the law and who was beaten at Selma, said on the MSNBC program “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”.
