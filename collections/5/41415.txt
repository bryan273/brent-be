The gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits just beneath the right lobe of the liver. In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately 8 centimetres (3.1 in) in length and 4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. The gallbladder has a capacity of about 100 mL. The gallbladder is shaped like a tapered sac, with the open end opening into the biliary tree and the cystic duct.
