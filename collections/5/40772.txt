The sclera is the fibrous layer around the eye, commonly known as the white of the eye.. It extends completely around the globe, except at the extreme anterior region, where it meets the cornea. The sclera is completely opaque, preventing light from entering the eye except through the cornea. While only 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick, the sclera is rather rigid and stiff. The stiffness of the sclera helps to protect and maintain the spherical shape of the globe. If the eye's shape is altered, it cannot properly focus patterns of light on the retina and vision becomes impaired.
