And the ledger - a length of dimensional lumber that supports the floor joists - is a key part of the structure. Get the aluminum flashing out. Assuming the ledger is pressure-treated softwood, aluminum flashing is a very poor idea. It should be replaced with something more suitable. The reason lies with the chemicals used as wood preservatives. Lumber treated with chromated copper arsenate was taken off the residential market at the end of 2003. It was replaced by two other preservatives: alkaline copper quat (usually just called ACQ for short) and copper azole (CA).
