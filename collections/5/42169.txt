March 20, 2017. Most people consider the first day of spring to be the Spring Equinox, which will start this year at 6:29 a.m. EDT, March 20th. This is because, astronomically speaking, the sun is directly overhead of the Equator as the Earth`s tilt begins to point the northern hemisphere towards the sun.
