Report Abuse. Hello, Yes, 'biannual' means twice a year. It is biennial (note the spelling is ONE letter different!!!) that means every two years. You can also use the term semi-annual for twice a year. Now I was ready to tell you different and then I looked it up in this source: http://www.bartleby.com/68/34/834.html. This is always a great source for many language questions: www.bartleby.com --I was using the 'usage' section for this question.
