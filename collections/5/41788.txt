Grandfathered plans don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions or preventive care. You can switch to a Marketplace plan that will cover them during Open Enrollment. You can buy a Marketplace plan outside Open Enrollment when your grandfathered plan year ends, and you’ll qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.
