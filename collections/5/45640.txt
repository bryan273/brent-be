Hey,Awhile back I heard of a town that all the residents had disappeared from,or vanished. food on the tables,no sign of struggle,and there was a word scratched in a tree? anyone have a theory on what had happened? what was the word? where was it/what town/what island and such? when was it? the late 1800's?...
