The LDH test is generally used to screen for tissue damage. This damage may be acute (as in the case of a traumatic injury) or chronic (due to a long-term condition such as liver disease or certain types of anemia). It also may be used to monitor progressive conditions, such as muscular dystrophy and HIV.
