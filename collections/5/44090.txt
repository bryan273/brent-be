On 2 July 1778, Rousseau died one month after Voltaire's death. In October 1794, Rousseau's remains were moved to the PanthÃ©on, where they were placed near the remains of Voltaire. Louis XVI, while incarcerated in the Temple, had remarked that Rousseau and Voltaire had destroyed France, by which he meant his dynasty.
