Exothermic- the word describes a process that releases energy in the form of heat. Forming a chemical bond releases energy and therefore is an exothermic process. Exothermic reactions usually feel hot because it is giving heat to you. Endothermic - a process or reaction that absorbs energy in the form of heat. Breaking a chemical bond requires energy and therefore is Endothermic.
