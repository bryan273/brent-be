Last year, a McLaren F1 sold at auction for $4.1 million! I now realize this is the greatest investment I've ever made. In less than 10 years, I more than quintupled my money. Best of all, I have a car I really enjoy. But there are plenty of modern cars you can buy at real-world prices that are fun to own.ast year, a McLaren F1 sold at auction for $4.1 million!
