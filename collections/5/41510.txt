Try to cultivate existing soil before applying new top soil so as to avoid creating a hard pan in the sub layer. For preparing ground prior to turfing, cultivate the top layer of soil to a depth of 100mm and apply Top Soil to build up area where existing topsoil is thin and level off any dips or falls.
