1. The Force is applied to the Wheel. For example, a screwdriver is an example of a wheel and axle. The handle is the wheel where the force is applied. It turns or spins and increases the force of the shaft or axle, which helps turn the screw. Another example of force being applied to the wheel is when a doorknob is turned.
