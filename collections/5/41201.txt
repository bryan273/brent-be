We often hear healthcare providers complain that patients don’t follow their treatment. plans – ‘they are non-compliant.’ The blame for not adhering to health instructions and. the treatment plan is usually placed on the patient. Unfortunately, we rarely look at how. our communications and interactions with patients are a large part of the underlying. problem for non-adherence.
