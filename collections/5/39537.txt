A normal domestic house roof of 350 m2 roof area would take 6 teams about seven days to thatch. How much does it cost?The cost of a thatch roof is dependant primarily on the maximum span of the roof.The greater the span, the higher the cost per square meter.es. Thatched roofs do keep out water. This is possible because of the minimum pitch of 45 degrees, and because the thatching grass is a waxy organic material that is packed to a density of approximately 35 kg/m2 throughout the roof.
