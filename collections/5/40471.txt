How do you start on the path toward remarriage? I suppose by dating each other again. You'd get dressed up, pick up your ex, and go to a fancy restaurant -- all with romantic overtures? If you continue to date, what would it be like to kiss again? Have sex again? The mind reels. I scoured the Internet for statistics on remarriage to the same person. I wanted to find out how common the practice is and the likelihood of success. But I couldn't find any stats. My guess? I'll bet way more than 50 percent of these marriage do-overs end in divorce. I found a few articles that offered advice to consider before remarrying your ex.
