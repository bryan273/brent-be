–Fibroblasts now migrate into the wound, and secrete collagen type III. –Angiogenesis occurs by 48 hours. –The secretion of collagen, macrophage remodeling and secretion, and angiogenesis continues for up to 3 weeks. –The greatest increase in wound strength occurs during this phase. Wound Healing – Maturation phase is the final phase and starts from the 3rd week and continues for up to 9-12 months.– This is where collagen III is converted to collagen I, and the tensile strength continues to increase up to 80% of normal tissue.
