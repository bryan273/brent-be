Reagan decided to run, telling his wife Nancy that he did not think they could run away from it.. And he won the Republican primary, against the former mayor of San Francisco, Warren Christopher. Then it was Reagan against Governor Pat Brown, the man who had won against Richard Nixon's run for governor in 1962. Reagan appeared before groups and took a lot of questions, knowing that his responses would appear less scripted than a speech.
