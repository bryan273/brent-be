Calculating Calories. If you have a thick 3-ounce slice of roasted ham, you could have upwards of over 230 calories. But if you trim away the fat as much as possible before cooking, your calorie count could go down to closer to 180 calories. Regular cured deli ham provides between 130 and 140 calories from 3 ounces.
