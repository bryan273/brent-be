Making the world better, one answer at a time. Only 6 Northwest Indian tribes produced totem poles. The Tlingit tribe, the Haida tribe, the Bella Coola tribe, the Kwakiutl tribe, the Tsimshian tribe, and the West Coast tribe. While poles made by Native American tribes are the most famously  known, the Mayans, Aztecs, Native Canadians, Native Australians,  Maori, ingenious Koreans and ingenious Chinese are also known to  have built totem poles.
