Definition: an independent (main) clause expressing a command or exhortation (the only use of the subjunctive in a main clause formally introduced in Wheelock). E.g., “Let us study this lesson carefully.” Recognition: easily recognized, since the sentence's main verb (and often its only verb) is subjunctive; negatives are introduced by nē.
