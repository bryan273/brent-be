FADH2 and NADH are created from FAD and NAD+ through redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions in the Krebs cycle during respiration as seen below here: This cycle gives off small amounts of energy in the form of ATP (adenonsine triphosphate, cell energy) and produces these compounds, FADH2 and NADH.asically, the NADH and FADH2 molecules are affixed with electrons and are transferred to the inner membrane of the mitochondria. They travel down the electron transport chain, releasing the electrons that they once had.
