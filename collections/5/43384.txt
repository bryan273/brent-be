As melanin is a complex living molecule abundants in Africans it aids protecting Africans from ultraviolet rays-and like dark clothes are not worn in the sun due to its ability to hold heat attracting sun rays, the analogy is the same for melanin dominant beings, the sun is drawn to them creating amazing things.itamin D-Is needed for calcium absorbtion and this is converted from the sun's UV rays and us melaninated beings require at least 20 minutes daily sunlight on at least the face and arms (preferably not washing until at least 30minutes after to allow absorbtion into the bloodstream).
