I felt like I got to see many different sides of life on the island. One thing about that vacation Iâ€™ve never forgotten was the night we went to Glistening Waters. Victor, a family friend from Trelawny, told us about a restaurant in Falmouth where after dinner the staff take you out on a boat to the Luminous Lagoon, where the water glows.
