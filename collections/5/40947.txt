Best Answer: 50 - 70 psi would be a good level and 70 psi is on the verge of too much. That would be the short answer. You get more dynamic pressure when pipes reduce going into fixtures, but the water pressure stays the same. What I mean by that is like water flowing thru a shower head will increase the power (speed) of flow but the pressure on the lines remains static or the same.
