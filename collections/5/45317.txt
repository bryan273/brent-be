Silestone is a man-made solid surface countertop made of quartz, resin for binding, and pigment (or color). There are many manufacturers of quartz countertops, but Silestone is unique in that it incorporates a layer of germ and bacteria protection in the molecular level of the countertop during production. This protection, called Microban, and doesn't wash away or fade with use.
