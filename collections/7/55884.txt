1 Class A motorhomes are the largest and most expensive category of motorized RV. 2  Premium costs depend on the motorhome's age, size and value, and frequency of use. 3  RVersOnline.org estimates average insurance costs of $1,000-$1,300 a year for a gas-powered Class A motorhome used 140 days each year. Full-timer coverage is similar to homeowners insurance because it includes liability for accidents in the RV or campsite while used as a place of residence. 2  Full-timer insurance can also cover a vehicle towed behind the motorhome.
