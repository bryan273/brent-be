In most Universities in the United States, the average number of credit hours required to complete a master’s degree program ranges from about 35 to 45 credit hours. Each course may be assessed with a value of 3-4 credit hours depending on the University’s chosen credit-hour system. Assuming that each course taken is worth three credit hours, a typical master’s degree program may require taking 10-15 courses to complete the master’s program requirement.
