4. Re: weather in june/july. Aug 01, 2011, 8:30 AM. We stayed in Carrigaholt for three months in July, I would say half of it was rainy , windy and chilly. We went to North Ireland the third week of July and had hard rain and wind the entire trip. We were told ever place we stopped, that it was the worst summer ever and they were still waiting for the nice weather.
