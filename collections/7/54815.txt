Since September and October are the height of the hurricane season it is going to be very, very humid which you don't find in April at all. We also frequently go in April (will be there for 2 weeks soon!) and the weather is very different. In April, nice warm days, cool nights and very cold water- no humidity. In October you will have hot days, warm nights and very warm water.
