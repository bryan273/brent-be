Itching during exercise can cause an uncomfortable, distracting sensation, and stopping to scratch the itch often just makes you itchier. Exercising in certain environmental conditions might cause or exacerbate itching, and people with allergies and other medical conditions have an increased risk of being itchy during exercise. Itching during exercise is preventable and treatable with lifestyle changes and possibly medical care.
