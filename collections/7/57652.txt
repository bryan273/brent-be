Fat-soluble vitamins -- A, D, E and K -- dissolve in fat to be absorbed and stored for later use. Water-soluble vitamins are not easily stored and surplus amounts are excreted in your urine. Fat-soluble vitamins require bile acids for absorption and are stored in the liver and fatty tissue of the body.
