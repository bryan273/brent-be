Unlike cattle, which are typically fed a mix of hay of varying quality, grains and silage, horses need good hay as their primary feed to stay healthy. Chicago said her store is selling a bale of good-quality alfalfa hay, the most common type in Arizona, for $18. At the start of the year, the same bale cost $11.50. At Arizona Feeds Country Store, owner Kevin Bloomquist said his price for alfalfa hay has gone from about $9 a year ago to about $18 to $19 a bale now.
