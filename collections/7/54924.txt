Isran's Speech [edit]. When you return to Fort Dawnguard, you will see that Isran has tightened security and made several changes to the exterior, including a gate and more wooden barricades. Enter the fort and you will find Gunmar and Sorine in the main hall, with Isran looking down at them from the balcony above.
