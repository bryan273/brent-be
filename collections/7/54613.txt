Discrete parts of each chromosome — the genes — control different aspects of the animal or plant’s structure or function. The number of genes varies just as the number of chromosomes does. Humans are thought to have about 23,000 genes. The size of various genes varies greatly. The smaller genes consist of only a few thousand base-pairs of DNA, while the longest human genes may contain more than 2 million base pairs. Sometimes, genes occur in different versions. For example, a gene may control an animal’s pigment.
