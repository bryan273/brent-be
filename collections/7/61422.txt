Why evening is the best time to exercise. Everyone knows how important it is to fit some exercise into a busy working week. But now it appears that the time you choose for a strenuous workout is crucial in determining its effectiveness. Scientists say that those who go to the gym - or for a jog - after work are likely to attain a higher level of fitness than those who exercise first thing in the morning. They found that the body's metabolism seems to adapt better to a keep-fit routine in the evening or night-time.
