In so doing, they act as a transformer, converting sound vibrations in the external ear canal into fluid waves in the inner ear. The inner ear chamber contains tiny hearing and balance nerve endings bathed in fluid. The inner ear is a delicate, tissue-lined sense organ, which is encased in an outer hard bony shell. These two parts are suspended within the sponge-like ear bone (temporal bone).
