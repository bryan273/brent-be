Otologists and otolaryngologists are both medical doctors specializing in treatment of diseases of the ear, nose, larynx, head and neck. An otologist is an otolaryngologist who has additional training in treating certain areas and disorders related to the ears, nasal passages, throat and neck. Many people refer to otolaryngologists simply as ENTs, which stands for ear, nose and throat doctors.
