Sabra (Hebrew: צבר ‬, tzabar) is an informal-turned-formal term that refers to any Jew born on Israeli territory. The term first appeared in the 1930s to refer to a Jew who had been born in the land of Israel (inclusive of the British Mandate of Palestine and Ottoman Palestine; cf. New Yishuv & Old Yishuv).
