Hydrophobic (can't permeate the membrane) substances diffuse throughout the membranes with the assistance of transport protein, either channel protein or carrier protein. Protein with channel opening out -> enter ion -> channel closes-> (if) electrical change outside cell-> protein change shape -> ion exits into cell.
