Slope is the incline of the roof expressed as a ratio of the vertical rise to the horizontal run, where the run is some portion of the span. This ratio is always expressed as inches per foot. Slope Ratio. A roof that rises 4 inches for every 1 foot or 12 inches of run is said to have a 4 in 12 slope.If the rise is 6 inches for every 12 inches of run, then the roof slope is 6 in 12. The slope can be expressed numerically as a ratio.The slope ratio represents a certain amount of vertical rise for every 12 inches of horizontal run.oth pitch and slope indicate the incline of a roof, expressed as a proportion of the vertical to the horizontal. This article describes both roof slope and roof pitch, and the differences between them, as they are not the same.
