Love when Carla Hall comes to visit! Paddle Boarding!! I first came to the Leelanau Peninsula over a decade ago. My wife, Susi, went to college in Michigan, and she had friends near Traverse City. We rented a house on a little beach for a week. The next year it was two weeks, the next year three, then four. We ended up buying a 1940’s fish camp on Lake Michigan, did some renovation, put in a pizza oven, and fell in love with the place. Now we’re here from late June until Labor Day weekend.
