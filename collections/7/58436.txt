There is usually one GobbleGum machine in every area of every map. The first GobbleGum will cost 500 points. After that, the price will continue to grow but will reset after the round ends. The increase in price will vary depending on what round the player is currently on. On rounds 1-9 the second GobbleGum will cost 1500 points; on rounds 10-19 it will be 2500 points; on rounds 20-29 it costs 4500 points; and on rounds 30-39 it will cost the player 8500 points.
