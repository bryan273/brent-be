I know we'll need an electronic brake controller, but if we don't have one installed before we pick up a Casita 17' would you drive the trailer home (say less than 500 miles) without it? We hope to have a trailer next weekend and would be borrowing a friend's truck to bring it home as we don't yet have a tow vehicle.
