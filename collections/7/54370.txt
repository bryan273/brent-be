Can the Tibetans Speak English? When we travel to some places, communication with the locals is important and sometimes, necessary. However, language is always an obstacle, because different regions have different languages, especially when we travel abroad. Thanks to the popularization of English, now, English is an international language and many people know it. Then, can the Tibetans speak English, too? During your Tibet tours, you may want very much to talk with the local Tibetans. However, generally speaking, most Tibetans can not speak English. English is only spoken at foreigner's hotels or some star hotels in the big cities like Lhasa and Shigatse.
