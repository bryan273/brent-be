Thread: Taste of Wild vs. Blue Buffalo. Taste of Wild vs. Blue Buffalo Hi , I recently switched my dogs from Nutro (yes, I never knew how bad a food this was till this forum) to Taste of the Wild Venison. I gradually switched over and now after 5 days of only TOW my 2 Cockers have very bad gas and the craps.
