There is no such thing as a Paul Harris Fellowship, and it is not an award; it is simply recognition. When a Club contributes $US1000 to The Rotary Foundation, the Club sets its own criteria for naming a Paul Harris Fellow. Usually this is done to recognise an outstanding commitment to the Club or the community.
