In general, when the relative humidity is high (the air is nearly saturated with moisture) the dew point will be close to the air temperature (at 100% Relative Humidity, the dew point is equal to the air temperature). When the relative humidity is low, the dew point is much lower than the air temperature. If the amount of water in the air remains constant, the dew point will be steady, even as the temperature changes. Conversely, if the dew point is rising, more moisture is being absorbed by the air.
