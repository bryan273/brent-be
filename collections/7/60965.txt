Oral Thrush Causes. Thrush is caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Candida albicans, which is commonly found on skin surfaces, the oral cavity, and throughout the intestinal tract of healthy individuals. Newborn infants often are exposed during vaginal delivery and may develop oral evidence of thrush within 10 days post-delivery.
