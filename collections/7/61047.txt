Your fibula, that long bone on the outer part of your lower leg, does not bear weight through your ankle. It only helps to make up the lateral wall of your ankle joint. There are 4 motions of your ankle: dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion. Several muscles attach near your ankle and help it move. Your ankle also has ligaments that attach one bone to another. These ligaments help prevent excessive motion around your ankle joint.
