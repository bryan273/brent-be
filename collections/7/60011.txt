Let me encourage you to read your Bible, pray, be involved in your Church and with other believers and non-believers….but most of all….remind yourself of the Gospel, each day! This will humble yourself because you’ll realize…daily…that you can’t do this on your own and you need Jesus more than anyone else you know.
