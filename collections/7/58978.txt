What to Pack. Let sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, UV-protective sunglasses and adequate hydration be your constant travel companions (pack insect repellant, too, particularly for outings planned near mangroves or wooded or secluded areas). And to outsmart summer showers, always carry an umbrella and/or poncho. In late spring and summer, breezy, casual clothes work best. Fall and winter temperatures vary from mild to cool, so determine in advance of your visit whether shorts and sandals are still in season or if itâ€™s time to pack a light jacket and pants.
