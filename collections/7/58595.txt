What are the good fats and where can you find them? Try eating omega-3 fats found in fish such as salmon, which can contribute to decreased fat storage. You should also eat monosaturated fats found in meats, nuts, avocados and whole milk products. Remember, these fats are good but should still be eaten in small amounts.
