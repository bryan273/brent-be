Dependent Student: If it is determined that you are a dependent student, you must report parent(s) income and assets as well as your own. Federal aid programs are based on the concept that a dependent student's parent(s) have the primary responsibility for their children's education. If you do not meet the independent student criteria, parent information is required.
