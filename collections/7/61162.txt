Buying a Car Privately, Don’t: 1  Rely on the owner’s mechanic for an inspection. 2  Buy a car sight unseen or without a test drive. 3  Buy without checking to see if the title is clear.  Bring a lot of 1  cash. Meet at night.  Believe everything the seller tells you, or at least take it all with a grain of salt.
