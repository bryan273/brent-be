Have you ever wondered... The Abraham Lincoln ghost is by far the most famous spirit to haunt the White House. Probably the first known sighting of the Lincoln apparition at the White House was recorded in a newspaper story related by doorman Jerry Smith in 1903. Sightings usually place Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Bedroom and Yellow Oval Room.
