In addition, Nisan is the first of the six summer months, which correspond to six levels of direct light (in Divine service–“arousal from above”). This is alluded to in its synonym “the month of spring” (אביב), whose first two letters, alef (א) and beit (ב),are in the direct or straight order of the Hebrew alphabet.
