C too small, so copied everything off D; to another physical drive in server, deleted the DATAPART partition assigned as D:, and extended the OS/C: partition, Server won't restart as it can't find edb.log on D:, Now I can only get to a command prompt.To make it worse, this reassigns the drives as C: - RECOVERY and the OS drive as D, (formerly C), and I can't see how use DISKPART to assign a drive letter to the extended partition on the OS volume, and make it persist. Load the System hive (the one located on the correct System Drive). 2  Navigate to this location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\{HiveName}\SYSTEM\MountedDevices. 3  If the value \DosDevices\D: exists (bottom, right-hand pane), rename it to \DosDevices\Q: 4  Rename one of the other values to \DosDevices\D:.
