The buyer didn't pay and you've waited at least 4 days after you opened the case. The buyer paid but didn't use an approved electronic payment method. You need to wait 4 full days before you can close a case. For example, if you opened a case on October 5 at 11:15 am, you can close the case on October 9 at 11:15 am.
