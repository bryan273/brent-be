When a baby has thrush, the yeast can cause a diaper rash at the same time as thrush. Your doctor may prescribe nystatin cream or ointment for his or her diaper area. To treat thrush in adults, at first you will probably use medicine that goes directly on the white patches, such as a liquid or a lozenge.
