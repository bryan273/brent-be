Jamestown, the island between Newport and the mainland, is blessed with beautiful beaches and wooded roads. At the south end of the island is Beavertail Park, with a lighthouse and elevated paths above rocky beaches â€“ great for exploring tidal sea life. The Rhode Island mainland area east of Newport is known as the East Bay, with quiet country roads and the pretty towns of Tiverton, Barrington, Bristol, and Little Compton.
