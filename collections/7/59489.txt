I think the Update Aquatic will add a change to the oceans and water biomes that Minecraft has needed for a while! It also introduces us to new changes, blocks, and items that will be nice to have. A big update to Minecraft has been need for a while and the Minecraft 1.14 Update Aquatic coming in 2018, that was introduced at Minecon Earth 2017, will be a nice big change to the game! Let me know of any turtle mechanics that you think would be useful!
