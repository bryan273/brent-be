Fall Fishing. September is one of the best months for catching coho salmon in the saltwater areas just past the mouth of the Puyallup where it enters Puget Sound, and chinook salmon start heading up the river about the same time. By October, the chinook are pretty much gone, but the coho are now in the rivers.
