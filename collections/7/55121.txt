Radon Entry into Buildings Most soil gas reaching the surface is quickly diluted by the surrounding air. In the event that a structure is built in or on top of the soil, the dilution of the radon does not take place as quickly, and the radon in the structure may accumulate.adon and Health When radon decays, it too produces a decay chain, with its own daughters. During its decay, it releases a large atomic alpha particle and the atom is transmuted into polonium. An alpha particle is essentially an helium atom stripped of its electrons.
