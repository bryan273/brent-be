Lipase is an enzyme found in the pancreas (pan-kree-us). An enzyme (n-zime) is a protein that helps speed up a chemical reaction in your body. The pancreas is a small organ located near the stomach. Many of the enzymes released from the pancreas help break food down so it can be used by your body. Serum lipase levels are used in the diagnosis of acute (severe) pancreatitis (pan-kree-uh-ti-tis). The pancreas is the organ in your body with the most lipase activity.
