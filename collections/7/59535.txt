42 Responses to NEW SERIES | Hallmark’s CHESAPEAKE SHORES With Meghan Ory & Jesse Metcalfe to Film in Parksville/Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island from Mid-May to July. 1  I enjoyed the books so much. I hope the tv series is just as good. 2  I’m watching the new series “Chesapeake Shores”. So far it’s OK but as a resident of real Chesapeake shores I knew right away this movie was not filmed on Chesapeake Bay. This movie was filmed on Vancouver Island, Canada,not even in the US! MAJOR FOUL, Hallmark!
