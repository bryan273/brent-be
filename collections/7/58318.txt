October marks the anniversary both of his birth and of his arrest as the leader of one of the United States' most famous slave rebellions. Nat Turner was born October 2, 1800 on a plantation in Southampton County, Virginia. Turner was deeply committed to his Christian faith and believed he received messages from God through visions and signs in nature. When he was in his early 20s, these signs led him to return to his master after an escape attempt.
