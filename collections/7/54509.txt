The bigger the rotor blades, the more energy they can capture from the wind. The giant blades (typically 70 m or 230 feet in diameter, which is about 30 times the wingspan of an eagle) multiply the wind's force like a wheel and axle, so even a gentle breeze is enough to make the outer edges of the blades turn around.
