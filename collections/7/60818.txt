Your leather purse holds a little bit of everything: money, makeup and even food. It's no surprise, then, when the bag starts to smell less than fresh. Cash and coins carry odor-causing bacteria, for example. Food crumbs can rot, causing a bad smell in the purse that never seems to go away. Cleaning your purse thoroughly is the best way to remove strong odors and make the bag smell nice again.
