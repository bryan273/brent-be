Jerome Kern and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II underscored the musical's racial themes by closing the entire show with a reprise of the first act's leitmotif, the song Ol' Man River.. Ol' Man River, thus treated as the show's unifying theme, is a melody first sung by one of the African-American dockworkers.
