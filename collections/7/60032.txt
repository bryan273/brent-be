Well in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still. He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down. Then he'd fill up a jug and he'd pass it around.ell in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still. He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down.
