This estimate is based on a number of research projects undertaken over the last 20 years. In 2010, the Centre for Disability Research (CeDR) produced a report commissioned by Sense that estimated the total number of people with sight and hearing loss in the UK, currently and in the future. As we age, our hearing and sight deteriorate.
