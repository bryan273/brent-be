For those that know nothing about the Bronze Age, hereâ€™s a couple of links: http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/cultures/europe/bronze_age.aspx. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age_Britain. The British Late Bronze Age lasted from 1300-600 BC. This period is broken down in to a small number of phases, based on the bronze objects types, which we call LBA (Late Bronze Age) 1, 2, 3 and 4.
