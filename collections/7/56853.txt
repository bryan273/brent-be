Material Girl Lyrics. [Verse 1] I got a confession to make. I don't rush a date. Commitment is an enemy to me. But ever since her lips touched my face. It's like a kiss was laced. I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'. I usually like to slow down the pace. Love to tease and play. But girl I need to be direct with you. Cause in my mind your voice just replays.
