Most people I encounter seem to believe that the concept of a Pre-Tribulation Rapture originated in the writings of C. I. Scofield, as expressed in his famous study Bible that was published in 1909. It is true that Scofieldâ€™s writing helped to popularize the idea, but he was by no means the originator of it.
