Differences Between CCR5 and Fusin. NSI (non-syncitium inducing) strains of HIV are the most common sexually transmitted form of the virus. This type of HIV preferentially infects macrophages (often found in the skin and mucous membrane) rather than T-cells.Therefore, it is macrophage-tropic, or M-tropic. When HIV is transmitted sexually, it first establishes itself as an M-tropic virus, later developing into T-cell-tropic viruses in some people.ifferences Between CCR5 and Fusin.
