Turmeric can be used in diet or by combining with other herbs to benefit arthritis. Small pieces of ginger and turmeric can be boiled for 15-30 minutes in water, strained, cooled and drunk with some honey. Equal proportions of fenugreek, turmeric and ginger can be ground to powder and kept in a sealed container.
