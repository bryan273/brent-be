One larvae will eat about 400 medium-size aphids during its development to the pupal stage. An adult ladybug may eat over 5,000 aphids during its lifetime (about a year). When not being used, ladybugs may be stored in the refrigerator, where they live off their body fat. (Keep the temperature between 35-45 F.) They appear almost dead in the refrigerator, but quickly become active when warmed up.
