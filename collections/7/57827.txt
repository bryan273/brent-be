In 2008, former Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom persuaded Japan to pay for a $60 million seawall of concrete tetrapods around the capital city of Male, and retaining walls have since been built on other islands.n the U.S., Alaska's village of Kivalina has constructed a wall to hold the waters back.

Even California coastal towns are preparing for rising waters.
