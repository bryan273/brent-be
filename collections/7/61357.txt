Read the expert review. The 2014 Buick Encore may be small, but it doesn't deliver the fuel efficiency you might expect from a subcompact car. The Encore is rated at 28 miles per gallon combined (25 mpg city, 33 mpg highway) in its standard front-wheel drive configuration. Add all-wheel drive, however, and that falls to 26 mpg combined (23 mpg city, 30 mpg highway).
