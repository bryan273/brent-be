But even before that time completely closed cars were called saloons or limousines, like the 1905 Rational 4-door limousine or the 1907 Renault 4-door limousine or the 1910 Stella 2-door saloon. The words saloon or limousine do not exclusively mean a fully closed car. Cars which are called sedans are almost always fully closed. The term convertible sedan was used in the 1930s to describe a car with a soft, foldable top and roll-up windows, very much like a convertible coupe.
