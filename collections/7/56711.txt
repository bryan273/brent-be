The peak age for injury to the growth plate is in the pre-adolescent growth spurt. The Salter-Harris type II fracture is the most common type. Distal radial physeal fractures are uncommon in children younger than five years. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on an outstretched hand (Figure 1).xtension of the wrist at the time of injury causes the distal fragment to be displaced dorsally (posteriorly). Commonly there is an associated ulna fracture (greenstick, physeal or styloid). Figure 1: Dorsal (posterior) displacement of the distal fragment is usually the result of a fall on an extended wrist.
