There are two main types of trailer brakes, hydraulic and electric. Hydraulic brakes are just like the ones on your car, a hydraulic master cylinder pushes fluid to the pistons on the wheel hubs on each axle, operating the brake pads, slowing down the trailer. These are commonly found on boat trailers and some others.
