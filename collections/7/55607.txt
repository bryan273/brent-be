What is the difference between a neurohormone and a neurotranmitter? A neurohormone is a chemical that is released by neurons that act at a specific distant site or sites. Examples of neurohormones are TRH (Thyrotropin releasing hormone), dopamine or epinephrine. A neurotransmiter is a compound that binds to receptors on neurons that either stimulate or inhibit the action potential. Examples are acetylcholine, GABA or dopamine.
