Shakespeare's Hamlet follows this definition for the most part, and even though it is not always in agreement with Aristotle's guidelines, it is still an effective tragedy. Aristotle states that tragedy is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude. Hamlet is a good example of this. The play is mainly about Hamlet's mission to avenge his father's death, and this is a 'serious' action.
