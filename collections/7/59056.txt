The frequency of GERD did not significantly affect the risk for AF, although patients with more frequent GERD had a slightly higher AF risk. Esophagitis increased the risk for AF (HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.35â€“2.78; p < 0.001), but the association did not persist when accounting for other risk factors (p < 0.72)
