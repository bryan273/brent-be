Did you know there was a phone number for kids to use to call Santa Claus and talk directly to him? The North Pole is pretty busy this time of year, but there are still two days left for kids to call and talk to the big man himself or even Mrs. Claus or the elves. The number is: 1-800-726-8222 (1-800-Santa BA) Below you can read the whole story which is for adult eyes onlyâ€¦.
