MS Word 2010 - Mail - Envelopes - Default Settings Not Saving. In addressing Envelopes for printing, the initial default settings for the return address will not save after they are changed and the button pushed to make these the default settings. MS Word 2010 gives the acknowledgement screen concerning the new defaults, but when I go back to print another envelope, the old settings remain.
