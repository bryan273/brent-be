Although these insects are commonly called “ladybugs,” they are members of the beetle order, Coleoptera. The Coleoptera are unique from other orders in that they undergo complete. metamorphosis (that is, have larva and pupa stages in their life cycle), and their forewings have. modified into a hardened cover (elytra) that protects the insect. “True” bugs belong to the. order Hemiptera, and include boxelder bugs, plant bugs, and squash bugs.
