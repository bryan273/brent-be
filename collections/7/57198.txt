Symptoms. Hyperglycemia doesn't cause symptoms until glucose values are significantly elevated â€” above 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 11 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Symptoms of hyperglycemia develop slowly over several days or weeks. The longer blood sugar levels stay high, the more serious the symptoms become.
