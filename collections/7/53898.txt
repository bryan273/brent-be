What distinguishes the blackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus (receptacle or stem) picks with (i.e., stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus does stay with the fruit. With a raspberry, the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit.
