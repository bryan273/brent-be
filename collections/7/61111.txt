Size Matters. How long chilled lasagna takes to cook depends mostly on the size of the pan, as well as the oven temperature. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake an 8-inch square pan of lasagna for 40 to 50 minutes. A refrigerated lasagna in a 9- by 13-inch baking pan will need between 55 and 70 minutes, while a jumbo-sized pan needs 70 to 85 minutes.
