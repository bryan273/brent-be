Talk with your doctor about your medicines before scheduling the PFT. If you use an inhaler or take breathing medicine regularly, do not use or take those within 4 hours before your test. Do not exercise before the PFT. Save your energy so you can give your best effort during the test. The day of the PFT, bring with you any breathing medicine that you take. You may need your quick-relief inhaler during or after the test. The PFT will take 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete.
