Each drug product is defined by its ingredient(s), strength and drug form. E.g., Acetaminophen 250 mg Oral Tablet (Standard Vocabulary concept 19107242) contains the ingredient Acetaminophen at a strength of 250 mg, and is formulated as an oral tablet. In the OMOP Standard Vocabulary, you can query the ingredient and the form for each drug product. Use the Standard Vocabulary Queries if you need help how to do it. However, the strength is not prorvided by RxNorm and not part of the Standard Vocabulary. We therefore created an additional supplemental table DRUG_STRENGTH. It is included in the distribution file of the OMOP Standard Vocabulary.
