Nisan is the first month of the Jewish calendar. The first commandment given to the newly born nation of Israel before the Exodus from Egypt was: “This month [the month of Nisan] shall be for you the first of the months” (Exodus 12:2). The month of Nisan begins, in particular, the period (tekufah) of the spring.
