The grill marks are nice. Food does look grilled, and the little black dents are satisfyingly crusty. If you have the model that fits over two burners (which we do), you get a lot of surface area. You can cook many chicken breasts, kabobs, or vegetables in one go. If your pan is a reversible one that flips over to be a griddle, you can make pancakes.
