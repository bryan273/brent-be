Your analogy is flawed. Carbon dating would be more like a runner running in a straight line. The runner would start at a rate of 60 miles per hour and slow down at a specific rate of speed over the course of her run. For the sake of this example lets say she slows down 1 mph every 5 minutes she is running.
