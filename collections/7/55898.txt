Patients like this with middle-range MELD scores are difficult. Sick, but not sick enough to get transplanted. Two suggestions: (1) talk with the transplant team and see if MELD exceptions are an option to raise his score; (2) get evaluated at a center that transplants at lower MELD scores. Try University of Indiana. Good luck. Dr. Joe Galati
