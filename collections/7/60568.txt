Officially Maryland had no State Religion but you did have to be Christian and a believer in the Holy Trinity. Because the headright system was used to populate the Colony a wealthy, powerful and Catholic minority controlled the majority of the Colony.  To make matters worse Virginia imposed a State Religion which forced the Puritan minority to seek refuge in Maryland.
