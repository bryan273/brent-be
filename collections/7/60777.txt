When can a child refuse visitation? At what age can a child legally refuse visitation? Is there an age, when the only reason a child doesn't want to go is because of her social life, that a child can refuse to go for summer visitation? Update: I am the step mom. It is my step daughter who doesn't want to come see her father. And the mother is urging the daughter not to go if she does not want to.
