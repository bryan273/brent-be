We all need energy to function. We get this energy from the foods we eat. The most efficient way for cells to harvest energy stored in food is through cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that captures the chemical energy from foods in the form of ATP.Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria and consists of three stages.e all need energy to function.
