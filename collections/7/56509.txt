$2,120 of $2,120 goal. Hello, my name is Andrew Prezioso, and I am planning an Eagle scout service project to replace benches at a church camp called Mowana. Mowana has been my summer church camp for many years, and it has done much to strengthen my faith. Camp Mowana is a place where the light of Christ shines through to all who come.
