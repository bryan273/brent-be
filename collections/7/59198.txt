Saturday morning feeling angry, anxious, negative thoughts, life feels like a burden, depression. I take 1/2 gram oil orally aprox. 90mg CBD within the first hour im little more relaxed. Within 3 hours mood lifts, relaxed and enjoyed the rest of the night followed by a good 7 hours of sleep. Sunday morning awake feeling ok alittle groggy. I take 1/2 gram oil orally aprox. 90mg CBD, seems to take a few hours to take full effect. uplifted mood for most of the day and feeling of relaxation. Feels like the after effects of smoking marijuana. Seems to last a good 8 hours or more.
