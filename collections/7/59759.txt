A non-commissioned member, in the Canadian Armed Forces, is defined in the Queen's Regulations and Orders as: … any person, other than an officer, who is enrolled in, or who pursuant to law is attached or seconded otherwise than as an officer to, the Canadian Forces… Thus, an NCM is any member who is not a commissioned officer or officer cadet. Officer cadets, while not commissioned members, are classified as officers. The equivalent term in French is militaire du rang.
