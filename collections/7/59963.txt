Invest in a meat thermometer. Without knowing what type of pork roast, the shape of it, fat content, the temperature of your slow cooker, etc. we cannot give you an answer to this. You should never time the cooking of meat from a recipe anyway. You must always check temperatures. Especially for pork. â€“ Mr. Mascaro Dec 29 '14 at 22:08.
