Dwarf mondo grass (Ophiopogon japonicus) can be used in a variety of situations, such as beds and borders, but is an especially good choice for areas that either you donâ€™t want to mow and/or are difficult to mow, like perhaps under a tree or in uneven terrain or a slope where mowing can be difficult.warf mondo grass is similar in appearance to a ground cover commonly called Lilyturf (Liriope muscari), but has thinner leaves and a finer texture.
