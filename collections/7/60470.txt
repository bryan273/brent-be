For those who are sensitive or allergic to tomato plants, a tomato plant rash will appear shortly after the tomato has been touched. The skin will become red, and you may experience extreme itching. Tomato plant allergies can be mild, or they can be extremely severe, causing a great deal of discomfort. Severe reactions may cause wheezing, hives, nausea, vomiting, sneezing and runny nose. It will take several exposures before you will build up the antibodies necessary to counteract the proteins in the tomato.
