Glycolysis can occur with or without oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, glycolysis allows cells to make small amounts of ATP.This process is called fermentation.n the presence of oxygen, glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration.
