In the early part of the war, the T-34 was the best tank in the world, despite drawbacks already mentioned, such as the 2 man turret. It may have been surpassed in firepower and armor by the Panther and Tiger tanks-- which were designed in response to the T-34 and KV tanks-- but was upgraded to the T-34-85.nferior sometime, but allied tanks were certainly not crap. They were, in general, more reliable mechanically than German tanks. It's easy to be awed by the gun and armor of the Panther, but it was a maintenance nightmare throughout its career.
