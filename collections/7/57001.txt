There are three main types of lentils. The most common is the brown lentil, sometimes labeled Indian Brown Lentil or German lentil. I have seen these repeatedly mislabeled as green lentils, but strictly speaking they are not.They are light brown in color and are easy to find on your grocery store shelves.s a result they will cook more quickly than brown or French lentils. These are slightly smaller and not as plump as green lentils and have a milder flavor. In India yellow lentils are known as moong dal and red lentils known as masoor dal. You might also see the pink lentils labeled Egyptian lentils.
