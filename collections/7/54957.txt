By Heather Rhoades. Dwarf mondo grass (Ophiopogon japonicus ‘Nana’) is a Japanese plant that has charmed the gardens of the world. A decorative, low growing plant, this plant looks best when grouped together but sometimes there may only be a few plants available.This is where dwarf mondo grass propagation comes in handy.lant the dwarf mondo grass clumps in the locations you would like them to grow in. Water them thoroughly and weep well watered for the first few weeks until them become established. The best time to divide your mondo grass in in the early spring or early fall.
