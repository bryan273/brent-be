Is so, check the back of the box for a code starting with WBR. This is usually located near a barcode on the box. Once you have that code, send a message to Webroot Support and include that WBR code in your message. With that code, the Support Team will be able to send you a copy of your keycode. If you're not able to find a WBR code, not to worry. If you purchased Webroot at Best Buy, call the Best Buy Assurance Center at 1-800-433-5778.
