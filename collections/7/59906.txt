Step 1: Place eggs in a saucepan of cold water on the stove. The water should just cover the eggs. Step 2: Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Step 3: When the water boils, immediately cover the pan and turn off the heat (leaving the pan where it is). Let the pan sit for 5 minutes. Step 4: Transfer the eggs to a separate bowl to cool for 2 minutes. Run cold water over the eggs for a few seconds after they've cooled and then drain it off. Step 5: Crack each egg on one side and then on the opposite side. Step 6: Gently roll the egg back and forth to create a web of broken shell.
