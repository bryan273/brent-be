An Overview of the Uses for Benzonatate. Benzonatate (TessalonÂ®) is a prescription cough medication. Unlike many other cough medications, benzonatate is not a cough syrup. Instead, it comes in liquid-filled gel capsules. There are several ways to treat a cough. If the cough is productive (it produces phlegm or mucus), it may be best to use an expectorant such as guaifenesin, which will help thin the mucus.
