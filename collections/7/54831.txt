RSV in Adults. RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is a virus that is very common in children, and can reinfect an adult who previously had an infection. The symptoms of RSV in adults are similar to those of the common cold, including runny nose, sore throat, cough, fever, and other symptoms. The adult RSV symptoms are usually less severe than the symptoms of RSV in children. The elderly are at increased risk for developing a serious RSV infection.
