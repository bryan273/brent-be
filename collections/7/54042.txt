A small carriage propelled by a steam turbine powered engine was apparently invented by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Belgian, in 1672 while in China. It is argued that this constitutes the first 'car' ever invented, but the design was only 65cm long, had no seats or pilot controls, and was intended as little more than a toy.
