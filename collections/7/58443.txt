Creedence Clearwater Revival History. In 1958, rock music had passed its infancy. It was more like a toddler. These days, every high school in America (and in most places around the world) has several rock bands slugging it to play parties and concerts, in 1958 rock was not reputable. Not many high schools had a rock band, let alone junior highs.
