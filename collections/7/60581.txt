Suppose we changed the example so that it costs $60 to advertise to the customer. Now the good's NRV will be $100-$20-$60=$20. In this year's income statement, since the NRV ($20) is less than the cost of the good ($25), the NRV will get recorded as the Cost of Ending Inventory.To do so, an inventory write down of $25-$20=$5 is done, and hence a decrease of $5 in this year's income statement.In the next year's income statement after the good was sold, this company will record a revenue of $100, Cost of Goods Sold of $20, and Cost of Completion and Disposal of $20+$60=$80.uppose we changed the example so that it costs $60 to advertise to the customer.
