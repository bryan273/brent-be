Meet KY3 Storm Team Meteorologist Brandon Beck. Brandon began his weather career with KY3 in 1996, a couple of months before he graduated from Evangel University. His first role was weekend weather, and tornado warnings were issued six out of the first nine weekends on the job. In 2000 legendary Ozarks weathercaster Tom Dye retired; Ron Hearst moved from morning weather to nights and Brandon moved from weekends to mornings.
