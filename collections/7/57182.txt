Nitroglycerin is used medically as a vasodilator to treat heart conditions, such as angina and heart failure. It is one of the oldest and most useful drugs for treating heart disease by shortening or even preventing attacks of angina. Nitroglycerin comes in forms of tablets, sprays or patches. Blood returning from the body in the veins must be pumped by the heart through the lungs and into the arteries against the high pressure in the arteries. In order to accomplish this work, the heart's muscle must produce and use energy (fuel).
