Periodization. Early history. Modern history. Recent attempts. Contemporary pedagogic periodization. bibliography. bibliography. Periodization attempts to impart significance to the passage of time in history by identifying and ordering chronological sequences (periods). As practiced by historians, it has a long and varied history; as a subject of study, it commands neither a formal body of knowledge nor systematic instruction. To the historian, although not to the archeologist or anthropologist, periodization serves no accepted theoretical function.
