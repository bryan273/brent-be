Remember, too, that babies of less than 6 months of age do not usually require ANY supplemental fluids. Breast milk or formula contains enough water to quench your baby’s thirst and also provide the full range of nutrients your little one needs. The exception may be if your baby requires a little water or juice to help ease constipation – but you should always speak to your doctor first.
