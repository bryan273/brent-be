Many florists use double faced tape or the newer Uglu adhesive to attach the flower stems to the bouquet handle. I like to use the floral clay because it secures firmly even wet flower stems, holding them exactly in place until I secure them with wire or BindIt tape. Press the strip of florist clay at the very top of the bouquet holder handle.
