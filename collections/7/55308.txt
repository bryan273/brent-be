Former 49ers coach Jim Tomsula is interviewing for the position of Saints DL coach. He had previously garnered some attention from Washington, but never had a formal interview. Tomsula was out of his element as a head coach but was successful during his eight-year run as the Niners' DL coach. Bill Johnson held that position for the Saints last year but was fired after the season and has already caught on with the Rams. Jan 20 - 4:09 PM.
