Legumes are one of my favorite ingredients and lentils are one of my favorite legumes. They keep well in the cupboard, cook quickly and there are dozens of ways to use them-in soups, salads, stews, chili or simply as a side dish. Lentils, like peas, garbanzos and peanuts, are legumes.You can think of them as a starch since they are mostly carbohydrate and protein with essentially no fat. They best part is that they contain tons of fiber with a half cup of cooked lentils coming in at around 8 grams.s a result they will cook more quickly than brown or French lentils. These are slightly smaller and not as plump as green lentils and have a milder flavor. In India yellow lentils are known as moong dal and red lentils known as masoor dal. You might also see the pink lentils labeled Egyptian lentils.
