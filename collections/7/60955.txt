After disbanding in 1969, during which time Winwood joined Blind Faith (2), Traffic reunited in 1970 to release the album John Barleycorn Must Die. The band's line-up varied from this point until they disbanded again in 1975, although a partial reunion, with Winwood and Capaldi, took place in 1994. In 2004, Traffic was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Steve Winwood's Traffic, Traffic Etc, Traffic, Etc.
