Flea Collar Safety. If your veterinarian approves the use of a flea collar, there are important safety considerations to keep in mind. Your kitten must be more than 12 weeks of age. Use a flea collar with a breakaway buckle so your kitten can free himself without choking if the collar gets caught on something.
