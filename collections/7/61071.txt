Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African American musical styles such as gospel, Jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, along with country music.
