However, many nonqualified contracts issued today permit the. commencement of payments to be deferred until age 90 or even later. See. PLR 200022003 (contract permitted deferral to as late as age 90). The. income tax consequences of a late annuity starting date, if any, are. uncertain. On the other hand, the IRS has suggested that such a contract. may not be an annuity.
