Lanark is a historic market town in the Clyde Valley and is one of the oldest royal burghs in Scotland. Lanark was granted its royal charter by King David I in the 12th century and two centuries prior to that it became home to the first Scottish Parliament. The town's St Nicholas Parish Church has what is believed to be one of the oldest church bells in the world.
