lateral angulation of the leg in relation to the thigh (exaggeration of the knee angle) is called genu valgum (knock-knee). Medial angulation of the leg in relation to thigh is a deformity called genu varum (bowleg). A valgus stress at the knee pushes it to create a knock-knee, testing the medial collateral ligament.
