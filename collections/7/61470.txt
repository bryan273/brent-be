Even if the Allies had exact copies of the 88mm, they would probably have failed to use it effectively. For more on this topic, I commend the following websites and forums. Source(s): http://wnet.suomi.net/kotisivu/harri.kaa...http://www.achtungpanzer.com/articles/88...nce the allies were aware there were many reasons to admire the 88mm Gun they began to devise an even better bigger gun, specifically the 105 MM L7 cannon.... No it never makes sense to copy an enemies gun it makes sense to improve upon it.
