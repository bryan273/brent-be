Rohypnol binds to the receptor sites for the neurotransmitter, Î³-aminobutyric acid. Rohypnol is a type of benzodiazepine, a class of drugs that depresses the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines interact with receptors on brain neurons that use the neurotransmitter called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). A GABA receptor also contains sites for binding other molecules such as benzodiazepines.
