However, my first choice for my patients is to floss, followed by waterpik, then brush. If you CAN floss, then do so. A waterpik is not a substitute for you. By the way, healthy gums will NOT bleed. If you are consistently getting bleeding when using floss or a waterpik you need to tell your dentist or hygienist. While you are there, be sure to demonstrate your flossing technique to your hygienist so she can “coach” you.
