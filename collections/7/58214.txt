The perception of consumers in supermarkets, organic shops and fair trade shops is as follows: buying a product certified/labelled by one concept includes automatically the other label/concept. But in reality not all organic products would fulfil fair trade criteria. On the other hand less than half of the fair trade food products are at the moment certified organic. The concept of standards/criteria is funded on a different basis: fair trade is more process oriented than organic.
