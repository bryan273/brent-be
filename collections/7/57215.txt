Electric cars wouldn't be practical until rechargeable lead-acid batteries were invented in 1859. By 1886, Karl Friedrich Benz of Germany had invented the first gasoline-powered car. It was a three-wheeled vehicle, which other engineers later improved by adding a fourth wheel and a more efficient engine.
