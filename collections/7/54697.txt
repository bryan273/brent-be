The energy of a photon depends on its wavelength: Where, E is the energy of the photon, c is the velocity of light, lambda (l) is the wavelength, and h is Planck's constant; one of the constants of nature. The important thing to remember is that: 1  A long wavelength photon has low energy. 2  A short wavelength photon has more energy.
