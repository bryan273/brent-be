A hinged patio door (typically with a single large pane of glass, or French-style with an overlay creating the look of multiple panes of glass) starts at about $400-$900 but can cost $1,000-$4,000 or more depending on size, materials, style and options like built-in blinds, more energy-efficient glass or side panels of fixed glass, For example, the Andersen 200 Series Hinged Inswing Patio Door costs about $840 in a single-panel configuration.
