Shavuot is 50 days after Passover (the 6th of Sivan) and the word Shavuot means “weeks” because it is 7 weeks after Passover. The Torah tells us that we celebrate this holiday because of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. In Exodus chapter 19 and 20 we are told that HaShem gave us the commandments.
