So don t open up every bottle of oil in your new sampler kit or in your box of essential oils. Spend only about 10-15 minutes on your new oils and study only a few. Quit and do a few more the next day or at the very least after several hours where your mind has time to reset your sense of smell. Describing what an essential oil smells like can be quite tricky. If you try to explain the smell of a particular essential oil to someone that has never smelled that odor before, your description can be very difficult to relate. Although most oils can be described by some common terms.
