A loss of lower esophageal sphincter tone can result in large amounts of gastric juice reflux into the esophagus. A delay in gastric emptying can increase the volume and pressure in the stomach until the lower esophageal sphincter is compromised, causing GERD. Chronic GERD may progress to Barrett's esophagus, which can culminate in esophageal adenocarcinoma.
