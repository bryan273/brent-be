Tape measure. Measure the height and width around the largest point of the package. The USPS uses inches for its package measurement. Therefore, you should take these measurements in inches. For example, assume the height of a package is 50 inches and the width around the largest point of the package is 40 inches. Make sure you measure all the way around the width of the largest point of the package.
