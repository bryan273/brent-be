Allergy or Intolerance. More persons actually have a food intolerance for tomatoes and not a full-blown tomato allergy. An intolerance for tomatoes usually creates gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea, cramps or vomiting. A protein found in tomatoes is generally what creates the allergic reaction by the bodyâ€™s immune system.
