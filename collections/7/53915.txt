This exceptionally clear calcite is known as Iceland Spar. It is an excellent example of the rhombohedral cleavage of calcite (three cleavage planes, none at right angles). Also, it shows how you can see double vision when you look through 2 of 3 sides of a calcite rhomb. Photo: Dept. of Physics, University of Naples. Like many minerals, calcite comes in a variety of colors.
