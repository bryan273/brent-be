Although the mean temperature for June and July is only 73 °F and 76 °F (23 °C and 24 °C) it is not uncommon for the temperature to reach 100 °F (38 °C) at least three concurrent days each week in these months, as it did in 1904 during the World Fair where the temperature in St. Louis, Missouri was 103 °F (39 °C).
