Typically, when we speak of radon, we are speaking of radon 222 which has an half life of 3.8 days. This means that if a volume of radon is sealed into a container and left on its own, half of the radon will decay into SLRDs and be gone in four days.adon and Health When radon decays, it too produces a decay chain, with its own daughters. During its decay, it releases a large atomic alpha particle and the atom is transmuted into polonium. An alpha particle is essentially an helium atom stripped of its electrons.
