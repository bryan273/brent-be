Male hormones are called androgens, and they include testosterone. All females produce androgens, but the levels normally remain low. Certain medical conditions can cause a woman to produce too many androgens, causing male-pattern hair growth and other unwanted male characteristics, such as a deep voice. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one common cause of hirsutism.
