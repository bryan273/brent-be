Step 1 â€” Set up the transect line for sampling. Working in groups of two or three, students choose a line for sampling in the study area. They extend the 10-metre rope between two points, starting in one kind of ecosystem and finishing in another.The rope can be secured with pegs at each end to minimise movement.im. In this activity, students use transects to collect detailed data about the variety of living things in the study area. A transect is a 10-metre-long straight line across the study area. At one-metre intervals, whatever living thing is under (or above) the tagged mark is recorded.
