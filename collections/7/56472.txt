CHARLES E. BOLES. 1  There is very little known about Charles E. Boles early life. We have collected a lot of information, much of it conflicting, but what we offer is as factual as we can find. 2  Charles E. Bowles was born in Norfolk County, England in 1829. At the age of two he migrated with his parents to Alexandria township, Jefferson County, in up-state New York (in 1831). The family homestead lay four miles north of Plessis Village, toward Alexandria Bay.
