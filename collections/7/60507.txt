Tryptophan is a precursor for 5-HTP, which is subsequently a precursor serotonin and melatonin. Therefore, tryptophan or 5-HTP may be consumed or supplemented to increase levels of both serotonin and melatonin in the body.ryptophan and 5-HTP can be converted into serotonin in the digestive tract but must transported to the brain where it is then synthesized into melatonin. The pineal gland in the brain switches on melatonin synthesis when it detects lower levels of light in the ambient environment.
