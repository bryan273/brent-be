LevoxylÂ® (levothyroxine sodium) is a thyroid medication approved for the treatment of an underactive thyroid. It is available by prescription only and comes in the form of a tablet that is taken once a day. There are many strengths of Levoxyl available (12 total), ranging from 25 mcg to 300 mcg. Since different people have varying degrees of hypothyroidism and respond to medications differently, there is no standard Levoxyl dosage. The drug is not a one-size-fits-all medication, and doses must be individualized for each person.
