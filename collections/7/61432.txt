Line the toaster oven tray with foil. Put a layer of onions and garlic on the foil, then lay the chicken on top. Put as many parts from a whole chicken that will fit into the tray without being packed too tightly. Lay the chicken parts skin-side up. Put any remaining pieces of onion and garlic between the chicken pieces.
