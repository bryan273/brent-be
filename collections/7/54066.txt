After 1791, the province of Quebec was split in two colonies, Upper Canada and Lower Canada. In Upper Canada, slavery was abolished sooner and in Lower Canada, it was abolished in 1833. Later, it was abolished in all the British Empire. Upper Canada was the terminus of the Underground Railroads, a circuit of tunnels for slaves to escape the United States.
