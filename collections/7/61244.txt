Some medicines can help the body make more platelets. Steroids (such as prednisone) or other medicines may be needed to suppress the immune system. An intravenous (IV) infusion of a substance made from human blood plasma (immunoglobulin) may be given. Sometimes you will need to have platelet transfusions. In rare cases, the spleen may need to be removed.
