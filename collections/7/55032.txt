The court will not. prevent a parent from seeing a child just because the parent has not made support. payments. MYTH: If the child is living with the mother, and the mother and father have never been. married, the mother has legal custody of the child and the father cannot take the. child. REALITY: Without a court order for custody, each parent has an equal right to have the child. live with her/him and to make decisions about the child.
