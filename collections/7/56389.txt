Dave Barry graduated from Haverford College in Pennsylvania in 1969; his first newspaper job was as a reporter for the West Chester (PA) Daily Local News. After he was hired by The Miami Herald and began his column in 1983, widespread syndication of his work made him one of America's most popular humor columnists.
