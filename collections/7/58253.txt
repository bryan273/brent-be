From the quote: ...if he flies in an Air Force jet, the plane is called Air Force One. Technically, Air Force One is the call sign of any Air Force aircraft carrying the President. In this case (this case being Michelle Obama's visit to my San Diego today) the President is not on board the plane, so, as we can infer from the quote, its call sign is not Air Force One.
