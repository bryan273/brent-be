Introduction to bivariate analysis. â€¢ When one measurement is made on each observation, univariate. analysis is applied. If more than one measurement is made on each observation, multivariate analysis is applied. In this section, we focus on bivariate analysis, where exactly two. measurements are made on each observation. The two measurements will be called X and Y . Since X and Y. are obtained for each observation, the data for one observation. is the pair (X,Y ).
