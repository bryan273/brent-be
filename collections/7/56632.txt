Me and you and you and me. No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be. The only one for me is you, and you for me. So happy together. I can't see me lovin' nobody but you. For all my life. When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue. For all my life. Me and you and you and me. No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be. The only one for me is you, and you for me. So happy together. I can't see me lovin' nobody but you.
