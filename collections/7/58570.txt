Deadline to file individual tax returns (Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ) for the year 2016 or to request an automatic extension (Form 4868). An extension provides an extra six months to file your return. Payment of the tax is still due by April 18. You can submit payment for tax along with the extension form.
