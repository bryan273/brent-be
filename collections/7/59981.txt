Wind Speed and Direction Note: The wind sensor is located only 5 feet above the roof and thus may give wind speed readings that are often 50% lower than what they really are. The anemometer is located on the eastern side (facing the ocean) of Ocean Trails, a 14 story condominium complex. When there is a wind out of the west, the wind direction and the speed respond to the turbulence in the wake of the building, giving readings from all directions.
