Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way, In a little while we’re going home; For the night will end in the everlasting day, In a little while we’re going home. Refrain. In a little while, in a little while, We shall cross the billow’s foam; We shall meet at last, When the stormy winds are past, In a little while we’re going home.
