Though there are some exceptions, in most cases, your employer is required to pay you overtime. The threshold for overtime pay is 40 hours per week. Some states, however, have separate labor laws that require overtime pay for employees who work more than a certain number of hours in a single day. California, for example, requires employers to pay overtime for any hours worked in excess of 8 hours in a single day. You can be forced to work overtime. In most cases, you can be required to work mandatory overtime – but your employer still has to pay you overtime if you’re a non-exempt employee.
