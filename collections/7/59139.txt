To make your own cake flour, sift together Â¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. The use of pastry or cake flour will make for a more tender cake. Since measurement is so important, spoon the flour into the measuring device and level off for greatest accuracy.
