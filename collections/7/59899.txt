Many of us are used to cooking potatoes with a cold start so they cook evenly, but I’ve found that this doesn’t apply to hard-boiled eggs. A hot start gives you an easier peel, and the eggs will still cook beautifully and evenly. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then gently lower the eggs into the water. I use a wire basket for this. Now that the eggs are in, lower the heat so that the water is at a gentle simmer. You don’t want a full rolling boil, just a gentle amount of bubbles. Cook for 13 minutes.
