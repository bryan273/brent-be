Single words for blue/green are also found in Mayan languages; for example in the Yukatek Maya language blue/green is yax. Tupian languages did not originally differ between the two colors, though they may now as a result of interference of Spanish (in the case of Guaran√≠) or Portuguese (in the case of Nheengatu).
