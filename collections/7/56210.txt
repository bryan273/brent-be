Ceiling function. In mathematics and computer science, the floor and ceiling functions map a real number to the largest previous or the smallest following integer, respectively. More precisely, floor(x) = is the largest integer not greater than x and ceiling(x) = is the smallest integer not less than x.loor and ceiling may be defined by the set equations. Since there is exactly one integer in a half-open interval of length one, for any real x there are unique integers m and n satisfying. Then and may also be taken as the definition of floor and ceiling.
