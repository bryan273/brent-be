There are two forms of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. Research has shown that soluble fiber lowers cholesterol, which can help prevent heart disease. Insoluble fiber is found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains.
