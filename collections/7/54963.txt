Dwarf mondo grass grows well under shady or sunny conditions. Many landscapers like to use this plant in patches between trees in a shady area because they handle lack of sunlight better than most grasses. It is also frequently used between stepping stones, to mark the border of a garden or pathway, or in flower beds.warf mondo grass is a miniature version of mondo grass that reaches a height of only about 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm). Once established, this ornamental plant will spread out to form a thick layer of grassy turf that is resistant to drought and pests and never needs to be mowed.
