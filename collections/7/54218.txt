The most obvious area of muscle building during bike rides is the lower body, more specifically the legs. Cyclists build the two main muscles located in the calf: soleus and gastrocnemius. The soleus helps to lift the heel and the gastrocnemius is the prominent part of the calf that allows riders to go.
