In The United States Lomotil is a federally controlled schedule V substance. Motofen (difenoxin/ atropine) is a prescription medication in The US and it is a federally controlled schedule IV substance (the same level as phenobarbital, Darvocet, Valium, and Tenuate). Just because a drug is for something like diarrhea does not mean it can't be abused.
