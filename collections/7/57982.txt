Anemia is when you do not have enough red blood cells. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which is needed to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. There are several common blood tests that may be used to diagnose anemia. A red blood cell count can measure the number of red blood cells that you have. Hemoglobin can also be measured. These two tests are included in a complete blood count or CBC. A CBC can also tell the size of the red blood cells. Once anemia is suspected by either a low hemoglobin or red blood cell count, other blood tests may be done to see what kind of anemia you have. By checking an iron level and ferritin, your doctor will be able to tell how much iron you have in your body.
