The sensation of post-nasal drip is not usually caused by an increased amount of mucus coming from your nose or sinuses, says Dr. Dolan. “It is more likely to be caused by the mucus becoming too thick or by irritation of your throat. In my experience, the three most common causes are allergy, gastric reflux, and medications that cause dryness.”. Here are some other common conditions that may cause post-nasal drip: 1  Cold or flu viruses. 2  Sinus infection.
