There are three measurable properties of wave motion: amplitude, wavelength, and frequency (the number of vibrations per second). The relation between the wavelength λ (Greek lambda) and frequency of a wave ν (Greek nu) is determined by the propagation velocity v, such that. $v=\nu \lambda$. For light, this equation becomes. $\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}$. where c is the speed of light, 2.998 x 10 m/s.
