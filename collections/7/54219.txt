Carry on. In cyclocross races, when you have to dismount and run with your bike, stand on its left side (opposite the sharp gears), pick it up, and slide your right arm through the triangle so the top tube rests on your right shoulder. Reach your right hand around the front and grab the bottom of the left handlebar.
