The Old Jew often spoke broken Hebrew with a heavy accent, while the sabra spoke the language as a mother tongue. Unlike the Old Jew who did not fight for his self-defense, the Sabra fought in the Jewish resistance movements, in the Palmach and after the establishment of Israel in the Israel Defense Forces.
