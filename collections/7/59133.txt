The weather in Northern Ireland during the Spring is mostly pleasant. Northern Ireland gets a fair amount of rain and it can be windy or cold at times. But you also get some glorious days, especially from April onwards. With nature in full bloom and the days getting longer, Spring is a good time to visit.
