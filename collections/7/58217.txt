Sugar can sweeten anyone's day! Fair Trade sugar increases wages and community development funds for struggling farmers. Sugar cane farmers are some of the most impoverished in the world as a result of fluctuating prices and difficulty accessing the U.S. market. By connecting directly to buyers, Fair Trade farmers are able to improve the lives of their families and the quality of their products. Add Fair Trade sweetness to your day, and bring a smile to the faces of farmers.
