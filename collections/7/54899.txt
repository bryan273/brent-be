If you delay receiving your Social Security until age 70, the monthly amount is 32 percent more than you would get at full retirement age. From a Social Security standpoint, you can start getting lower benefits as early as age 62, or you can delay retirement up to age 70 for your maximum monthly benefit amount. For example: Letâ€™s say your full retirement age for Social Security benefits is 66, and your monthly benefit at that age is $1,000.
