Justin just seems to know what’s up when it comes to making fragrances for girls. Being a Belieber, I of course checked out his first fragrance, Someday, and his second, Girlfriend, and I loved them both. But The Key takes the cake! His third fragrance was rumored to be his first for men, but I am so glad it wasn’t because girls definitely need The Key as part of their perfume collection.
