Corresponding obstetric sonography, postnatal imaging, and clinical/operative reports were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the fetal MRIs reviewed, 95 fetuses were included in our analysis; 23.2% (22/95) were suspected of having subependymal gray matter heterotopias on fetal MR imaging prospectively. However, only 50% (11/22) of these cases were confirmed on postnatal brain MR imaging.
