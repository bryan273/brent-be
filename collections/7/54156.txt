The Men's Olympic Marathon in London 12/8/12 may be the biggest crowd in the World ever for a one day event I would have thought. Of course there is no exact number, but I would have thought that the estimates that come out over the next few hours may well put it up there. (from colin harwood, 13 Aug 2012)
