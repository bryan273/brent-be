Hopefully we’ll also see the all-new Kiki soon when Hayley Erin takes over the role in February. In other casting news, Rebecca Budig, who played Greenlee Smythe on All My Children will come to “General Hospital” to play a “killer” new role. Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) will try to place peacemaker between Sonny and Michael, but Michael will not want to back down. When this flops, Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) will try and make peace between Sonny and Michael.
