India is a country that has potential to be clean, it has wealth and the people in power chose to do nothing about the problem. If you keep defending it and ignoring the problem things won’t get better. I hope it does because the people met and the friends that we made in India, don’t deserve to live in filthy streets.i Guys, I am an Indian and I can attest to the account of filthiness that you’ve given. One of the reasons that India is filthy is that people are lazy to the bone. Those lazy people (labeled as middle class) then employ desperate poor people for menial jobs.
