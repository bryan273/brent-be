Soil Acidity. Maple trees do not grow well in very alkaline soil with a pH over 7.3. The alkalinity of the soil inhibits the uptake of nutrients by the treesâ€™ roots, which causes iron chlorosis. In the wild, maple trees are found in soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.3, but the trees tolerate a soil acidic level down to 3.7.
