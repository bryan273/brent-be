History of the Procedure. Gamekeeper's thumb is a clinical instability of the first metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint caused by an insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the MCP of the thumb.amekeeper's thumb is caused by a valgus force that is directed on the MCP joint of the thumb and produces a failure of the UCL. Falls on an abducted thumb and the fall of a skier against a planted ski pole are common mechanisms. (For a discussion of the anatomy of the MCP joint and the UCL, see Relevant Anatomy.).
