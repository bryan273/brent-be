Deliverable, as an adjective, describes something that can be delivered, such as a product or service. For example, a software application might be said to be deliverable by a certain date. In an IT context, deliverable is more frequently used as a noun. For example, a software application might be listed as a project deliverable in a request for proposal ( RFP ).
