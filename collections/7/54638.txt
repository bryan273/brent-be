People love hearing about salt lamps when I give talks, and how crystalline salt helps to increase negative ions. The feeling generated by negative ions is one you find at the ocean, or in the high you experience in the midst of a big storm, or near a big waterfall. Positive ions, on the other hand, are full of pollution.
