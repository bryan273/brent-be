Overview of Protein Expression. Protein expression refers to the way in which proteins are synthesized, modified and regulated in living organisms. In protein research, the term can apply to either the object of study or the laboratory techniques required to manufacture proteins. This article focuses on the latter meaning of protein expression. However, in practical terms, recombinant protein production depends on using cellular machinery.
