No, it's conservative based on what I seen during my travels to Kangding. Apparently the PRC government encourages Tibetans being bilingual. At a family home in the middle of Tagong highland, I saw few educational posters of objects (food, tools, services, and etc) with labels in Tibetan and Chinese. I was surprised to see a dictionary of Tibetan, Chinese, and English laying on the floor.
