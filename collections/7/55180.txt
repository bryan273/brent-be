WE WANT TO TELL YOUR STORY. At NICA, we know that Infusion Centers are improving patient lives every day. We also know that every day patients are denied coverage and are unable to afford the medications they need. We are launching a storytelling campaign to promote the Infusion Center. We are looking for stories about patients and staff whose lives have been significantly impacted by the Infusion Center, and we need your help to find them.
