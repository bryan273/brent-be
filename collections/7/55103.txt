A. The FLSA generally requires overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. In a regular, 40 hour week situation, the FLSA threshold is thus 40 hours per week. Some government employees, and some medical employees, may have different thresholds. For FLSA purposes, only actual work time counts toward the overtime threshold.
