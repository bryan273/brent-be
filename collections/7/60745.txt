Roots act like sponges to absorb soil moisture. Just as humans digest food for energy, plants use a number of absorption techniques to get the nutrients and moisture necessary for vigorous growth. As roots dive into the soil, they encounter air, water and nutrient reserves.In contrast, photosynthesizing leaves discover sunlight and air as they rise into the sky.hese hairs absorb water and soluble nutrients for plant success. However, some critical nutrients, like phosphorus, are not readily absorbed by plant root hairs. Soil micro-organisms, such as earthworms, consume the surrounding elements and expel castings rich in soluble elements.
