Then you know a malingerer. The verb malinger comes from the French word malingre, meaning sickly, and one who malingers feigns illness. In its earliest uses in the 19th century, malinger usually referred to a soldier or sailor pretending to be sick or insane to shirk duty. Later, psychologists began using malingering as a clinical term to describe the feigning of illness in avoidance of a duty or for personal gain.
