But while we're usually pretty familiar with our own arteries and veins, we tend to tune out when it comes to plant vessels. A vascular system is what distributes water and nutrients to different parts of a plant. Vascular systems are made up of xylem and phloem, or vascular tissue, which we'll get into soon. Not all plants have vascular tissue-algae don't need it, since they're immersed in their source of nutrition and hydration.
