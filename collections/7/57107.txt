The only president to ever serve on the Supreme Court was William Howard Taft. President Warren G. Harding appointed him to be Chief Justice in 1921. He served in that position until he retired in 1930. As Chief Justice, Taft was able to make changes giving the court more control over its docket. He also argued for the construction of a separate building for the Supreme Court.
