The Germans had great trouble with the first Panthers (a lose copy of the T-34) because they jumped too far in design-it was highly unreliable. The Tiger was too heavy. Hitler was threatening to disband the Panther and use the turrets in defence positions because of the initial poor performance.he Tiger was designed and built around the large 88mm gun, hence why it was so heavy. The Tiger 2, with along barrel 88mm gun was a joke was it could not use rail cars and most bridge would collapse under it.
