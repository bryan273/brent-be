Radon is a radioactive element formed by the disintegration of radium. It is the heaviest of the noble gases, and therefore builds up in the lowest levels of the house. It occurs naturally, especially in areas over granite. If vented to the outdoors, where it can be scattered by the wind, it is relatively harmless.omebuyers often request radon tests, sometimes to be paid by the seller. The test may be required as part of the purchase contract to protect the homebuyer. Sometimes a conflict of interest can arise, where the team that would do the remediation is also the team that does the testing.
