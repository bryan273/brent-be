Shavuot is on the 6th day of Sivan (of the Jewish lunar calendar). Within Israel, the holiday is celebrated for 1 day. Outside of Israel, the holiday is celebrated for 2 days (that is, on the 6th and 7th days of the month of Sivan). Although it falls out differently every year on the solar, secular calendar, in 2010, it falls out on the 19th (and 20th) of May.
