Got to get every penny out of my Â£5 Superstar pads Worth replacing early if you've got a big ride or event on though of course. (remember just because you've taken a set of pads out doesn't mean they have to go in the bin, I've got about 4 sets of worn down spares that can go back in later if I run out.)
