A research study performed by the Institute of Pharmacology at Karl-Franzens-University of Graz in Austria confirmed the presence of several chemicals in black seeds that act as antioxidants in the human body. Many other scientific studies state that administration of black seeds offer several medicinal benefits due to the presence of antioxidants. It should be noted that black seeds are considered an herbal, alternative treatment so a consultation with a physician is advised prior to the administration of black seeds for treatment of any medical condition.
