Don't be lost in confusion over what time stores close if you need to shop. Driving to a store only to figure out it has closed is a major let down, especially if you've driven far. To fix this problem, make sure you're aware of closing times before you head to the store. Some closing hours may surprise you. Most are open 24/7.
