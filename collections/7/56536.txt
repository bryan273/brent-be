Even the term Kara does not mean empty in the deeper sense, and surely not in the context of the compound term Karate. In the deeper sense, the kanji also means expansion or sky. In this sense the art of Karate can mean that it is as unlimited as the expansion - sky's the limit. When you consider that on the surface the techniques look like they are punches, blocks, kicks, stepping to and fro, turning, you can say it is empty hand.
