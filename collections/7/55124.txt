Also featured prominently on the EPA’s website is a 2005 statement from the Surgeon General that states, “Indoor radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States… It’s important to know that this threat is completely preventable.”.hile the EPA crows that radon is the second-leading cause of cancer and that thousands die each year from radon, it is virtually impossible to tell whether radon or exposure to tobacco caused lung cancer! And from these fabrications sprung countless regulations, bureaucrats, businesses, inspectors and agencies.
