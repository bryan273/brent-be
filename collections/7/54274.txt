The NA LCS is locked in and ready to touchdown in Canada this Summer. We can’t wait for some epic Bo5 battles (worthy of Silver Scrapes) to determine the NA LCS Summer Split champions and who’ll represent North America at Worlds 2016. The EU LCS will share where they’re going for Summer Finals in the coming weeks. Bear Schmiedicker, yes, Bear is his real name, is one of the NA LCS Leads. Besides leading the NA LCS team, he works with a group that is focused on pro player career/personal development. He previously led and grew the NA Player Support team at Riot and has had a long history and passion for Esports.
