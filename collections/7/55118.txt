The ratio of the activity of the SLRDs to the activity of the radon gas is called the Equilibration Ratio (ER). Equilibrium usually occurs in about three to four hours. When an individual receives a dose of one WL in 170 hours (a miner's month), the exposure then becomes called a working level month or WLM.adon and Health When radon decays, it too produces a decay chain, with its own daughters. During its decay, it releases a large atomic alpha particle and the atom is transmuted into polonium. An alpha particle is essentially an helium atom stripped of its electrons.
