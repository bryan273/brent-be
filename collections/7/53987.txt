Symptoms of Foodborne Illness. 1  Common symptoms of foodborne illness are diarrhea and/or vomiting, typically lasting 1 to 7 days. 2  What some people call the “stomach flu” may actually be a foodborne illness caused by a pathogen (i.e., virus, bacteria, or parasite) in contaminated food or drink. The incubation period (the time between exposure to the pathogen and onset of symptoms) can range from several hours to 1 week.
