Threads of natural, synthetic, or metallic material intended to sew a wound or incision together (i.e., approximate the edges and provide a method for wound closure). Sutures are either absorbable (e.g., surgical gut, polyglicolic acid) or nonabsorbable (e.g., silk, nylon, polypropylene, stainless steel).
