A transect is a defined area in which sample population counts of plants and animals can be taken. The defined area has to be large enough to truly characterize the biotic and abiotic factors of the ecosystem. The size of a transect is determined by the biotic factors in the area chosen to investigate. transect is a defined area in which sample population counts of plants and animals can be taken.
