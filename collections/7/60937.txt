There are many more people who have Dodge ancestry which we have no yet been able to connect to their ancient ancestors. Two brothers, William and Richard, came to America in 1629 and 1638, respectively, from Somerset County, England. Their father was John Dodge of Middle Chinnock. One brother, Michael, stayed in England. Today, there are well over 35,000 descendents of William and Richard living in the United States that we know of.
