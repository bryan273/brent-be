Keep in Mind Ginger ale only has a little bit of real ginger, so have your child sip ginger tea about 30 minutes before getting into the car: Add a teaspoon of shredded fresh ginger to 4 ounces of boiling water and let it steep for five minutes. Serve it to your child warm or iced, and sweeten it with honey.
