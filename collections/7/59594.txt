China – Birthplace of Skiing. February 28, 2011. At last week’s ISPO-China I was privileged to speak at the Asian Pacific Snow Conference, but the highlight of my the day was listening to and meeting Mr. Shan Zhaojian, a Chinese ski historian. I would describe Mr. Zhaojian as much more than just a historian.
