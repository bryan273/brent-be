Leave it open to dry and the smell should be gone. If there is still a slight smell try this, when the purse is completly dry pour some baking soda in it , close it up and let it sit for 24-48 hours. Dump powder out...you might have to use a damp cloth to wipe out any residue. Leave it open to dry. Your smell should be gone after that. Good luck, W. Q.
