The tonsils are tissues located in the back of your throat. These structures are part of your lymphatic system, which helps remove toxins from the body. Normal tonsils are similar in color to your throat, but they can develop white areas if you have tonsillitis. Tonsillitis is simply inflammation of the tonsils. They may be swollen and cause a number of symptoms, including a sore throat, painful swallowing, a stiff neck, headache and a scratchy voice.
