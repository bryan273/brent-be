Since serotonin is a precursor for melatonin, serotonin deficiencies can lead to sleep disorders and insomnia. Insomnia is a condition where sleep is disturbed through trouble getting to sleep, trouble staying sleep and waking up too early in the morning.ryptophan and 5-HTP can be converted into serotonin in the digestive tract but must transported to the brain where it is then synthesized into melatonin. The pineal gland in the brain switches on melatonin synthesis when it detects lower levels of light in the ambient environment.
