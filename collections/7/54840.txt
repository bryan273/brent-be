Accrued expenses (also called accrued liabilities) represent unpaid and unrecorded costs incurred in the current period. Accrued expenses should be recognized before cash is paid and should be reported in the income statement in the period they are incurred, and not in the period they are settled (e.g. paid with cash). Accrued expenses or liabilities are shown under the current liabilities in the balance sheet.
