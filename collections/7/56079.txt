Colonialisms in T&T. As we know, Trinidad was a Spanish colony until 1797. It was never a French colonyyet France has greatly influenced its history and culture. This happened, of course, because of the influx of French immigrants in the late 1700s, as a result of the Cedula of Population (1783) inviting foreign Catholics to settle in Trinidad.
