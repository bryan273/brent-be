Causes and Symptoms of Norovirus Infection. Noroviruses are members of a group of viruses called caliciviruses, known previously as “Norwalk-like viruses.”. This infection is often mistakenly referred to as the “stomach flu”, but noroviruses are not related to the flu (influenza), which is a respiratory illness caused by influenza virus. Norovirus is also sometimes called viral gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and calicivirus.
