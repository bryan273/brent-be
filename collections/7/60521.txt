If the jaw is damaged during tooth extraction, full recovery may take up to six months. Once you have undergone the surgical extraction procedure, there are several steps to take to ensure proper healing and recovery from the procedure. During the first 24 hours after wisdom teeth removal, you can expect some bleeding. To control bleeding, a moist, clean piece of gauze can be placed over the extraction site. Biting pressure applied for 45 minutes should stop the bleeding.
