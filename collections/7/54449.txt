The less you handle your ground meat, the better. Mushing it causes the proteins to get worked up, and that makes your burgers less tender. So for the best burgers, don’t do ANYTHING to it before you shape the meat it into patties. Don’t dump it in a bowl to add seasoning — not even salt and pepper — and mix it around.
