Serotonin and melatonin are both neurotransmitters derived from the essential amino acid tryptophan, found in protein. These brain messengers are important for regulating our sleep cycles and our moods.ryptophan and 5-HTP can be converted into serotonin in the digestive tract but must transported to the brain where it is then synthesized into melatonin. The pineal gland in the brain switches on melatonin synthesis when it detects lower levels of light in the ambient environment.
