The rules on refunds. For all online purchases made from a trader on or after 13 June 2014, the Consumer Contracts Regulations apply. Traders selling at a distance, including business traders on Ebay, can withhold a refund if you haven't returned the goods. This is unless you have provided proof of postage.
