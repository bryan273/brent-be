The most common cause of frequent sneezing is exposure to small particles in the air that provoke the body's natural defense against such things getting into the lungs. If there is a lot of smoke, dust, or other debris in the air then this may be the cause. The other very common cause of frequent sneezing is allergies. Allergies are an inappropriate reaction of the body to common environmental exposures, such as pets, pollen, and mold. The nasal passages become swollen and irritated and sneezing results. Some minor cases of allergies can be managed with over the counter antihistamines or with irrigation of the nose with saline spray.
