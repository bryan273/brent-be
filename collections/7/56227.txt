Rated 4.0 out of 5.0 by Ranger Helpful Associates Compared with other home improvement stores in the area, I usually find associates floating around in the Hazlet Home Depot. On weekend I was looking in the area of toilets and overwhelmed by choices. An associate happened by and asked if I needed assistance.
