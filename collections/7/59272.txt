People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesiaâ€”the inability to form and retain new memories. In rodents, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampus respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment.
