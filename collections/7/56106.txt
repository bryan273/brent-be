A lot of the electricity that we use in Tennessee comes from rivers. But rivers were even more important to our ancestors than they are to us. Rivers used to be the main way to get from one place to another and move goods from one place to another.Intersections of rivers, and landmarks along rivers, were important meeting places.he three most important river systems in Tennessee are the Mississippi, the Tennessee and the Cumberland. However, in some ways, they are all part of the same system. Both the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers eventually flow north into the Ohio River, which in turn flows into the Mississippi.
