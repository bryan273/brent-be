If we go by the official list of dangerous sharks (e.g. from the International Shark Attack File ISAF, an institution which analyzes and collects reports on shark attacks) the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) ranks first, followed by the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).
