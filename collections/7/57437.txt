In the understanding of the Democracy Barometer project, democracy rests on three principles: freedom, control and equality. Freedom refers to the absence of heteronomy, and freedom rights are above all rights which protect an individual from infringements by the state. Historically, the most important of these rights under a secure rule of law have become one of the minimal conditions for democratic regimes.
