Door prices vary far more than for most home improvement purchases, and consumers may be quoted widely different prices for the same brand and model door from different retailers. Sliding glass doors (typically one fixed panel, one sliding; sometimes called gliding or bypass doors) typically cost $300-$800 for a basic 5'-6' wide set, or $600 -$2,000 with installation.
