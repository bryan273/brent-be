If the borrower just used the reverse mortgage proceeds to pay off the original mortgage, after ten years the reverse mortgage balance, including fees and interests, would be around $135,000. If on the other hand, you want to establish a line of credit or receive monthly income from the reverse mortgage, then you will want to have as much equity available as possible. For example, take the 65-year-old with the $300,000 home.
