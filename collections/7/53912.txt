The properties of minerals include crystal shape (habit), luster, color, streak, tenacity, hardness, cleavage, fracture, and density or specific gravity. in addition, a number of special physical and chemical properties (taste, smell, eleasticity, feel, magnetism, double refraction, and chemical reaction to hydrochloric acid) are useful in identifying certain minerals. each mineral has a unique set of properties that can be used for identification
