If you think that having good parts of India makes it ok that there are such horribly filthy parts, then you are part of the problem. You shouldn’t be proud that the rich live perfect lives and that it is expensive, you should be working to bring the standards of others.i Guys, I am an Indian and I can attest to the account of filthiness that you’ve given. One of the reasons that India is filthy is that people are lazy to the bone. Those lazy people (labeled as middle class) then employ desperate poor people for menial jobs.
