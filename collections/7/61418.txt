The Nugent Sand Co. has a proud history that is tied to Muskegon’s economic history. The site – which in total is about 500 acres, including the Jackson-Merkey Contractors property along the West Sherman Boulevard on the north end – began producing sand for industrial purposes in what was then Norton Township in 1912.
