When in doubt, cite it. Use proper citation format. When using direct quotations of sources include in the citation the author's last name (no need to include first name), year, and page number (APA, 6th ed., pp. 170-171). For direct quotations of online sources without a page number, insert the paragraph number (see APA, 6th ed., pp. 171-172).
