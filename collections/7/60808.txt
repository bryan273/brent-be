Ruffin and Kendricks also joined Hall and Oates at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. In 1989, Ruffin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with five other Temptations. Just two years later, David Ruffin, at 50 years of age, would collapse in a Philadelphia crack house. Hours later he was dropped off in front of a hospital, where he died of a drug overdose.
