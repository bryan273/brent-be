Since your name seems Indian, I'll also mention a common Indian-English idiosyncrasy that may clear up matters for you. There is a tendency in Indian speech to use could for can, and would for will.n the first situation, we use can with a meaning of ability. For example, I think I can lift the box means that the speaker thinks that she/he is able to lift the box. The past tense form of the sentence is I thought I could lift the box.
