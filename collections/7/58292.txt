Unlike subependymal hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis, which are isointense to myelinated white matter and can also be seen in a subependymal/periventricular location, heterotopias are isointense to gray matter and do not enhance. Subcortical heterotopias differ from periventricular heterotopias in that these nodular masses develop in the white matter as swirling, irregular, curvilinear areas of ectopic gray matter .
