Muffins: $0.60 / $2.00 = 30%. If Moe's sells only one unit of product, as is the case with Andy, Moe's should 'push' the product with the highest contribution margin per unit to generate the highest profit.Moe's will generate $0.60 on one muffin compared to $0.55 on one donut, so the muffin should be 'pushed' to Andy.f the $2 that Barney plans to spend, Moe's should push donuts because out of each $2 of revenue, the sale will generate $1.10 of profit (55% times $2). The sale of $2 of muffins will generate only $0.60 of profit (30% times $2).
