These proteins are commonly found in mammalian milk, making up about 80% of the proteins in cow milk and between 20% and 45% of the proteins in human milk. If you add acid to milk you will start to precipitate out the casein protein dissolved in milk. This is the “isoelectric point” [1] of the casein.
