Q: What is Towing Capacity? Towing capacity refers to the maximum weight your vehicle is able to pull while towing -- i.e. the weight of a trailer, a boat, or another vehicle that you plan to tow. Although towing typically involves pulling weight in a trailer behind a vehicle on the road, towing can involve tractors and waterborne vessels.
