Kangaroo Pet Pump Alarms When your feeding is complete or if the pump senses a potential problem, it will display a message on the front panel of the pump and sound an alarm to inform you of the change. Press the blue “START/ HOLD” button to silence the alarm and stop the pump while you make the necessary adjustments.
