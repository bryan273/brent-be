Leeks are root vegetables that look quite similar to onions, to which they are related. Their flavor is onion-like but much milder. People who avoid this vegetable because they don't like onions should try them â€” their flavor is mellow and not overpowering, and many onion-haters enjoy them. Unlike onions, leeks don't form much of a bulb on the end of the root. Instead, they remain cylindrical, with perhaps a slight bulge at the end. The part of that is under ground remains tender and white, while the part exposed to the sunlight becomes tough and fibrous and not very good for eating.
