A quilt is a thick quilted blanket/comforter, in various patterns with quilting (stitching) throughout the quilt, securing the top layer, the batting (the stuffing) and the bottom layer together in decorative shapes. Many of the patterns are generations old, handed down from mother to daughter over the years.
