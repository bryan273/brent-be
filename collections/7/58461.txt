That depends on the baby...but eyes could stay blue. Blue is a recessive eye color and mom and dad could both have a recessive blue eye gene that was given to baby. my dd is almost 3months and her eyes are a beautiful blue like her daddy's eyes. Mine are brown and she is forming a strawberry blonde and/or red color. I wonder which one she will have as hair color. I am auburn with brown hair and my husband's is blonde/brown/red hair (dont ask) with blueish-hazel eyes.
