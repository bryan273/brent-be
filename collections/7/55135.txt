To find the ideal BPM for your running mix, run2rhythm, a site that sells running mixes, advises you perform this test: 1. Run for 15 minutes at a pace you are comfortable with. 2. If you are starting out this will be slower than if you are a conditioned runner. 3. During that run count your steps for 1 minute.
