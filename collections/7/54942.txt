Fifteen-man rugby had previously been an Olympic sport, debuting in Paris in 1900, but made its final appearance in the 1924 Games (in Paris, coincidentally).ormat. Golfâ€™s Olympic format proposed for the 2016 games is an individual-based competition. The qualified golfers will play 72 holes of stroke-play on several top-level golf courses (TBD) throughout Brazil.
