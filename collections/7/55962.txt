If plants are in a frost-free area, dig by mid-November. Cut the stalk to 4–6″ tall, rinse off the soil, and allow the clump to air dry under cover for 24 hours. Line cardboard boxes or terra-cotta pots with newspaper and layer tubers with barely moist sawdust, sand, or peat. Do not store in plastic.
