With a Speech check of 50, you can convince Neil to assist you in killing Tabitha. From Neil's shack you will have to make your way up the road towards Black Mountain. There is a long way where you will fight against three patrols and checkpoints of super mutants or nightkin. If you choose to take the normal path up the road, the 3rd Patrol of super mutants will include one nightkin.
