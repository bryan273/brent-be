Talk to the children about the different types of plants there, and how they are different to the ones grown at home. Talk about exotic plants, and how we can eat the produce of some plants, such as tomatoes. Ask the children what the plants need to grow, and how we can look after plants.nother great book is The Tiny Seed, by Eric Carle. Discuss what experiences the children have had with growing things, including large plants such as trees, and smaller plants such as daisies or buttercups. Talk about the plants and flowers in the school playground, and in childrenâ€™s gardens.
