Net realizable value is generally equal to the selling price of the inventory goods less the selling costs (completion and disposal).It is expected sales price less selling costs (e.g. repair and disposal costs).In formula:uppose we changed the example so that it costs $60 to advertise to the customer. Now the good's NRV will be $100-$20-$60=$20. In this year's income statement, since the NRV ($20) is less than the cost of the good ($25), the NRV will get recorded as the Cost of Ending Inventory.
