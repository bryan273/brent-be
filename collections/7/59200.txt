CBD and THC work very similarly in terms of time and often dosage, assuming you're consuming cannabis or tincture or edibles made with them, because they're both cannabinoids. So assuming you smoke or vape high CBD cannabis, you'll feel the effects more or less instantly although the full effect will take 10 minutes or so and last for 2 to 3 hours. And edibles will take 30 to 120 minutes usually, depending on what else you eat, and last for 4 to 6 hours. Pure CBD will give no actual high whatsoever.
