What is Laser Therapy? Laser therapies are medical treatments that use focused light. Laser light is a very special kind of light. Unlike most light sources, it is tuned to very specific wavelengths. This allows it to be focused into powerful beams. Laser light is so intense it can be used to shape diamonds or cut steel. In medicine, lasers offer surgeons the ability to work very precisely.
