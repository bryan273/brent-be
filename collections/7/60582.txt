The cost is still $50, and the cost to prepare it for sale is $20, so the net realizable value is $45 ($115 market value - $50 cost - $20 completion cost). Since the net realizable value of $45 is lower than the cost of $50, you should record a loss of $5 on the inventory item, thereby reducing its recorded cost to $45.ince the cost of $50 is lower than the net realizable value of $60, you continue to record the inventory item at its $50 cost. In the following year, the market value of the green widget declines to $115.
