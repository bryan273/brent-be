Keeping a Bichon's face clean and trimmed is important for health as well as looks. Mucus and discharge from the eyes tend to accumulate in the hair that grows around the eyes, and eye problems can result if you don't clean the area regularly. Tearstains are common, as a result of eye problems or even food allergies.
