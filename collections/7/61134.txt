Skier's thumb, also known as Gamekeeper's thumb, is an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), which is located in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint where the thumb meets the hand. The purpose of the UCL is to keep the thumb stable in order to pinch objects.kier's thumb got its name because this injury frequently happens during skiing accidents during which a person falls and doesn't let go of the ski pole. The thumb is jerked away from the index finger, stretching or even completely tearing the ulnar collateral ligament.
