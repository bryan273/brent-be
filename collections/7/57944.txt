Symptoms That Might Arise After a Minor Car Accident. Small fender benders do not usually cause serious injury. But any car accident can cause minor injuries. If you get into a minor accident, you might get headaches; neck, back, or shoulder pain or stiffness; or muscle or ligament strains and sprains. You may feel these symptoms immediately after the accident, but it is not uncommon for a person who has been in a car accident to not have symptoms for a day or two.
