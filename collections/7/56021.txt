At the 3' end of the tRNA molecule, opposite the anticodon, extends a three nucleotide acceptor site that includes a free -OH group. A specific tRNA binds to a specific amino acid through its acceptor stem. The cloverleaf structure shown above is actually a two dimensional simplification of the actual tRNA structure.
