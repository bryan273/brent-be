When the IRS places a tax levy on someone, it seizes property, garnishes wages and removes money from one’s bank account. This usually occurs because the person has ignored the IRS’s attempt to contact the person about debt. The debtor can call the main phone number to the IRS, which is 1-800-829-1040.
