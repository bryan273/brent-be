Saline nasal sprays can be purchased over the counter or made at home. To make a saline solution, boil 1 cup of water and let it cool. Then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Do not blow your nose for five to seven days after surgery, unless your doctor says you may. Do not insert anything into your nose. If you must sneeze, open your mouth and sneeze naturally. If you have nasal packing, your doctor may remove it several hours after surgery or up to seven days after surgery.
