Ask Tami: “Melody Sounds like the Imperial March”. my name is Mikayla and I keep hearing this song, but I never can figure out what it’s called or who its by. I can’t even really understand what the guy’s saying in most of the song. I last heard it on Saturday August 28, 2010 around 2:00-2:30 pm. The melody sounds like the Imperial March form Star Wars. I know, I make odd connections! Anyway , if you could help me, that would be great!
