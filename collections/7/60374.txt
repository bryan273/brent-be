With a twist-tie or an orchid clip (those little hair-clip things) fasten a small amount of moist sphagnum moss over the cut. Essentially, you are creating a small, exposed, air layer. This method can actually be used at each 'node' along the length of the stem. Along the stem there are small leaflets that grow. You can use a sterile scalpel to cut these leaves from the stem, and treat them in the same way.
