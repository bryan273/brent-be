Due to the varying survival rates for different types of cancer, the most common causes of death from cancer are not always the most common types of cancer. For instance, although lung and bronchus cancer causes the greatest number of deaths, breast cancer is more commonly diagnosed among females. In 2006, invasive breast cancer occurred among 119.3 per 100,000 females, whereas lung and bronchus cancer occurred in only 55.0 per 100,000.
