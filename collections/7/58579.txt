Data CDs, on the other hand, hold anything. They’re just another media on which you can store files from your computer. The format of a data CD is even similar to the format of your computer’s hard disk. It has a file system, directories, folders and files. But your car stereo knows nothing about file systems, folders and the like. All it knows is how to stream that raw audio data off of an audio format CD. While your computer can do that it too, it’s also a general-purpose device that understands the format of a data CD. But that’s not the only difference. Remember that I said that an audio CD is uncompressed.
