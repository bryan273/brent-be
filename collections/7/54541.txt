Buyers. Homes for sale ‘by owner’ are often the best value in any neighborhood. That is because owners have maximum negotiating flexibility, especially when they don’t have a listing agent’s commission soaking up 3% or more of the sale price. Of course, we encourage ‘by owner’ sellers to cover all or part of the buyer’s agent commission, so there’s still no cost to you.
