If a rare recessive deleterious allele has a frequency of q=0.1 in a random-mating population, the proportion of individuals homozygous for the deleterious allele is q 2 =0.01. In completely inbred population (F=1), the proportion of individuals homozygous for the deleterious allele is q=0.1. So there are 10 times as many individuals expressing the deleterious phenotype in a completely inbred population. In humans, the most common type of close inbreeding is between first cousins (F=1/16).
