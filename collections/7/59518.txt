Normal value ranges for vitamin B12 vary slightly among different laboratories and can range anywhere between 200 to 900 pg/mL. The general consensus is values less than 200 pg/mL constitute a B12 deficiency.ynthetic B12 found in supplements and fortified foods appears to be the best form. Though naturally occurring B12 is present in protein foods of animal origin, it may not be equal in its effectiveness in raising serum B12 levels.
