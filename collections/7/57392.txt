pool deck working with swimmers! Do not attempt to contact a coach during meets or practices through any of these methods. Your swimmer’s group coach is the person that you should contact for all practice and meet-related questions. Please ask your coach how he or she wants to receive communication from you. For most coaches, e-mail is the preferred method of communication, followed by phone calls and/or texts. The email addresses for every group’s coach can be found under the Coaches section of our team website.
