[edit on Wikidata] Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a form of alternative medicine that uses low-level (low-power) lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Whereas high-power lasers used in laser medicine destroy or cut tissue, low-power lasers are claimed to stimulate it and to encourage the cells to function. LLLT is integrated with mainstream medicine with ongoing research to determine where there is a demonstrable effect.
