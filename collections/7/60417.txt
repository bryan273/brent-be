The rate of decay of 14 C is such that half of an amount will convert back to 14 N in 5,730 years (plus or minus 40 years). This is the “half-life.” So, in two half-lives, or 11,460 years, only one-quarter of that in living organisms at present, then it has a theoretical age of 11,460 years. Anything over about 50,000 years old, should theoretically have no detectable 14 C left. That is why radiocarbon dating cannot give millions of years.
