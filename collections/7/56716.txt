Radial, ulnar, or radial and ulnar osteotomy is a technique often needed to treat abnormalities of the canine forelimb. Osteotomy is necessary to correct malunions and forelimb deviations resulting from growth plate abnormalities. The following material is taken, with minor modifications, from Riser and Shirer (1965).ISTAL LATERAL RADIAL PHYSEAL GROWTH DISTURBANCES. Premature closure of the distal lateral radial physis can result in severe developmental deformities of the involved forelimb. Recognition of the problem early in its course is necessary to minimize valgus deformity and secondary osteoarthritis of the elbow and carpus.
