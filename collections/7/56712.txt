Distal radial growth plate injury and positive ulnar variance have also been reported in this population. HYPOTHESIS: There is a relationship between wrist pain, radiographic findings of distal radial growth plate injury, and ulnar variance in skeletally immature young gymnasts.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.lnar variance was not associated with wrist pain or radiographic injury of the distal radial physis. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic findings of distal radial physeal injury are associated with wrist pain among young nonelite gymnasts.
