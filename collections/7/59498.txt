Glycolysis literally means splitting sugars.. Glucose, a six carbon sugar, is split into two molecules of a three carbon sugar. Glycolysis takes place in the cell's cytoplasm. In the process, two molecules of ATP, two molecules of pyruvic acid and two high energy electron carrying molecules of NADH are produced.n the presence of oxygen, glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, glycolysis allows cells to make small amounts of ATP.
