My granddaughters 15, 12, 8 were in O,ld Orchard Beach for a few days girls time and I bought 2 day passes for them for this amusement center - great choice for evening fun...Lots to do for all ages and fireworks one evening were wonderful... It's clean and everything appears to be well maintained...
