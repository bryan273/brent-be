Vanity plates come with an initial order cost and an additional renewal cost over and above the usual fees for vehicle registration. If you want to upgrade from your standard California car registration plates to vanity plates you can do so online, using your credit card to place the order. You may also apply for a specialized plate by submitting a request form with a money order or a check.
