The catch is that the audio CD is uncompressed. While you might have been able to put seven or eight hours of MP3s onto a single data CD before, youâ€™re out of luck with an audio CD. These contain only about 70 minutes or so. It may take several audio CDs to hold what you might currently have on a single data CD.
