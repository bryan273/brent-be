Nothing special, it makes a diffuse, shimmery light due the refraction on the salt crystals, depending on what light bulb or whatever you install inside. I must agree that for a bedroom, a salt lamp is something romantic, but as to the healing purposes of sodium chloride, be it from the Himalayans or not, I have my doubts. One advantage it has, if it is genuine: You can scrape off some crystals with a knife and put them on your breakfast egg.
