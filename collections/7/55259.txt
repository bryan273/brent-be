Static NAT with DHCP Client/ Failover router. I convinced the Call Center to buy a new router for their main and replace the Netgear with the 3825. We use the 3825 for Failover only. Also Nat overload for the whole inside address range.. The backup router is a DHCP client and the outside WAN ip changes from time to time. It's on a network with a /192 mask. We cannot get a static ip for the back up.
