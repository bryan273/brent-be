Justified And Ancient by The KLF. One line in this song is Make mine a 99, and the record comes under a few different codes, including CHOC-ICE or KLF99. A '99 is an ice cream with a flake in it (Flake'99). To promote this record The KLF hijacked an ice cream van in Liverpool and gave out free 99s around Liverpool.
