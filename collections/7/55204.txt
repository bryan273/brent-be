Use a rubber mallet to deliver two or three heavy blows to the protruding paddle on the back of the baffle, driving it toward the rear of the drum until it breaks loose. Once the baffle is dislodged, lift it out, together with any small bits of broken retaining tabs or clips left in the bottom of the drum.
