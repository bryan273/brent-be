Lightening 101. When people talk about your baby dropping, they’re actually referring to a term called lightening. Lightening is one of the major signs that labor is approaching. It happens when the baby's head literally drops lower into your pelvis, becoming engaged within your pubic bones. This starts baby’s descent down and out into the world. Lightening can start as early as a few weeks before labor actually begins. But for some women, it happens only a few hours before labor starts.
