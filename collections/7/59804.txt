I love going here with my kids. Just dont go in the evening to watch a grown up movie, like 50 Shades Darker. I went on date night with my hubbie and there was ...4 12yr olds sitting in front of us. I went to the front to let the person know about the kids and they just laughed and said well try to keep an eye out.
