Patients with subependymal heterotopias had a significantly higher prevalence of normal development than patients in the other two groups (P = .02). When all patients with gray matter heterotopias were considered, patients with thick heterotopias and those with overlying cortical gyral anomalies, which correlated with one another, had a significantly higher prevalence of developmental delay (P = .002).
