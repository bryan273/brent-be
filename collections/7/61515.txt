Ruby Tuesday in Muncie is the best restaurant in town. The manager, John Dorer , is the best manager that I have ever seen. He is friendly, helpful, courteous, caring, and every other adjective that a great restaurant manager should be.He is easy going, helpful, friendly, and very efficient. You never see him just doing nothing.
