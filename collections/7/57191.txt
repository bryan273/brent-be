In the corneal reflex, the ophthalmic nerve acts as the afferent limb â€“ detecting the stimuli. The facial nerve is the efferent limb, causing contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle. If the corneal reflex is absent, it is a sign of damage to the trigeminal/ophthalmic nerve, or the facial nerve.
