Gums can't grow back but you can stop gum disease. I am 52 and here is how I did it. Use a salt based toothpaste (mostly made in Germany). Dip toothbrush in 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and brush teeth and especially tongue, rinse with water and then take 1/2 teaspoon of xylitol (the biggest killer of mouth bacteria).
