All Loads of hay/alfalfa are weighed prior to being brought in and the bale weights are then averaged. When prices are listed as AVERAGED price per ton, that is all it is, an AVERAGE. When you calculate what your hay costs will be, remember that you are buying it BY THE BALE as this is the legal method of selling hay. To calculate price per ton: Divide 2000 by the weight of the bales, then multiply that by the price of the bale.
