This use is a subset of a language's lexicon that is generally considered to be strongly impolite, rude or offensive. It can show a debasement of someone or something, or show intense emotion. Profanity in this sense takes the form of words or verbal expressions. In its older, more literal sense, the term profanity refers to offensive words, or religious words, used in a way that shows the user does not respect God or holy things, or behaviour showing similar disrespect.
