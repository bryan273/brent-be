By Brad Benner July 2, 2011 - 6:14 am. I was in India for the first time for seven weeks this past February and March. I had wanted to go for such a long time – I felt called to the country for some reason. India is a country that takes people in, chews them up, and spits them out.i Guys, I am an Indian and I can attest to the account of filthiness that you’ve given. One of the reasons that India is filthy is that people are lazy to the bone. Those lazy people (labeled as middle class) then employ desperate poor people for menial jobs.
