Dictionaries - Easton's Bible Dictionary - Concubine. Concubine [B] [S] in the Bible denotes a female conjugally united to a man, but in a relation inferior to that of a wife. Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank.
