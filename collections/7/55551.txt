Grandma called it roughage and everyone, kids included, needs plenty of it each day to keep their digestive system working well. Hereâ€™s how to get your kids used to the taste of fiber-rich foods, which they can come to love. A bowl of high-fiber cereal is a great start to meeting your child's daily needs. Read food labels to find whole-grain cereals that provide 3 grams or more of fiber per serving. Usually, the more sugar in a cereal, the less fiber. Add sweetness to cereal with fresh, canned (unsweetened), or frozen fruit.
