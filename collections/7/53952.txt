1 Start by removing the outer layer of white (unless it is very fresh or from your own garden). 2  Trim the base with a sharp paring knife to remove all the roots.  Make an incision in the middle of the white stalk and cut toward the green tips, severing the leek in two, but with the bottom still intact.
