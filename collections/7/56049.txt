What is an LPCC? LPCC stands for Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor. This license was earned through my graduate studies, training and testing requirements in the state of Ohio. It signifies I maintain the standards set forth by the Ohio Counselor, Social Worker, and Marriage and Family Therapist Board. It is also a credential that qualifies for mental health insurance reimbursement. However, my training has been and continues to be more extensive. In fact, I spend more time and money on education and training now than when I was working toward my LPCC. This is because the advances in many fields, such as neuroscience, psychotherapy and psychoanalysis continue to impact the ways we understand emotional problems and suffering.
