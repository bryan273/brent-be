You're receiving the signal but may not have the tools to get it. First, make sure you own a high definition television and receiver. If so, locate the HD channels on your programming lineup as channels are split between HD and non-HD channels. Also, verify the program you're watching is offered in HD. Many HD channels run a non-HD signal when showing non-HD programming.
