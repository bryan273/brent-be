What does a Maltichon look like. The Maltichon is a small dog weighing 8 to 12 pounds and measuring just 8 to 10 inches in height. He can have a double coat or single depending on who takes more after. The single can be silky to touch, but with a double coat the outer is rough and the inner is dense.
