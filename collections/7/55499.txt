When I have to loosen and tighten my car's positive battery terminal, I use a ratchet, a 3 extension, and a 10mm socket. With a few inches of elevation, the ratchet is much less likely to ground itself to the negative terminal or the hold-down bracket. Acid-resistant gloves and eye protection are still a great idea.
