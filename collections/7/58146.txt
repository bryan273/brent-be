Animals mix the soil and make spaces in it for air and water. Earthworms do most of the work of mixing humus with other materials in the soil. They carry humus down to the subsoil and subsoil to the surface. Burrowing mammals (like mice, gophers, prairie dogs) break up the hard, compacted soil and mix humus through it. They also add nutrients when the leave waste or die.
