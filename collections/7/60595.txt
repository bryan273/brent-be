State law governs the entire process. The tax calendar each year has four parts. January 1 marks the beginning of the appraisal phase. Between January 1 and April 30, the appraisal district values the property in county and acts on exemptions, renditions and special appraisals. The protest period generally begins May 15 after the appraisal district has sent out appraisal notices.
