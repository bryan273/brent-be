Orbison started writing this song for a country singer named Don Gibson; the working title was Once Again.. Orbison's songwriting partner, Joe Melson, then came up with the lyrics, Once again I'm crying, once again I'm crying, which became the basis for the song, so Orbison changed the title. Orbison claimed the stunning climax at the end of the song was not contrived, but just happened in the course of the song.
