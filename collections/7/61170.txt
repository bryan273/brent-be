In California, sellers are required to provide a smog certificate. Make sure you get one. Stuff on smog checks: 1, 2, 3. Frankly, I'm still a bit confused myself when I will need to do a smog check. Check that the registration is current and that the car wasn't repurchased under the California Lemon law.
