Participants worked out at three different times: 7 a.m., 1 p.m. or 7 p.m. Turns out, those who hit the treadmill at 7 a.m. slept longer and had deeper sleep cycles than those who exercised at other points in the day. In fact, the morning crowd spent up to 75% more time in the reparative “deep sleep” stage at night. As a bonus, early birds also experienced a 10% reduction in blood pressure during the day and a 25% dip at night.
