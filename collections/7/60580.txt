Example of Net Realizable Value. ABC International has a green widget in inventory with a cost of $50. The market value of the widget is $130. The cost to prepare the widget for sale is $20, so the net realizable value is $60 ($130 market value - $50 cost - $20 completion cost).Since the cost of $50 is lower than the net realizable value of $60, you continue to record the inventory item at its $50 cost.In the following year, the market value of the green widget declines to $115.ince the cost of $50 is lower than the net realizable value of $60, you continue to record the inventory item at its $50 cost. In the following year, the market value of the green widget declines to $115.
