It doesn't. The Earth orbits the sun in the same direction that it rotates. That's because both the orbit and the rotation are the result of the rotation of the cloud of gas and dust that collapsed to form the solar system. Our rotation and axis were changed when Earth was wacked by the impactor that resulted in the moon.
