Comments. 1  This doesn’t apply to the smell but my son has a “letterman” jacket. The construction is wool on the body and plastic (faux leather) on the sleeves. 2  Some plastics (faux leathers) start to disintegrate after a period of time. I had a famous maker high quality shoe that had rubber/something /composite heels.
