Your hair lives in a state of constant cyclical movement. At any given moment a certain percentage of hair is in a “Growth Phase” (usually about 85 percent of hairs), a “Transitional Phase,” or a “Resting Phase.” When a given hair follicle transitions from resting to growth, the old hair is pushed out by a new hair.
