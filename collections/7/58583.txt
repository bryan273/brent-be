Some players will play lossy formats such as *.mp3, etc. and various lossless compressed files such as FLAC. IMO, the best option is to get a nice CD player that has a USB interface and/or a SD card port. Put all of my lossless audio on an iPod or its equivalent, and then just plug it into the player. Using a SD/MMC card port gives one the opportunity to build an audio-mobile library using the cards.
