The missing teeth of upper jaw can be replaced with ceramic permanent teeth on implants in 3 days with new generation immediate loadable, single piece implants. We use basal implants in combination with crestal implants. With the help of pterygoid implant cantilevers are avoided. As such we easily give 14 teeth by providing second molars also. Depending on the quality and quantity of bone we place 8 - 10 implants to give a full set of 14 teeth.
