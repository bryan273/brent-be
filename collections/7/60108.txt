Mass vs Volume. Mass and volume are fundamental properties of matter, and these two properties are related to each other. Mass will be proportional to volume when the density is a constant. If anything possesses a volume, it also has a mass. Mass. Mass is a property of matter which is a measure of inertia. It also gives an idea of how much matter is there in the object. It is one of the three fundamental dimensions (M) of mechanics (time – T and length – L are the other two fundamental dimensions). SI unit (International System of Units) for mass is ‘kilogram’.
