In this sense it is often used by the classic English writers, as in Milton's the last infirmity of noble minds; compare Caesar, IV, iii, 86. The infirmity which a man of resolution can keep under by his will (Proverbs 18:14) may be either moral or physical. In Luke 13:11 the woman's physical infirmity is ascribed to the influence of an evil spirit.
