To reduce inflammation and the resulting swelling and pain, injured tissue needs to be properly treated. The earlier you start treatment, the better. Initial treatment for acute inflammation in the foot or ankle consists of RICE therapy: 1  Rest: Stay off the foot or ankle. 2  Ice: Apply an ice pack to the injured area, placing a thin towel between the ice and the skin. 3  Compression: An elastic wrap should be used to control swelling.
