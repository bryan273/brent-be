Save. Zinc plating is a common coating on hardware items such as screws and nuts. It is primarily used to provide a protective barrier against oxidation. However, if this plating is incompatible with other types of hardware, as can often happen, it must be removed.et the items sit for 12 hours. Use a glass ladle or other corrosive resistant tool to remove the items from the bath. If the glossy zinc coating is not fully removed, submerge the items again for an hour and check them again. Place the items on a glass or ceramic plate and allow them to air dry.
