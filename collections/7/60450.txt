The New Psychiatry means using all tools at our disposal, including medications, therapy, self-help books, yoga, politics, music, and whatever else works. It is not beholden to any commercial enterprise, such as the pharmaceutical or device industries. It is not hypnotized by the DSM-4 (our diagnostic manual), but sees it for what it is-an elaborate list and a useful field guide, but not a bible. Maybe you've been lucky enough to see a New Psychiatrist..
