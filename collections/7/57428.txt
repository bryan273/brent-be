To relieve mild menstrual cramps: 1  Take aspirin or another pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). (Note: For best relief, you must take these medications as soon as bleeding or cramping starts.) 2  Place a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower back or abdomen.
