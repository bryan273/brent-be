Monomer of Nucleic Acid. Biomolecules are organic molecules which take part in all the metabolic activities of the living body. Vitamins, lipids, carbohydrates, hormones, proteins and nucleic acids are examples of Biomolecules. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA are also polymeric forms. There are nitrogenous bases, five-carbon sugar and a phosphate group which bonded with each other to form a DNA or RNA molecule. These Biomolecules involve in the transfer of genetic information from one generation to the next generation in the living organisms.
