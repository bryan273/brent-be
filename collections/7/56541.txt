Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of back pain in adolescents and young adults. The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is genetically inherited. The HLA-B27 gene can be detected in the blood of most patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis can also affect the eyes, heart, lungs, and occasionally the kidneys.
