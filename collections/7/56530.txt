Best Answer: Karate is a Japanese word adopted in the 1920's to represent the martial systems of Okinawa. In Okinawa they referred to it as China Hand, or Kempo, before it ever became known as Karate. When Gichin Funakoshi traveled to Japan and began changing the system he taught to make it more Japanese in order for more of them to accept it is when the word Karate was first adopted; however it was first used in 1909.
