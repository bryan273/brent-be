Could, can, and would can be confusing in English. Editor Kory Stamper gives an explanation of how they are used. Could, would, and can are all modal verbs (for more on some modal verbs, click here), and they can be difficult to master.ike can, could can be used of possibility as well, but the connotation is slightly different. In the sentence We can have as many as ten people for dinner tonight, can is used to show ability (We are able to have as many as ten people for dinner tonight; “We have enough food/space for ten people.”).
