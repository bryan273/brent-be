A common pipeline for device-to-device communication involves device A sending a message to the cloud, the cloud processing the message and sending it to device B, and device B receiving this message. In minimizing that middle step, you can create a functional app that only requires the free tier of Azure IoT Hub. Itâ€™s a cheap and effective way to design device-to-device communication. So, can two devices talk to each other with almost no cloud-based programming? The answer, of course, is yes.
