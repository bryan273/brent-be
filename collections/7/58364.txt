The lower the rate, the higher the PLF. The initial mortgage insurance premium (MIP) payable. This is significantly higher (2.5 percent of the propertyâ€™s appraised value) for those who wish to withdraw 60 percent or more of the total made available under the reverse mortgage during the first year of the loan. Those who need less than 60 percent in those first 12 months pay just 0.5 percent.
