Long established as the No. 3 Japanese brand in the U.S. market, Nissan's record has been less consistent than those of its larger Japan-based rivals. Nissan was established in Japan in 1933 and made vehicles under the Datsun brand for decades. The first Datsun sedan arrived in the U.S. in 1958, followed a year later by a compact pickup truck.
