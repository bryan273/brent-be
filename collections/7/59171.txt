A Transmission Service is a type of automatic transmission maintenance that includes changing the transmission's fluid AND filter. First off, maintenance by servicing your automatic transmission is one of the most important things you can do to extend the life of your transmission.he only way an automatic transmission service can cause a problem is if a customer's transmission hasn't been serviced in a long time. New transmission fluid has a very high percentage of detergent in it that keeps the internal parts of the transmission very clean.
