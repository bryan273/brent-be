In the mid-17th century, English settlers named the Eleutheran Adventurers, founded the first permanent European settlement in The Bahamas, and gave the island of Eleuthera its name. As time went by, more and more of these settlements formed until the Bahamas Islands became a British Crown Colony in 1717. Woodes Rogers, a former pirate, was appointed as the first royal governor. Under his governorship, pirates and buccaneers such as Blackbeard and Henry Morgan, who frequently infested the waters around the islands, were driven off.
