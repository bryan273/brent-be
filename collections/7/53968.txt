Planting garlic offers several advantages, including repelling most wildlife who dislike the smell of the plant. Gardeners also get a nice crop of garlic to use in the kitchen, and the plants also add a nice texture to the garden. Even if the climate hinders growing garlic to full maturity, the leaves of the plant help keep critters away. Consider planting garlic in a row or in small clusters around the outskirts of the garden.
