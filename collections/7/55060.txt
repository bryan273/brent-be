Right now solar activity has been quite low (we're at the bottom of the sunspot cycle) but we've had a occasional few. In four to six years we should be seeing them much more often. First step, of course, is get yourself to a dark place void of light pollution, and Isle Royale is great. Unfortunately, it isn't like whale watching or even something predictable like an eclipse. The best science can do is predict a 'greater likelihood.'.
