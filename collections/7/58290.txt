Japanese maple trees like slightly acid, sandy loam soil with a pH of between 5.5 - 6.5. Acer maples (commonly known as sugar maples, and the kind from which you can get maple syrup) like soils that range from a pH of 5.5 - 7.3. However, they have been found growing in soils that are strongly acid at pH 3.7.
