I was trying to learn how my Hornady Lock and Load headspace guage works and get the feel for measuring case length from the shoulder the other day, then I noticed that not all of my primers were seated properly. Some were about .001 protruding from the head of the case. I know this is a bad thing for accuracy, and even worse for safety. I have been priming with my Lyman press. I put a great deal of pressure on the ram to hopefully seat the primers into the pocket deeper. I can't really do much else with the press I'm afraid, so I am considering using a hand priming tool.
