Karate, as we know it, is not one word but rather two separate kanji that denote Empty and Hand. Kara and Te are combined to mean Empty Hand, and thus it was born. It is important to note that in true Karate study one does not study the use of weapons and that is a common misconception. Weapons training is called Kobudo and is a separate art from Karate...but both origionate in Okinawa.
