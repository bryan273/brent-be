Bananas are a great dietary source of potassium. One medium-sized banana (118 grams) contains 9% of the RDI. A potassium-rich diet can help lower blood pressure, and people who eat plenty of potassium have up to a 27% lower risk of heart disease (22, 23, 24, 25). Furthermore, bananas contain a decent amount of magnesium, which is also important for heart health (26, 27). Bottom Line: Bananas are a good dietary source of potassium and magnesium, two nutrients that are essential for heart health.
