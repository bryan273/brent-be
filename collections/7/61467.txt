Addition of alloying elements is one of the methods for controlling γ grain structure. Comprehensive understanding on effects of alloying elements on the microstructure in each process of the carbon steel production is essential for producing high quality carbon steels. The additions of ferrite stabilizing elements lower the temperature for γ
