Building seawalls. One of the first steps many countries take — if they can afford it — is to build seawalls to hold the tides back.n the U.S., Alaska's village of Kivalina has constructed a wall to hold the waters back. Sea ice used to protect the barrier reef the village is situated on, but the ice melts sooner each year, leaving the community unprotected from storm waves. Even California coastal towns are preparing for rising waters.
