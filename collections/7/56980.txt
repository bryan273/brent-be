What yield seekers might not realize though is that legions of risk averse investors spooked by market volatility and starved for yield have bid up utility stocks to pricey levels. Historically, the utility sector has an average price/earnings ratio about 25% below the overall market. Today the sector trades at a large premium to the market. According to S&P IQ, the utility sector within the S&P 500 stock index has a PE ratio of 15.6 based on estimated 2012 earnings. The overall PE ratio for the S&P 500 index is 13.1. And with a forecast of sluggish earnings growth in 2013 for the sector, that high valuation is expected to persist next year as well. S&P IQ forecasts a 15.1 2013 PE ratio for the utility sector, compared to 11.7 for the overall S&P 500.
