Eastern Europe, politically, it's outside the EU. Poland is inside. I think that politically/economically speaking, it's safe to say that central Europe is the orbit of Germany, western Europe is the orbit of France, England or Spain (former praefecture of Gallia) and eastern Europe is the orbit of Russia.
