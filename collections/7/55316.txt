The Relative Humidity expresses how much moisture is in the air, as a percentage of the total moisture the air could contain at the current temperature. In other words, if the air has all the water vapor that it can contain at a given temperature, the relative humidity is 100%. However, the warmer the air, the more water vapor it can contain, and the cooler the air, the less vapor it can contain.
