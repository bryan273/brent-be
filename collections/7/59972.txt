Peel onions, using a paring knife to remove skins. Place onions on metal skewer to make a hole. Place 4 to 6 onions (all the same size to cook at the same rate) on each rosemary stem, and brush with olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. Place on grill, over medium high heat, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, for a total of 12 to 16 minutes until tender. Be careful not to char onions. When finished grilling remove from heat. Brush with Cilantro butter if desired.
