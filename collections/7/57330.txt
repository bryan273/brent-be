Demons can smell like sulfur, roses, cologne...anything! They can also appear as: an angel of light, a dead person or child, a spirit guide, a healing spirit (reiki), an alien, a fairy, a dwarf, a spirit animal etc! We can't safely discern them! The safest thing to do, is let Jesus and his angels protect us.
