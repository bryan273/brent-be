If you can use iOS and have access to both Apple's and Google's apps, why not make the switch? In other words, why not have the best of both worlds? I love my new iPad and it is the best Google experience on the market. If the iPhone 6 has a bigger screen, I may have to switch my smartphone allegiance too.
