Which format to record Cd's playable on normal CD players. Which format do I use to record Cd's that will play in my car stereo or on a normal CD player for my stereo in my house? I believe that if you select CD music format in the burning software and then add the files the software will take care of that. If you have mp3 files and want to fit a lot of them on one disc you need to make a data CD and then try it in your CD players to see if it works. Worst case you waste one blank CD. m.
