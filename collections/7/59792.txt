Click the triangle play button below to listen to this computer question and my Plain English answer: As I explain in the audio lesson, the computer term “default” is one that confuses a lot of people. Basically, it means “what the computer is set to do until you tell it to do otherwise”. So for example, you might get a brand new computer and have a certain picture set as the wallpaper (background image on the desktop) when you first turn it on. This is the default background image.
