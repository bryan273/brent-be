(Sorry, bichons are just plain not tiny dogs. Yes, yes, you've read advertisements on the internet that say 7 - 12, but years of experience and hundreds of bichons from all facets of bichonhood represent the truth, and 11-22 lbs is a much more realistic representation of how much that puppy will weigh in adulthood.)
