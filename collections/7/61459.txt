Allotropes of iron; alpha iron and gamma iron Austenite , also known as gamma-phase iron (γ-Fe), is a metallic, non-magnetic allotrope of iron or a solid solution of iron , with an alloying element. In plain-carbon steel , austenite exists above the critical eutectoid temperature of 1000 K (727°C); other alloys of steel have different eutectoid temperatures.
