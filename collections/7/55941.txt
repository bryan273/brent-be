Landowners and tenants who want to remove tree squirrels themselves should contact an IDNR District Wildlife Biologist to see if they qualify for a Nuisance Animal Removal Permit. In rural areas, gray squirrels and fox squirrels may be taken during open hunting seasons. All Illinois hunting regulations must be followed. Red squirrels and southern flying squirrels are protected by continuous closed season (i.e. these species may not be taken under authority of a hunting license).
