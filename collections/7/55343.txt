When the ushers see to it that an atmosphere of reverence and order is maintained before, during, and after the service, they do it for God.When they usher the worshippers to their seats, they do it for God.urthermore, ushering is an important factor in the church's public relations. The ushers are the representatives of the church to the people who come to worship there. Visitors receive their first impression of the church from the ushers.
