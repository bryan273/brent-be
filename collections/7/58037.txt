The roots of modern day drip irrigation (pardon the pun) can be traced to the 1860, when systems of clap pipes were developed in Germany for combination drainage/irrigation systems, and were used soon after in Afghanistan in 1866. In the 1920â€™s this idea was expanded upon (again in Germany) utilizing a system of perforated clay pipes.
