That is a radon concentration expressed in pCi/l derived from WLs in risk estimates are not the same as radon concentrations expressed in pCi/l when measured by a home inspector or other radon mitigation service. Equilibrium is said to have been reached when the maximum concentration of SLRDs has been reached.adon and Health When radon decays, it too produces a decay chain, with its own daughters. During its decay, it releases a large atomic alpha particle and the atom is transmuted into polonium. An alpha particle is essentially an helium atom stripped of its electrons.
