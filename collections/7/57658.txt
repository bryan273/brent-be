Thus dressed, these final fat products pass into spaces between the cells and into the villi. Most of these fatty acids are then propelled, along with lymph (a fluid) by the lymphatic pump system. About 80 to 90 percent of digested fat is absorbed in this manner. Small amounts of fatty acids are absorbed directly into the blood going to the liver. Digestion of fatty acids from triglycerides is different for the regular long-chain fatty acids (14 carbons to 22 carbons) than it is for short- and medium-chain fatty acids (4 carbons to 12 carbons).
