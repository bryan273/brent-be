Hydrogen Sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide gas produces an offensive rotten egg or sulfur water odor and taste in the water. In some cases, the odor may be noticeable only when the water is initially turned on or when hot water is run. Heat forces the gas into the air which may cause the odor to be especially offensive in a shower.
