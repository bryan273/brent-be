The best predictor is parent's eye color—if both parents have dark brown eyes, the odds of you having a blue eyed baby is rare. Though I've seen babies born with dark eyes, they tend to go from lighter to darker. Also, don't worry if the whites look bluish at first—this is normal, and they'll get lighter.
