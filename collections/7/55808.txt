Cool Whip is a brand of imitation whipped cream, referred to as whipped topping by its manufacturer. It is used in North America as a dessert topping and in some no-bake pie recipes.It was originally described as non-dairy as it contained neither cream nor milk and no lactose; however, it did contain the milk derivative casein. In 2010 both skim milk and light cream were added to Original Cool Whip.ool Whip was formerly marketed as non-dairy, but in Jewish dietary traditions, Cool Whip was classified as dairy rather than parve (non-meat and non-dairy) because of the sodium caseinate (which is derived from milk).
