Countries struggling with climate change could learn a lot from a constellation of tiny islands in the Indian Ocean. The Republic of Maldives was one of the first countries to recognize the danger of rising sea levels.It's also one of the first to come up with a plan to adapt to a warmer world.he Maldives was the first country to sign the Kyoto protocol to fight global warming.

So Gayoom, ruler of the Maldives for 30 years now, has been experimenting with a more hands-on approach, starting with a project near his presidential palace.
