Best Answer: First question : This is a bit tricky. Yes, it DOES depend on the wavelength of the light wave, but, all other things being equal, it is an INVERSE dependence on wavelength, rather than a direct dependence. So, with that understanding, the answer is TRUE. See the next, parenthetical paragraph for factors involved other than the wavelength.
