After multiple trips to the California wine country, we became interested in growing grapes. It wasnâ€™t long before we started a test plot of 30 vines behind the house in our neighborhood. It took hours of exhausting work to chisel out rocks for the fence posts, trellis system, and vines, but we loved the challenges. Each day we made a little progress and toasted our success with a glass of wine.
