One of the most common causes of foot or ankle pain is tendonitis. The muscles of your leg, foot, and ankle are anchored to the bone by the tendons, which are strong, cord-like structures. Tendonitis is inflammation surrounding a tendon. You will have pain with activity and it usually goes away with rest, only to return again. The most common types of foot and ankle tendonitis are Achilles tendinitis, posterior tibial tendonitis, peroneal tendinosis, flexor tendonitis, and extensor tendonitis. 1  Self-care measures will usually heal these injuries over the course of a few weeks.
