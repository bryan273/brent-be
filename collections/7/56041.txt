People have been asking “How hard is the LPCC gap exam?” Personally I would say based on my experience – well that depends on whether or not you known the answers. Since the exam is only on the differences between LCSW, LMFT and LPCC’s there is a lot of material to cover in a very few questions. If you graduated recently or have been studying LPCC material since graduation you should be in good shape.
