Earth rotates on an axis. During the winter, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun's rays. As Earth travels around the Sun, the tilt of Earth changes. By June, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and the days become very long. Earth takes a year to orbit the Sun and it is the tilt which creates the seasons.
