The Bloodgood Japanese Maple Tree does not require fertilizer; however, if your soil is lacking in nutrient matter, a slow release well-balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) can be applied once in the spring to help prompt tree growth. Mulch is a great tool to use when planting Japanese Maples. Simply apply a 3-inch layer of natural mulch, such as those made of wood chips or bark, in a 3-foot radius around the treeâ€™s base. Water the mulch, which will help conserve water and, when decomposed, add nutrient matter to the soil.
