One of the times that I called I left my phone number but Sallie Mae never returned my callâ€“again it does not amaze me. Very poor customer service. I could testify to this because I pay about 10 different bills by phone from overseas with 3 that are college loans and Sallie Mae is the only one I appear to have ongoing poor service. I sure miss the bank who serviced my loan before Sallie Mae bought it.
