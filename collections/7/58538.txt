Swisher Sweets. Swisher Sweets makes everything from smokeless tobacco, to premium cigars, to cigarillos. A favorite of many cannabis users, the cigarillos are generally bought as large joint wraps, known as blunts. To roll a blunt, most people use a razor blade or sharp knife to cut the wrap open, lengthwise.
