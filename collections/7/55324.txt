In this case, cold air is a smaller cup and warm air is a larger cup. So when the air is colder, the same amount of water vapor will produce a higher relative humidity than the same amount of water vapor in warmer air. This is because we have to consider the amount of water vapor relative to what the air can hold. Let's look at an example. You have two cups, one that can hold a maximum of 12 ounces and one that can hold a maximum of 24 ounces.
