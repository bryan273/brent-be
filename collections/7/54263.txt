Every state within the United States allows a landlord to collect a security deposit from a tenant. The maximum amount of security you can collect depends on the location of your rental property. Some states, such as Illinois and Texas, have no limit on the maximum amount of security deposit you can collect. Other states allow landlords to charge tenants a maximum of anywhere from one to three monthsâ€™ rent as a security deposit.
