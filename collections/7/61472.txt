[b] So, from an artillery engineering perspective, the German 88mm really wasn't enything special, and certainly did not warrant the disruption to Allied manufacturing production lines that would have been involved in producing copies of it. In reality, the 88mm got its well-deserved reputation as an AT super-gun ...nce the allies were aware there were many reasons to admire the 88mm Gun they began to devise an even better bigger gun, specifically the 105 MM L7 cannon.... No it never makes sense to copy an enemies gun it makes sense to improve upon it.
