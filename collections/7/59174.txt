Keep in Mind: An automatic transmission fluid service will replace the pan gasket, filter, and transmission fluid. Some vehicles do not have a serviceable transmission filter and some transmissions are designed to be “sealed for life,” meaning that they do not require any service or maintenance.n an automatic transmission car, the transmission system has an oil pan that contains the transmission fluid and fluid filter. The fluid provides the power/force required to shift into different gears. In manual transmission cars, there is a case that contains the transmission fluid.
