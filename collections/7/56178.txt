Prevailing winds and pressure belts are major climate controls. A belt of low pressure known as the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) lies along the Equator. On either side of the equatorial low, between 25° and 30° latitude in each hemisphere, is a belt of high-pressure centers over the oceans. From the equatorial side of these subtropical highssuch as the Hawaiian high.
