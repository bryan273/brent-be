NEW YORK â€” The playboy boyfriend of a fashion designer was convicted Thursday of strangling and drowning her in the bathtub of a swank hotel room. Nicholas Brooks, whose father was an Oscar-winning composer who wrote You Light Up My Life, put his face in his hands silently as the murder verdict was read. His girlfriend, Sylvie Cachay, was found partially clothed in an overflowing tub in their rented Manhattan hotel room on Dec. 9, 2010.
