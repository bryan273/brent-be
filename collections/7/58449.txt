Just as fast as my feet can fly. Come away, come away if you're goin'. Leave the sinkin' ship behind. Come on the risin' wind, We're goin' up around the bend. Oh. Bring a song and a smile for the banjo. Better get while the gettin's good. Hitch a ride to the end of the highway. Where the neon's turn to wood. Come on the risin' wind, We're goin' up around the bend.
