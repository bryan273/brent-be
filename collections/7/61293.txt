That sounds like an ineffective method to strip zinc from steel because the zinc plating is thin, and the steel will remain wetted with it; plus, it's possibly dangerous, environmentally questionable, and expensive :-).Opinion!f the plating is not defective, I think it can be a good base for the e-coating, and will offer sacrificial protection. If you remove the e-coating, you will have to phosphatize the surfaces before e-coating. Good luck.
