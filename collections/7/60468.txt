Tomato allergies are not as common as other food allergies. Tomatoes are a part of the “nightshade” allergy family. However, those that do have a severe tomato allergy face the possibility of anaphylactic shock and death. More persons actually have a food intolerance for tomatoes and not a full-blown tomato allergy.
