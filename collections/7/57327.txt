I am usually a skeptic to when it comes to Mediums and Psychics. For the past month, I have being having strange experiences. I have been woken by a strange smell of sulfur, been having very odd dreams, but what I dream is what has happened to me over the years. At first I thought it was my late dad, but after giving it much thought I realize that I would have felt a sense of calm, inner peace almost, but alas!
