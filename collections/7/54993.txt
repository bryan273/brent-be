The hypothesis that the centaur represents a terrified tribal reinterpretation of a horse and rider is probably without merit. The Greek love for the horse led to the ennoblement of the centaur in myth and legend (the only version of the kallikantzaroi to be so honored). The Centaur Chiron was known for his wisdom and healing abilities.
