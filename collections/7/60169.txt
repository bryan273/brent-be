In August 1984, Ride the Lightning was released, and did slightly better than their debut, reaching #100 on the charts. This album was seen as an improvement on their first album, furthering their rise to fame. In 1985, Metallica appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival, appearing fourth on the bill. In March of 1986 Master of Puppets was released and was their first bona fide hit album, reaching #29 on the charts - a huge success for a thrash metal band. However, on tour in Sweden that year, a horrific accident occured.
