I am looking for periodization about nursing history in Venezuela. Not one history of nursing in our country has been written until now. I have been collecting enough information since colonial time to actuality. I think that the Vargas hospita's foundation at Caracas could be useful for the periodization of this history. Your item is very important as an introduction to me because you explain some topics related to my investigation.
