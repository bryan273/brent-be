When Do Babies’ Eyes Change Color? Your child’s newborn eye color may be blue, but that doesn’t mean it’ll necessarily stay that way. “Babies’ eyes tend to change color sometime between 6 and 12 months, but it can take as long as three years until you see the true color of what their eyes are going to be,” says Barbara Cohlan, MD, a neonatologist at St. Louis Children’s Hospital.
