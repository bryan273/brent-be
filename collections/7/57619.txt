Use any old cut of meat. Using the wrong cut of beef is probably the worst mistake you could ever make when it comes to beef stew. We’ve even tried using cuts of meat that are good for braising—like sirloin—and they just didn’t break down in the same way in a stew. You’re left with chunks of tight, dry meat rather than meltingly tender beef.
