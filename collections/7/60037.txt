The final link in the chain of infection is the susceptible host. Most of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and severity of disease are related to the host, although agent and environmental factors also play a role (Table 3).However, characteristics of the host-agent interaction—such as pathogenicity, virulence, and antigenicity—are also important.ost of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and severity of disease are related to the host, although agent and environmental factors also play a role (Table 3).
