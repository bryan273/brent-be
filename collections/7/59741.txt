Government Debt and the Future. As I write this article, the federal government has accumulated $18.2 trillion of debt. In the following chart we can see how much the “public” debt has risen since 2004. In 2004, the federal debt was $7.3 trillion. This rose to $10 trillion when the housing bubble burst four years later. Today it exceeds $18 trillion and is projected to approach $21 trillion by 2019.
