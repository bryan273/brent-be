Vascular tissue is found in all of a plant's vegetative organs-that is, the roots, stems, and leaves. Xylem and phloem start out as special type of tissue called cambium. You can think of cambium tissue cells as similar to stem cells-when they divide, they have the ability to become different kinds of tissue.
