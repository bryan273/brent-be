Canada formulated as an independent nation state in 1867. Prior to that, it was comprised as a series of colonies of Great Britain. Great Britain abolished slavery in 1833. This took effect in Great Britain and its colonies in 1834, effectively covering the entire British Empire. So there was slavery in what would become Canada prior to 1834, but officially there was never slavery in Canada as an independent nation. I hope this answers the question.
