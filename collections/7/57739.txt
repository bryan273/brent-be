Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth appears to be a composite of two personages found in the account of King Duff and in the account of King Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587).ccording to some genealogists, Lady Macbeth and King Duncan 's wife were siblings or cousins, where Duncan's wife had a stronger claim to the throne than Lady Macbeth. It was this that incited her jealousy and hatred of Duncan.
