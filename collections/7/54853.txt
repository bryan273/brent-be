We realize you don't have the time to wait on the phone or in long lines, or to wade through lengthy multi-page forms. So all you need to do is submit our convenient one-page online form. Typical completion time is no longer than 5 minutes, and the Oregon EIN Number form is secured for your privacy. Then we prepare government form SS-4 and obtain your signature on it, authorizing us to work with the Internal Revenue Service on your behalf to acquire and deliver your OR Federal EIN Number. Our service fee for basic document preparation and filing depends on your business entity type.
