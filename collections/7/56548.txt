Ankylosing Spondylitis. Sacroiliitis is typically the first symptom of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Ankylosing spondylitis originates in the sacroiliac joints before progressing further up the spine through a cycle of inflammation, erosion, and calcification. See Ankylosing Spondylitis Causes and Risk Factors . Accurate diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis requires the sacroiliac joints to be visibly affected by this inflammation cycle. Detection and diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis-related sacroiliitis can be achieved through X-ray imaging, MRI scans, and/or CT scans paired with blood tests to detect elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
