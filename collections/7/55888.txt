A recreational vehicle is basically a home on wheels. As such, in addition to standard vehicle liability and collision insurance many owners choose to have comprehensive coverage -- for theft of personal items or replacement if the RV is destroyed by a fire not related to a vehicle accident. Full-timer coverage is similar to homeowners insurance because it includes liability for accidents in the RV or campsite while used as a place of residence. 2  Full-timer insurance can also cover a vehicle towed behind the motorhome.
