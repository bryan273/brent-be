Insoluble fiber tends to speed up digestion by adding bulk to stool (basically helping relieve constipation and allowing you to poop). Insoluble fiber is found in many whole grains like brown rice, barley and bulgur, plus most vegetables, including root veggies, broccoli, cucumbers, carrots, green beans and zucchini.
