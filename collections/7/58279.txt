Expression of Dp260 has also been found in brain and cardiac muscle. Transcripts originate from a promoter/exon 1 sequence located in intron 29 of the dystrophin gene which is alternatively spliced (White,R.A. GenBank accession number U27203). This alternative splicing creates two Dp260 isoforms, Dp260-1 and Dp260-2.
