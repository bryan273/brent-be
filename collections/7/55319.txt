Humidity describes the amount of water vapor in the air, and the more water vapor that is present, the more humid it is. Most weather reports don't tell you the humidity, though, because the relative humidity is more relevant. This is the amount of water vapor in the air relative to what the air can hold. This is just like figuring out how much water is in a cup relative to the total amount of water that cup can hold.
