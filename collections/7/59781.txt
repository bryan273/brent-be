Step Four: Update your Records and Lodge. Once you have completed the BAS, update your records with the new information and make copies of all the relevant documentation. Then either mail a hard copy of the BAS form to the ATO, file electronically through the ATO portal, or have your agent lodge for you. Make sure you pay what you owe on time or make arrangements with the ATO for payment! Those are the basic steps to preparing and lodging a BAS with the ATO.
