Like most insurance policies, RV insurance premiums vary widely. Mozingo says coverage can cost as little as $65 annually or up to $25,000 a year, in part because RVs themselves vary from $5,000 for a nonmotorized trailer to several million for a top-of-the-line luxury RV with a hot tub and crystal chandeliers.ome people think their belongings (in the RV) are covered by their home insurance, but if you carry expensive things like a digital camera, binoculars, jewelry and electronics, you can easily exceed your coverage, says Drury.
