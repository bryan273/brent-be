The increasing focus on men and men’s organisations within. development is seen by some as a new fad, the latest silver bullet. to achieving gender equality, and a threat to women’s organisation. and women’s movements. In this view, donor attention to men’s. organisations seems to signify a shift of support away from. women’s empowerment and women’s leadership, and a handing. over of the reins in the struggle for gender equality to men.
