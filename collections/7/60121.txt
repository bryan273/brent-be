In late 1997, a few months after this song peaked on the American charts, Mattel announced that they were changing Barbie's body for just the third time in her history. Barbie's new body had a bigger waist, slimmer hips and breasts that were shrunk to an honest B cup. Aqua is not the first group to be sued over Barbie. Director Todd Haynes was also sued by Mattel for his use of the doll in the 1987 film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story.
