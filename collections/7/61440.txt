Audience: IT Professionals. The Office Customization Tool lets you create a Setup customization file (.msp file) to configure user settings to customize the user's environment before you deploy Office 2013. For example, you can use the OCT to configure the default settings for several AutoCorrect options in Word 2013. When you configure a user setting, that setting is in place when the user first runs an Office application.
