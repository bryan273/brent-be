The mean (SD) AP diameter of the CT was 10.4 mm (1.1). Volar bowing of the retinaculum was seen in 7.3% of normal wrists. CONCLUSIONS: The normal range at two SDs of the CSA of the median nerve at the inlet was 5.2-9.6 mm(2) .The upper limit of volar bowing of the flexor retinaculum was 0.8 mm.The FR overlaps with values obtained in other studies of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.
