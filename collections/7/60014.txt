Trees For Houston is a non-profit organization dedicated to planting, protecting and promoting trees. In our 33 years, we have planted 535,897 trees to benefit the Houston community. We recognize that trees clean the air, mitigate run off, cool the surroundings and beautify our neighborhoods. You can help. You can plant, donate, learn, work and make friends. Houston needs trees. We need you.
