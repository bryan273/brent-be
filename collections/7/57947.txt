At third quarter the moon will be leading the sun across the sky by ninety degrees, so in the morning when the sun is in the eastern part of the sky, the moon will be in the western part of the sky. The moon looks dim and weak during the daylight hours, and is sometimes hard to find in the endless blue sky at first. Once one person spots it and points, it is easy for the others to see it. Make it a game to see who can find it first; kids have sharp eyes.
