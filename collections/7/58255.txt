DAKAR, Senegal (CNN) -- Her plane is called Bright Star. When I settle into my seat in the back of the 757, I can tell immediately this is going to be different from traveling with the president. I see the first lady two sections up chatting casually with her staff, sitting comfortably with her seat facing the back of the plane. There is a clear view of her, and my colleague beside me can't help but take a few pictures during this candid moment.
