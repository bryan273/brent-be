At first we planned on having a cabinet maker build a pantry cabinet to match our existing kitchen, but when we had one come out he quoted us $3,000 for a pantry in this space! We knew that wasnâ€™t going to happen so when we ordered the closet door for the girl room we also ordered one for a pantry.
