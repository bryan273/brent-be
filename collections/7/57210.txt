Henry Ford. Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1908. Even though he was far from being the first car inventor, Ford created a conveyor-belt assembly line that revolutionized the auto manufacturing process, allowing the company to build vehicles faster. By 1914, a Model T could be assembled in about 90 minutes.
