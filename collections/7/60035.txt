You're already on your knees. White lightning-both ends burnin', like a moth to a flame white lightning-you're goin' off the rails like a runaway train... Lyrics taken from http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/def_leppard/white_lightning.html.Like. Tweet.hen you come down here, you're already on your knees. You wanna ride white lightning, then sign your name. You wanna dance with the devil, better play his game. Play the game. You gotta taste that sweetness, cause you can't say no.
