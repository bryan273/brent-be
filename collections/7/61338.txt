Kanye West, Justin Bieber and Drake 'will BOYCOTT this year's Grammy Awards for being irrelevant and racist'. It used to be the most prestigious award a musician could hope to receive, but now the Grammys are having a hard time just getting their nominees to even show up. Insiders say A-list musicians including Kanye West, Justin Bieber and Drake are all planning on boycotting the ceremony on February 12. Despite having been nominated for four Grammys, insiders tell TMZ Justin, 22, has no intention of attending this year's awards show, and is actually making plans to be somewhere else on the day.
