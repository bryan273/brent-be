Still, it was T-34 which won the war and by the way. Germans were shocked already in 1941 when they met T-34s first time and Germans military asked to copy those. instead, Germans engineers went for Tigers and Panthers. Again, the war was won Soviet T-34s not by Shermans which basically had similar idea behind them.he Soviets did share intelligence on the new German tanks with the U.S. and British armies. But U.S. commanders did not demand better armor or firepower for their tanks, failing to envision how the Germans would deploy growing numbers of the next-generation Panther tank in particular.
