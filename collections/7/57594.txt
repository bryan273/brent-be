If you’re looking for a cooking oil that’s suitable for high heat, safflower oil may be the right choice for you. It has a higher smoke point than corn oil, canola oil, olive oil, sesame oil, and many other alternatives. It also has a neutral flavor, making it an ideal choice for many recipes. Safflower is a tall plant with spiked leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The flowers were used as a dye for clothing in ancient Egypt.
