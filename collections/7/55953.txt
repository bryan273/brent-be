The onions are named Vidalia because of where they are grown, Vidalia, Georgia (growing there started in the early 1930s). The different varieties are unusually sweet, due to the low amount of sulfur in the soil in which the onions are grown. The Vidalia onion was named Georgiaâ€™s official state vegetable in 1990.
