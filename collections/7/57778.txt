The CAM is always timed to #4 firing, if you can not understand that, you will FAIL ! #4 is the rear cylinder. This audit procedure allows you to find a very common timing belt slip, fast. This simple audit , will show why your 150 to 170 PSI compression is now near 80 PSI. In about 30 minutes work,,, the acid test at the bottom of this page, cures all the other causes of low compression.
