We are located at the intersection of Route 35 and 36 off of Exit 116 off the Garden State Parkway, so stop in today and find out why we're so much more than a hardware store. We love being part of the Hazlet community, and to share the love, we proudly support the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation. Our associates are excited to serve the community and look forward to seeing you in our store. Let us know how we can help with your next project.
