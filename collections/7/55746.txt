Bones of the Chest and Upper Back. The bones of the chest and upper back combine to form the strong, protective rib cage around the vital thoracic organs such as the heart and lungs. The rib cage also anchors the bones of the head, neck, shoulders, and arms to the trunk of the body. Powerful muscles that move the head and arms attach to these bones as well.
