I'm Reversing My Gum Disease Successfully. I reversed my gum disease successfully in 32 months by swishing frequently with water and cleaning once daily with a sonic toothbrush (Philips Sonicare) and a water flosser (Water Pik) before an intentional nightly fast. (2012 update: my new dentist pronounced me problem-free on December 10.)
