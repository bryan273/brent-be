You have a daily cash withdrawal limit at the ATM. And your debit card comes with a daily limit on the dollar amount of purchases you can make with your card. It is different for different people. Your daily purchase and cash withdrawal limits are printed on the materials that come with your card. Talk to your local Wells Fargo banker (you can make an appointment here) or call 1-800-TO-WELLS (1-800-869-3557) to find out more information about your daily limits.
