The pitch can be expressed numerically as a fraction. The pitch fraction represents a certain amount of vertical rise over the entire span. For example, given a roof with a rise of 4 feet and a span of 24 feet, the pitch is 1 to 6 pitch, which can be expressed as the fraction of 1/6.oth pitch and slope indicate the incline of a roof, expressed as a proportion of the vertical to the horizontal. This article describes both roof slope and roof pitch, and the differences between them, as they are not the same.
