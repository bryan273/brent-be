This type of respiration in which oxygen is not used as a final electron acceptor is referred to as anaerobic. In anaerobic respiration (respiration in absence of oxygen), pyruvate is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation.The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell.his type of respiration in which oxygen is not used as a final electron acceptor is referred to as anaerobic.
