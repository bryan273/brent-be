The vast majority of adjectives are common adjectives just as the majority of nouns are common nouns. Neither common adjectives nor common nouns begin with a capital letter. When an adjective has its roots as a proper noun, it is said to be a proper adjective. Just like a proper noun, proper adjectives always begin with a capital letter. For example, the noun country is a common noun but the word Italy is proper. Consider the following sentence: In this case the word Italian is a proper adjective because it has its origin in the proper noun Italy. Proper adjectives are often used to explicitly describe something. They also make writing clearer and more succinct. Look at the sentences below.
