HIV actually attaches to the CD4+ protein on the surface of these and other cells to gain entry. CD4+ can be likened to a doorway that HIV uses to enter the inner compartments of the cell. However, experiments in test tubes suggest that the CD4+ protein alone is not enough to allow viral entry into cells.ifferences Between CCR5 and Fusin.
