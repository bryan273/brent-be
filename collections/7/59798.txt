So what does “3×5” mean and how is it different from “5-5-5” or “3-3-3-3-3”? 3×5 means “three sets of five reps.” Generally, people take this as three sets of five reps at the same weight. 5-5-5 or 3-3-3-3-3 is generally used to imply trying to increase the weight (or vary it) each set. Okay, that’s great.
