Radiofrequency neurotomy is performed on an outpatient basis and requires only local anesthetic and mild sedation, alleviating the possible complications of open surgery and general anesthesia. The entire radiofrequency ablation procedure usually takes 30 to 90 minutes. It has a high success rate and a low complication rate. The procedure can provide lasting relief to those suffering. Multiple clinical studies show that radiofrequency neurotomy significantly reduces pain severity and frequency for 1 to 2 years in the majority of patients.
