The New Freedom sought to achieve this vision by attacking what Wilson called the Triple Wall of Privilege â€” the tariff, the banks, and the trusts. Tariffs protected the large industrialists at the expense of small farmers. Wilson signed the Underwood-Simmons Act into law in 1913, which reduced tariff rates. The banking system also pinched small farmers and entrepreneurs. The gold standard still made currency too tight, and loans were too expensive for the average American. Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act, which made the nation's currency more flexible. Unlike Roosevelt, Wilson did not distinguish between good trusts and bad trusts. Any trust by virtue of its large size was bad in Wilson's eyes.
