Japanese people do not have bad teeth. Dental care is covered by health. insurance, so almost everone gets real teeth problems fixed. However, they do not get their teeth corrected for cosmetics purposes that often. Orthodontics and cosmetic dentristry are not as ubiquitous as they are in the United States.
