As just mentioned, Lady Macbeth eventually shows weakness and starts sleepwalking (Act 5, scene 1). Here we get a view into Lady Macbeth’s unconscious mind and thereby her true feelings. Lady Macbeth seems to be fragile and vulnerable, and for the first time in the play we have sympathy for her.The sleepwalking is caused by Lady Macbeth’s attempt to repress strong feelings of guilt. Another example is the murder of King Duncan, which is essential to the whole play.When “the deed” is done, Macbeth says: “Macbeth does murder sleep — the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care” (Act 2, scene 2, Lines 35-36). Sleep is a powerful image of the natural, good and healthy.nother example is the murder of King Duncan, which is essential to the whole play.
