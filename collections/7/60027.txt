(CHORUS) And there was thunder, thunder over Thunder Road Thunder was his engine, and white lightning was his load There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the Devil s thirst The law they swore they'd get him, but the Devil got him first.et me tell the story, I can tell it all About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol His daddy made the whiskey, son, he drove the load When his engine roared, they called the highway Thunder Road.
