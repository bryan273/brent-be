A recreational vehicle (RV) is, in North America, the usual term for a motor vehicle or trailer equipped with living space and amenities found in a home. Several definitions exist for RVs and vary by region, including camper van, caravan, and motorhome, but are also used to designate different types of vehicles outside North America.
