Iâ€™m going to walk you through how I hard-boil eggs, and seriously, the eggs are gloriously easy to peel every single time. First, you want to give the eggs a hot start. For the longest time I thought a cold start was the way to go (a method my father-in-law swore by), but a cold start makes for difficult peeling.
