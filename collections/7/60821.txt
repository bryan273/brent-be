I recieved this awesome purse for Christmas and I can't get this fishy odor out of it. I've tried washing it, letting it air out, spraying it with febreeze, and have used fabric softners. I don't understand why it stinks so badly. The fishy odor is horrible..my kids even complain when I open it. I could really use any advice on how to get the smell out.
