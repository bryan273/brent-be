You are here: Instant SSL Home > HTTPS > Difference between HTTP and HTTPS HTTP and HTTPS: What do they do, and how are they different? You click to check out at an online merchant. Suddenly your browser address bar says HTTPS instead of HTTP. What's going on? Is your credit card information safe? Good news. Your information is safe. The website you are working with has made sure that no one can steal your information. Instead of HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), this website uses HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure . Using HTTPS, the computers agree on a code between them, and then they scramble the messages using that code so that no one in between can read them. This keeps your information safe from hackers.
