This measurement refers to the thickness and width of the lumber and the length varies. In reality, these measurements are not a true measurement of the lumber thickness or width. The true measurement of a 2x4 is actually about 1.5x3.5.oard Foot: Rough sawn lumber is usually sold by the board foot (bd. ft.). A board foot is equal to a piece of wood 12 inches long x 12 inches wide and 1 inch thick, or 144 cubic inches. To figure the board foot measurement of a piece of wood, multiply the length x width x thickness in inches, then divide by 144.
