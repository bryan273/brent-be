The amplitude of a light wave can be measured, but if you start thinking about photons instead of waves you will start getting into a little trouble. The amplitude of light, in a classical sense, is a measurement of its intensity (brightness). Getting into photons means getting into Quantum Mechanics (QM), and we lose the idea of wave amplitude for particles of light. There is a concept of probability amplitude in QM, but that is not a physical wave amplitude.
