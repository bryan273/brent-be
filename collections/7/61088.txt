Toxicity is caused by an overdose of topical (external) flea and tick control products containing pyrethrin, permethrin or other pyrethroids. It can also result from using pyrethrin containing flea products made for dogs, which are made with higher levels of pyrethrin â€” levels that are unsafe for cats.
