Deer destroy gardens by feeding on plant leaves, stems and roots. Fortunately, catnip, chives, dill, garlic, lavender, onion, oregano, rosemary, sage, spearmint and thyme keep deer away from your garden, lawn and shrubbery. While people find the smell of these herbs pleasant, deer dislike their odor and give areas planted with them a wide berth.
