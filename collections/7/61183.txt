Set survivorship for age category 0 at 1.0. In other words, everyone reaches this category. Signify survivorship for age class 0 as l0. To calculate l1, survivorship from age 0 to age 5, subtract the proportion of the population dying during that interval from 1.0 (i.e., l1 = l0 - proportion dying during interval 0). To calculate survivorship for age group 2, subtract the proportion dying during period 2 (6-10 years) from l1.
