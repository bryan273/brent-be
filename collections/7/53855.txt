For Myrtle Beach itself, much of it is overbuilt and unattractive with a gaudy, commercial feel and an exceptionally high crime rate. The city sits on a sandy barrier island in extreme northeastern South Carolina. Areas of level plain and low sand hills and pine trees cover the island and inland sections.
