The speed at which the waves carry this energy is related to the wave speed, which is the wave length divided by the wave period (since the wave has to travel one wave length every wave period). Shoaling and refraction of waves occur when the waves are in shallow water. If the water depth is less than half the wave length, then the wave is considered to be in shallow water. In the deep ocean, tsunamis (earthquake-generated waves) are considered shallow water waves (1).
