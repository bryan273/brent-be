I woke up Monday morning with a terrible pain in my heart. This is a sharp pain that has been constant since I woke up and worsens during deeper breaths, coughing and laughing. I am not worried that it is a heart attack or anything, but I am concerned of it being a pulled muscle or something else that I should be fearfull of.
