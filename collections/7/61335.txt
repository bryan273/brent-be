Justin Bieber has been nominated for 4 Grammys while Drake holds 8 nominations. Kanye West also has 8 nominations but he will also not be attending the Grammys. But Kanye has his own reasons for boycotting Grammy Awards 2017. West has about 21 Grammys to his name till date but he feels every time he is pitted against a white artist, he ends up losing. An insider says, “There’s no real anger, it’s just that a lot of younger singers think the Grammys are out of touch and arguably irrelevant.”
