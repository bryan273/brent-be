2014 Six Flags Season Pass eCoupons. If you’ve ever had a Six Flags season pass, then you’re probably familiar with the season pass coupon book. Every year, Six Flags provides its season pass holders with a small booklet full of coupons that could be ripped out and redeemed throughout the year. They range anywhere from getting $1 off the price of a drink all the way up to getting a friend into the park for free.
