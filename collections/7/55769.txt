Example: Using Excel's UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER Functions. In the image above, the UPPER function located in cells B1 and B2 is used to convert the data in cells A1 and A2 from lower case to all upper case letters. In cells B3 and B4, the LOWER function is used to convert the capital letter data in cells A3 and A4 to lower case letters. And in cells B5, B6, and B7, the PROPER function corrects the capitalization problems for the proper names in cells A5, A6, and A7.
