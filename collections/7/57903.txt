Versions you can upgrade from. The Windows 10 upgrade will be free and a one-step process for consumers using the current versions of Windows 7 (SP1) and Windows 8 (8.1). If you’re using an older version (Windows 7 or Windows 8 proper), you’ll have to upgrade to the current version first.lmost everybody will get the operating system either on a new PC (where the PC manufacturer pays for it), through work (where the company pays for an upgrade), or through the free-upgrade offer. There are, though, “edge cases” that add up to a small fraction of Windows users.
