Re: What does ETA mean? I didn't mean to be flip in the prior post, but I do think its a fact that the ETA movement was introduced by a division within Eterna, whether they chose the name ETA at random I do not know. ETA AG was formed in 1932 as a subsidiary to Eterna and was a member of Ebauches SA. In 1982 all the remaining ebauches left in Ebauches SA were merged into ETA. Thus, through a process of merging & elimination, the only part of Ebauches SA left was ETA. While it's logical to assume that the name ETA comes from ETernA the official ETA history makes no mention of this so it's still speculative. It may have had a different meaning to the originators but there is no one left who would know for sure.
