Program Description. Adoption Assistance, also known as adoption subsidies, provides financial help and services for children with physical, mental and developmental disabilities and their adoptive parents. Each state agency has its own definition of special needs used to identify children eligible for adoption assistance. General Program Requirements In order to qualify for this benefit program, you must be a parent or primary caregiver of an adopted child(ren) with special needs. Generally, the child's special needs relate to membership in a minority group, a medical condition, siblings (brothers and sisters who should not be separated), or handicaps (a child with a physical, emotional, or mental disability).
