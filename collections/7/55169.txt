Radiofrequency Ablation Radiofrequency ablation (RFA, also called Radiofrequency neurotomy or lesioning) is a minimally invasive procedure used to reduce facet joint pain in the back or neck. An electrical current produced by a radio wave is used to heat up a small area of nerve tissue, thereby decreasing the ability of those nerves to transmit pain signals from that specific area to the brain.
