Dry camping is made more comfortable by having: 1  A supply of potable water storage within the RV. 2  Enough house-battery power to supply basic camping needs (low voltage lights, water pump, control portion of refrigerator, etc.) 3  A means of recharging the house battery(s), such as solar panels or generators.
