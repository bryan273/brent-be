Keep in mind that last year, Ford was compelled to re-rate the fuel economy of the Fusion Hybrid, down from 47 mpg combined to 42 mpg combined, after the EPA revisited its fuel-economy procedures. The base engine in the Fusion S and SE is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder. It's combined with a six-speed automatic, and generates fuel economy figures of 22 miles per gallon city, 34 miles per gallon highway, or 26 mpg combined.
