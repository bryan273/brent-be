And, since it was a throat infection, you might not have been eating as well as usual. The nausea can be caused by the dizziness. I'd give the doctor a call and see what they think. Meanwhile, if you feel dizzy sit down. Don't take extra-hot showers or baths because they can make you light-headed. Don't stand for prolonged periods. Be careful when you stand up from a sitting or lying position.
