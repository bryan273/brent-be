Top Voted Answer. There are infinite rounds. But to give you a picture of the approximated lifespan, you're probably gonna last 5 levels if you're new, 10 if you know tactics, 20, if you're actually good and 30 if you're beastly. Most people will never see round 30 though, and almost nobody will see round 40. User Info: XboxHelper.
