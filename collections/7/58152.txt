The 3 basic types of soil are clay, sandy, and loamy soils. Clay is characterized by a dense, slippery texture, and sandy soils tend to be made up of large particles, primarily of silicate materials. Loamy soils are generally dark in color and composed of organic materials that have accumulated over time.
