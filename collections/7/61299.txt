Use muriatic acid with water as above (Jackalope). Then rinse the part well with water. Then immediately place the part on a hot frying pan (nothing in the pan but the part) and drive off ALL the water. Oil it immediately after it cools to where you can touch it.'m working on recreating a wartime display, and the bright shiny finish of the only lag bolts I'm able to find is a little too futuristic for my liking. Ideally I'd like to chemically / electrically strip the bright plating off and just go with the exposed steel look.
