The Cruze earns up to 42 mpg highway with its 1.4-liter four--and 46 mpg highway with its new diesel option. The Verano doesn't fare as well as most compacts in gas mileage. The Verano instead offers a larger-displacement 2.4-liter four-cylinder that drags on its fuel economy. Outfitted with its standard six-speed automatic, the Verano is pegged at 21 miles per gallon city, 32 mpg highway, and 25 mpg combined by the EPA.
