Any aggregate economic phenomena that causes changes in the value of any of these variables changes aggregate demand. If aggregate supply remains unchanged, or is held constant, a change in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve to the left or right. In macroeconomic models, a right shift in aggregate demand is typically viewed as a good sign for the economy.
