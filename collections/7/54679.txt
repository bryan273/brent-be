APA style provides guidelines not only on how to write and punctuate, but also on how to express and format numbers and percentages. Use the percent symbol after any number expressed as a numeral. For example: 12%. In APA style, numbers greater than nine are expressed as numerals and use the percent symbol. Use the word percent after any number expressed as a word. For example: five percent. Use the word percent after any number that begins a sentence, title or text heading.
