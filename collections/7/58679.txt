Advisory - the following lyrics contain explicit language: 1  Teen drinking, is very bad. Yo, I got a fake I.D. though. 2  One, here comes the two to the three to the four. Everybody drunk out on the dance floor. 3  Here comes the three to the two, to the one. Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun.  Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy.
