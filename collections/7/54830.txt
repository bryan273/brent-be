Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. Almost all babies get it before the age of 2. Your baby can get RSV at any time of year, but it's most common from November to April. Most healthy children get mild, cold-like symptoms. But RSV can be more serious in young babies, especially those who were born premature, have lung problems, heart problems or other chronic illnesses.
