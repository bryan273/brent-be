Oregon is a great choice due to favorable weather, good transportation infrastructure in the Willamette Valley, and superior scenery. The first total solar eclipse touching the continental United States since 1979 touches down on the Oregon coast between Lincoln City and Newport at 10:15 a.m. PDT. Before Oregon, the shadow of the Moon (umbra) does not touch any other landmass or island before Oregon.
