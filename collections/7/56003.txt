St. Frances Xavier Cabrini. The youngest daughter of a cherry farmer from a village near Milan, Italy, Cabrini is known as the patron saint of immigrants. After she co-founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1880, Pope Leo XIII urged her to become a missionary in the United States. In 35 years, she founded scores of schools, hospitals and orphanages, and organized adult education classes for Italian immigrants. Canonized in 1946 by Pope Pius XII.
