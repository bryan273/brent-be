The high temperature will ensure fast cooking and crisp, browned skin. Convection roast an unstuffed chicken at this temperature for 10 minutes per pound. Begin testing for doneness after the first 30 minutes, and then every 5 minutes, to ensure that the chicken is not overcooked. When it's fully cooked, the leg of the chicken will be loose when wiggled, and juices will run clear.
