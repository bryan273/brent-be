A lot of guys would hate on No Scrubs just because of what it was saying. I could be walking in the mall and hear, Chilli, I ain't a scrub. I ain't no scrub! Girls telling me, I don't want no scrub, either.. It was like the girlfriend song, for real. Guys were truly adamant about not being a scrub. I think deep down they really liked it and jammed to it in secret. The video was fun, but a little difficult.
