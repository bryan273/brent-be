Baking Time. Store-bought frozen lasagna can be baked as-is, straight from the freezer, in a pre-heated oven. Package directions will indicate how long to bake the lasagna for, but as a general rule, it takes about 90 minutes to bake an average-sized frozen lasagna. For the first portion of the baking time, the lasagna will cook with its plastic covering still on with vents cut into it.
