Extruded Discs in the Spinal Column. An extruded disc is also sometimes called a transligamentous disc, or more commonly, a ruptured disc. This disc profile entails a partial migration of all or part of the nucleus out of the annulus. Disc extrusions represent a minority of herniations, compared to the more common bulging disc profile.
