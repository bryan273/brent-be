A. So, what can we learn/deduce from this equation: 1  Glucose catabolism is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis. 2  Glucose catabolism is a redox reaction. 3  The chemical bond energy of glucose is released as ATP and heat.  This is the primary source of ATP for all aerobic 1  organisms. This is an exergonic process.
