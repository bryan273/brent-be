When acetyl-CoA is oxidized to carbon dioxide in the Krebs cycle, chemical energy is released and captured in the form of NADH, FADH 2, and ATP. The electron transport chain allows the release of the large amount of chemical energy stored in reduced NAD + (NADH) and reduced FAD (FADH 2). The energy released is captured in the form of ATP (3 ATP per NADH and 2 ATP per FADH 2). The electron transport chain (ETC) consists of a series of molecules, mostly proteins, embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The glucose required for cellular respiration is produced by plants. Plants go through a process known as photosynthesis.
