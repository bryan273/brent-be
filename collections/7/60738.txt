Fungi absorb nutrients from plant or animal matter around them, which may be living or dead. They produce long, slender threads called hyphae that spread through their food. The hyphae release enzymes that break down the food into substances that the fungi can easily absorb.hese spores then sprout on other foods. Pin molds grow on starchy foods, such as bread, in a mass of gray hyphae with black tips that release spores. The spores float to other pieces of bread. Unseen here are hyphae growing into the bread and absorbing its nutrients.
