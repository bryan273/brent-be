Many of you have asked how did I actually shop for free on the Can You Feed Your Family For Free segment on The Rachael Ray Show. (Note: Click the link to see ALL 4 videos from the segment). Items in my cart included items that usually do not have a coupon. Items such as meat, veggies, eggs and much more.
