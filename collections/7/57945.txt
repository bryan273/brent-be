Young moon, visible a day or two after the new moon phase. A young moon is seen in the west after sunset. It's a waxing crescent moon. On the day of new moon, the moon rises when the sun rises. It sets when the sun sets. It crosses the sky with the sun during the day. That’s why we can’t see the new moon in the sky. It is too close to the sun’s glare to be visible. Plus its lighted hemisphere is facing away from us. Then a day or two later, the moon reappears, in the west after sunset.
