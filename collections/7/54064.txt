Slavery was never very strong in Canada, compared to its southern neighbour. It was abolished in 1834 by an Act of Parliament in Britain. See: http://www.africanaonline.com/slavery_ca... In 1803, when Chief Justice William Osgoode ruled that slavery was not compatible with British law. This historic judgment, while it did not abolish slavery, set free 300 slaves and resulted in the rapid decline of the practice of slavery.
