Tracfone is a pay-as-you-go cellphone service. Tracfone has many different phones available to purchase and use with their service. In order to add airtime to your phone, you need to know your PIN number. This number is unique to each account. Tracfone keeps a similar menu structure in each of its phones, so the PIN location is the same no matter what phone you are using with their service. credit: KristinaJovanovic/iStock/Getty Images.
