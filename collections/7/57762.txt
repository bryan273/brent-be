Now to the question at hand â€“ can a herniated disc heal itself? There is no clear cut answer to this question that will apply to all patients. Typically a disc will not heal itself. If a disc herniates and the patient does not take action to correct the herniation, the symptoms will likely become worse as time goes on. That being said, disc herniations come in various forms.
