What is ankylosing spondylitis? Unlike ordinary back pain, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is not caused by physical trauma to the spine. Rather, itâ€™s a chronic condition caused by inflammation in the vertebrae (the bones of the spine). AS is a form of spinal arthritis. The most common symptoms are intermittent flare-ups of spinal pain and stiffness.
