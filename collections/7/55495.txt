Keeping order. We’re all taught that when jump-starting a car, you must connect the booster cables in the right sequence. Connect the positive cables to the positive terminals on each battery, and then connect the negative cable to the negative terminal on the working battery. For the last step, attach the negative cable’s other clamp to any unpainted metal on the dead car’s frame, as far from its battery as the cable allows.
