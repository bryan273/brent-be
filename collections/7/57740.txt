Massachusetts General Hospital Employee Reviews about cost of living. 7 Employee Reviews. Pay is low compared to cost of living and benefits are great but expensive. Central location, brilliant faculty, close proximity to sister labs and hospitals fosters collaborative research, lots of opportunities to transfer to other positions nearby. The labs can be pretty old, since the hospital is one of the oldest in USA.
