The simple answer is a second wife (or multiple wives). The term concubine is a relatively modern word which has different meanings with many societies. The Webster's dictionary defines this word as: a woman who cohabits with a man without being married. a secondary wife in certain polygamous societies. The bible definition aligns more closely to a polygamous society in the Ancient Scriptures of Israel (O.T), while the term “concubine” does not appear in the Christian Era Scriptures (N.T.).
