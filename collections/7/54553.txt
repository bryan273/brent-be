A rise in estrogen levels during pregnancy interrupts the normal hair-loss pattern and causes you to retain more of your hair than you normally would, explains the American Pregnancy Association. After giving birth, the hormone levels return to normal and the excess hair may fall out all at once. This hair loss is temporary and usually stops after about three to four months. A drop in estrogen levels related to discontinuation of birth control pills, menopause or miscarriage can also cause hair loss.
