Glycolysis. Cells harvest the energy contained in the chemical bonds of glucose in a very controlled, step-by-step series of reactions that release small amounts of energy during each biochemical reaction. Glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration, where a molecule of glucose is split to release energy. The process of glycolysis is an enzyme controlled, four-step reaction that occurs in the cytoplasm of the cells:
