Minor hair loss is a normal part of the hair-growing cycle. Each hair lives about 4.5 years, falls out and is replaced in about six months. If your hair is falling out in clumps, certain lifestyle practices or changes may be to blame, but consult a physician to rule out underlying medical conditions.
