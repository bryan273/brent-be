A sample of material-such as skin cells, pus, or fluid-is taken from the infection site, placed in a sterile container, and sent to the laboratory. In the laboratory, each type of culture is handled differently. Bacterial infections are the most common. Bacteria cause lesions, ulcers, cellulitis, and boils.
