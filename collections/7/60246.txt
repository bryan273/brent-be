Many cold foods can also trigger a series of sneezes, which in the case of gustatory rhinitis is a neurogenic reflex mechanism (it originates in the nervous system). Food-related sneezing can also be caused by eating large meals, as sneezing has been attributed to a distended stomach. I would recommend that your husband try to monitor his meals to see whether there are particular foods that cause him to sneeze. If there are, he can avoid them.
