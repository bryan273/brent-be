Nitric acid (H NO3), also known as aqua fortis and spirit of niter, is a highly corrosive mineral acid. The pure compound is colorless, but older samples tend to acquire a yellow cast due to decomposition into oxides of nitrogen and water.Most commercially available nitric acid has a concentration of 68%.ed fuming nitric acid, or RFNA, contains substantial quantities of dissolved nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) leaving the solution with a reddish-brown color. Due to the dissolved nitrogen dioxide, the density of red fuming nitric acid is lower at 1.490 g/mL.
