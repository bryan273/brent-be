Stripping zinc plating in preparation for E-coating. Q. Hi All, I got some parts with zinc plated surface and customers would like to remove the surface and replace by E coat. Currently I'm using HCl 30% to remove the zinc layer but it is too strong, and residue leftover causes high rejection.f the plating is not defective, I think it can be a good base for the e-coating, and will offer sacrificial protection. If you remove the e-coating, you will have to phosphatize the surfaces before e-coating. Good luck.
