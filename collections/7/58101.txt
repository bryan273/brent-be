When sinusitis causes postnasal drip, an infection of the sinuses results in the development and discharge of extra mucus from the nose. This mucus can also run down the throat, causing symptoms of postnasal drip. When postnasal drip is due to allergic rhinitis, allergens breathed into the nose trigger an allergic reaction. This leads to a release of chemicals, including histamine, which cause inflammation and the production of extra mucus.
