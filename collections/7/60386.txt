Predators of the ladybug include birds, rodents, reptiles and other insects. Ladybugs hibernate in large groups after summer when the weather becomes cooler. They do so to increase their chance of survival. Ladybugs may lay up to 2,000 eggs per year. Their eggs hatch in a few days, and after a couple of weeks, the larvae develops into pupa.
