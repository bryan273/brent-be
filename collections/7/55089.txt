In addition to measuring your reaction time, this test is affected by the latency of your computer and monitor.Using a fast computer, wired mouse, and low latency / high framerate monitor will improve your score somewhat. This is discused in further detail on the the statistics page.While an average human reaction time may fall between 200-250ms, your computer could be adding 10-50ms on top. Some modern TVs add as much as 150ms!
