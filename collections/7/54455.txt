Quick Answer. The Bataan Death March was the 60-mile forced march of nearly 80,000 U.S. and Filipino prisoners of war by the Japanese army after the fall of the Philippines in World War II. This transfer to a prison camp began on April 9, 1942, and resulted in thousands of deaths due to starvation, disease and the brutality of the capturing force.
