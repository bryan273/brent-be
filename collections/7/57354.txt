Guernica was painted and first exhibited in Paris before being placed in the care of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.he painting, which uses a palette of gray, black, and white, is known as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history. Standing at 3.49 metres (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 metres (25 ft 6 in) wide, the large mural shows the suffering of people, animals, and buildings wrenched by violence and chaos.
