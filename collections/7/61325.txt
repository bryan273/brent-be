I don't know of any way to determine the lactose content of a particular brand, sorry to say. A tenth of a percent here or there doesn't really make any difference. Don't sweat the small stuff. Aged cheeses always have lower lactose than younger cheeses. Look for the amount of aging on the label. If you want the deeper dish on these products, be sure to go through my SuperGuide to Dairy Products really carefully. 1  As a rule of thumb, the higher the fat content, the lower the lactose content. 2  Anything below 2% lactose can be tolerated well by the majority of those with LI. As long as you don't really overdo it. Ranges are important because there are huge variations from brand to brand in products like yogurt, sour cream, and ice cream.
