Reviewed February 9, 2017. After driving for hours through canyons and amazing sights thinking there would not be a place to stay, we found this gem. Everything was pristine, accoutrements were everywhere. There were amenities such as shampoo, creme rinse and lotion, coffee, microwave and refrigerator. New mattress and surrounds made it so comfortable we would have stayed longer just for the comfort.
