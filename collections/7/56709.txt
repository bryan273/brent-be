As a result, growth arrest can cause significant ulnar shortening. The distal radial physis is the most frequently injured physis in children, usually in those aged 6-10 years. Children typically sustain the injury by falling on an outstretched hand. A great majority of these injuries are SH I and SH II fractures.ecause it occurs in adolescents with relatively mature growth plates, there is minimal potential for deformity due to growth plate injury. Treatment of displaced SH III and SH IV fractures of the distal tibia requires open reduction.
