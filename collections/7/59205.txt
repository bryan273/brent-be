I am smart tho and I can acquire this one way or another for far less and probably far more potent as far as CBD to gram ratio. I am afraid of the long term effects. Im not afraid of it harming my body im afraid it will only have short term effects which will fade or stop working and then when i stop using it im far worse then I was before I started.
