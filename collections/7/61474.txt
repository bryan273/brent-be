The performance of Shermans versus the better German tanks obviously wasn't good, but in reality it had little to do with the outcome of the war. The German Tigers and Panthers were in such small numbers that their impact on the end stages of the war really was fairly minimal.nferior sometime, but allied tanks were certainly not crap. They were, in general, more reliable mechanically than German tanks. It's easy to be awed by the gun and armor of the Panther, but it was a maintenance nightmare throughout its career.
