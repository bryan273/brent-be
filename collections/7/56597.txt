Boilers are more expensive than furnaces. Mid-efficiency boilers cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000, while high-efficiency boilers run $5,000 to $10,000. Those prices include installation, but keep in mind that installing a boiler is more expensive than installing a furnace because the process is more complex.id-efficiency boilers cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000, while high-efficiency boilers run $5,000 to $10,000.
