For example, black pigments are often made from iron oxide of carbon; green from chromium oxide, ferrocyanides, or lead chromate; and white from titanium dioxide, barium sulfate, or zinc oxide. A ground-down form of plastic-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)- is used to create bright, vivid tattoo pigments.
