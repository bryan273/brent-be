Similarly, there is no financial incentive for Genentech to sell less Lucentis and more Avastin. When Avastin is used to treat cancer patients, it is often delivered at more than 100 times the dose needed for an eye injection, and a full course of Avastin treatment for cancer can cost up to $50,000 per patient.n 2010, the combined cost of using Avastin and Lucentis to treat eye disorders was around $2 billion â€” or about one-sixth of the entire Medicare Part B drug budget.
