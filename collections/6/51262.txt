Female common mergansers will often lay eggs in the nests of other females, or in the nests of other cavity-nesting ducks. Other ducks, such as the hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), also sometimes lay their eggs in the nests of this species.lso known as the goosander, the common merganser (Mergus merganser) is a large, slender diving duck with a streamlined body. It is the largest of the mergansers or ‘sawbills’ , a group of fish-eating ducks with long, narrow, serrated beaks that are ideally adapted for grasping slippery prey.
