Just south of the Platte River, stop at the first Western military post built expressly to protect Oregon Trail emigrants, Fort Kearny State Historical Park. From here, stay on US Highway 30 (I-80 is faster, but... road trip! ) through North Platte to Oglalla, then head north on US Highway 26 / State Highway 92.
