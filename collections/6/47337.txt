I’m a Fly-By-the-Seat-of-My-Pants Kinda Cook. Unless you’re cooking teeny-tiny little beans, like adzukis, you’re going to need to soak them before you cook them. Most varieties should be soaked in plenty of water for 8 hours before cooking. Now, when we say, “plenty,” we mean plenty. Cover your beans with at least two inches of liquid, says Saffitz. Those babies will absorb a lot of water as they sit, expanding as they do.
