Causes of Skin Ulcers & Draining, Oozing or Crusty Lesions on Dogs. Veterinary & Aquatic Services Department, Drs. The first sign of a skin problem may be a crusty area on the skin, nose, or foot. In other cases, skin problems which may start out small can progress and develop into more extensive lesions. They may open, drain, and then develop a crusty surface. In some instances there may be hair loss, and the surface of the skin can become red and oozing, and ulcers may develop.
