Though mood and tone are related and often confused, they are very different literary devices. Tone refers to the authorâ€™s attitude toward the work, while the definition of mood is that it is the emotions provoked in the reader. Thus, the difference can be understood in this way: tone is how the author feels, while mood is how the reader feels.
