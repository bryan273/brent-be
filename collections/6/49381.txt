So they turned to a drug called ketoprofen. The drug, a painkiller, has actually been studied as a lymphedema treatment. The problem, according to Rockson, is that ketoprofen can have side effects for the heart, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. Safer alternatives are needed, he said. To zero in on ketoprofen's good side — its action against lymphedema — the researchers used lab mice induced to have a lymphedema-like condition.
