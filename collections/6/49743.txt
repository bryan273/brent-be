Recent guest reviews. 1  The pictures of this motel are misleading. I was given a first floor room that had not been updated in 20 years. 2  The room was clean except for the carpet... our socks got very black just after walking around the room a few hours so we had to keep our shoes on the entire time!!! 3  The location was good.
