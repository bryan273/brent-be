Preparing for the LSAT. Very few people achieve their full potential on the LSAT without some preparation. At a minimum, you should take a practice test, including the writing sample, under actual time constraints. This will help you estimate how much time you can afford to spend on each question, as well as which question types you should spend additional time practicing.
