The actress, who first signed on as Brittany S. Pierce in Season 1 of the Fox musical dramedy just to do a dance to Beyonce's Single Ladies with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) , does not have a deal for Season 5 of Glee, according to The Hollywood Reporter.ources told THR that Morris could potentially return for Glee Season 5 either as a regular or recurring guest star, the latter of which would be similar to the way the show handled Quinn (Dianna Agron), Mercedes (Amber Riley), Puck (Mark Salling) and Mike (Harry Shum Jr.) graduating after the Season 3 finale.
