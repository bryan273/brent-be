Tire pressure should be checked in the morning on cold tires, not after you've driven to Starbucks. Tire pressure changes 1 psi for every 10 degrees of outside temperature. A change from 70 F to 40 F will lower the pressure 3 psi, enough to affect wet braking and fuel economy; check your pressures monthly.
