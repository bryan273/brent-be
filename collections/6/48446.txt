Types of Congenital Heart Defects. With congenital heart defects, some part of the heart doesnâ€™t form properly before birth. This changes the normal flow of blood through the heart. There are many types of congenital heart defects. Some are simple, such as a hole in the septum. The hole allows blood from the left and right sides of the heart to mix. Another example of a simple defect is a narrowed valve that blocks blood flow to the lungs or other parts of the body.
