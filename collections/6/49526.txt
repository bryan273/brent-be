It takes forever for applications downloaded from Google Play to install. One app took over 1 hour to install. This is unacceptable. I have high speed internet access with a high speed dual band wireless Netgear R6 200 smart router.'m assuming it's the download that is taking so long. I'm used to my Droid Razr Maxx HD and the status bar showed the app as downloading. The S6 just shows a green progressing line scrolling across the screen for the app. I believe the the word installing shows up when it is installing.
