Many cars now feature daytime running lights or “always-on” headlights. These daytime lighting features reduce your risk in a crash by doubling your visibility to other drivers. They are so effective that many insurance companies will give a discount for vehicles that are equipped with them. If you do not have “always-on” lighting you need to know when your headlights are mandatory.
