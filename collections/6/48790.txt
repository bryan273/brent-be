Bake Until Opaque and Flaky. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F for fillets or 350 degrees F for a dressed fish. You can bake the fillets at a lower temperature, if desired, but remember to increase the cooking time. Bake salmon fillets or steaks, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness.For a dressed salmon, bake for 6 to 9 minutes per 8 ounces of fish. To test for doneness, insert a fork into the salmon and gently twist. The salmon is done as soon as it begins to flake. Be sure to test at the minimum baking time.ut larger pieces of salmon into serving-size pieces. Before seasoning your salmon, figure out the estimated cooking time. For fillets and steaks, use a ruler to measure the thickness. For a whole dressed fish (ready-to-cook salmon with the organs, scales, gills, and fins removed), weigh the fish instead.
