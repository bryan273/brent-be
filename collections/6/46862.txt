Definition of Factor Theorem. The factor theorem is a theorem linking factors and zeros of a polynomial. It is commonly applied to factorizing and finding the roots of polynomial equations. The theorem states that isa factor of a polynomial f (x)if ;that is, r is a root of f (x). Factor theorem problems are typically solved by applying synthetic division and then checking for a zero remainder.
