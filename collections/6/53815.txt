One drug costs $50 per dose. The other costs $2,000 per dose. Now, new research shows that the drug Avastin, normally used in cancer treatment, is just about as effective at treating an eye disease that can lead to blindness as the more commonly used and more expensive Lucentis.aguire and colleagues reported that Avastin delivered monthly cost an average of $595 and Lucentis cost $23,400. If the drugs were taken only as needed, rather than on a monthly basis, the cost dropped for both drugs, but Avastin was still the bargain choice: $385 for the year of treatment compared with $13,800.
