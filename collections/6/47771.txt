It's a different training. Psychiatrists go to 4 years of undergrad, then medical school for 4 years, and do 4-5 years of additional training in psychiatry, both in psychotherapy and in medication management. They have an MD and are medical doctors. Nurse practitioners have an NP degree and start out as nurses.
