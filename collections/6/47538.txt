Graduate certificates vs. master's degrees. A master's degree is typically a two-year, full-time commitment beyond a bachelor's degree in a field of study. Students can obtain a Master of Arts or Science or a degree that is more specialized, such as a master of social work, or MSW, or a Master of Business Administration, or MBA. On the other hand, a graduate certificate -- also called a diploma -- is a short program of study in a particular subject.
