Re: If x, y, and z are three-digit positive integers and if x = [#permalink] Tue Sep 18, 2012 8:13 pm. The concern here is the sum of the tenth digit might have a carryover, so the sum of the hundredth digit on Y & Z might not be equal to X's hundredth digit.47. 300. Here when we add the tens digits 5 and 4 and carry over 1 from the units place, we get 10, so we have carry over 1 from the tens place to the hundreds place, thus the hundreds digit of x (3) does NOT equal to the sum of the hundreds digits of y (1) and z (1).
