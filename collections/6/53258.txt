On March 15, 1995, Beaner's Coffee opened their first location at a former Arby's at 270 W. Grand River in East Lansing. Fish and Roszel then opened a second cafe in downtown Lansing in 1997. Fish, Roszel and Michael McFall (who was originally hired by Roszel as a barista in the first store) decided to franchise the company and founded Global Orange Development, LLC in June 1998.
