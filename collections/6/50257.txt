Wax is also sold in the newly opened marijuana shops in Colorado to customers who want a quicker, more intense buzz from pot. Because it is a concentrated form of the oils in marijuana, it delivers a potent dose of the active psychoactive ingredient, THC, to the user. Think of wax like 100 proof vodka vs. 50 proof. BHO is just another form of cannabis, despite the panic over the wax on the part of drug warriors. The only potential danger, according to experts, is in the manufacturing process. Butane, which is used to make wax, is highly flammable and sparks can set off an explosion.
