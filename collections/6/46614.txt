Each finger is provided with two interossei (palmar or dorsal), with the exception of the little finger, in which the abductor digiti minimi muscle takes the place of one of the dorsal interossei.The first dorsal interosseous muscle is larger than the others.ith some individual variations, the interossei muscles are attached either proximally or distally on the extensor expansion. The first dorsal interosseous, the most consistent, is inserted entirely into the base of its metacarpal and the extensor hood there.
