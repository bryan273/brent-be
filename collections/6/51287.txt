Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey. Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey. I'd heard about you before. I wanted to know some more. And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine. Oh, you make me dizzy. Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey. Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey.
