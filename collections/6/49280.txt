The beasts Daniel saw, as well as the first beast John saw in Revelation 13, arose out of turbulent seas. New nations usually arise by first overthrowing other nations, and then taking their place. However, there was no other nation overturned in order to make room for the United States. . .‚Äù (Revelation 13:3, KJV). This wounding of the papacy culminated in a series of events in 1798, right around the time the beast from the earth, the United States, was rising into power. The second beast which John sees in Revelation 13 is unique from all others because it arises out of the land.
