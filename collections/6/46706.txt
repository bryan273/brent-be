Sweden is one of the largest contributors to the United Nations and one of the few countries to meet the UNâ€™s aid target of 0.7 per cent of GNI (gross national income). Sweden became a member of the UN in 1946 and active involvement in the UN has been a central plank of Swedish foreign policy ever since.
