In January 1968, the NVA launched the Tet Offensive, capturing a number of towns in South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese lost 45,000 men, including many officers. Their morale was damaged - the offensive proved that they could not defeat the Americans by direct attack. It took the Americans a month to recover the towns. Their confidence was badly shaken.
