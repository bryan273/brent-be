Overall Rating: Arriving on Sunday night of a 3 day weekend, we were surprised to find an open spot. The tree-shaded sites are gravel with an additional leveled area for chairs and the picnic table. Our site 59 was almost level side to side but was not level front to back, which is to a concern to us.
