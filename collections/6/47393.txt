Olive trees have been grown in the Mediterranean for thousands of years and have supplied their growers with olives, olive oil and beauty. Olive trees grow in a wide variety of climatic conditions and will grow well in any area with hot, dry summers and mild winters. For those gardeners with harsh winter conditions, olive trees can be grown in containers and brought indoors for the winter.
