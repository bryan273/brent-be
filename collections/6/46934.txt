You might not even be able to see the fleas, but if your cat is sensitive, the bite of just one flea can cause a raging hot spot. Check your pet with a flea comb for fleas and flea dirt regularly. If your cat has a painful spot on her body and she starts licking and chewing at the area, she can create a hot spot.
