Catching the Academy Awards if you happen to be outside the U.S. on Oscar night can be a tricky proposition. ABC will be kicking off its extensive Oscar coverage Sunday night at 7 p.m. ET and 4 p.m. PT and will be offering, for the first time, a live stream for viewers to watch the Oscars online and via mobile devices. But for international Oscar fans, finding local live coverage of the 86th Academy Awards means maneuvering through a patchwork of satellite and cable broadcasters, as well as online offerings.
