These lizards however can also lose their tails, but it takes a much stronger pull to make this happen. With these types of lizards, the wound heals, but the tail does not grow back.   The main species that are capable of regrowing their tails are skinks and salamanders. So the answer may be that your blue tailed lizard (which is likely a blue tailed skink) will grow his tail back, it will just be a while.hen a lizard's tails fall off, it is their escape from a predator. It will take 3 months to 2 years to grow back, and it will have no pattern after it does so.
