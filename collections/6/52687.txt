May 20 11 10:53 AM. I would keep in contact with them ole Sarge to make sure they are on the ball. I received a decision on the first of May and I am also due 6 months back pay. Today is the 15th business day that they told me it takes to process the payment. I just checked my bank account and its still not there. I also did not receive any back pay when I first got my rating. I was awarded 60% for my back DDD back in May 2001 and was erroneously given a effective date of Mar 2000.
