Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD. The term chronic bronchitis is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years. Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role.
