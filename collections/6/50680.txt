Quick Answer. The primary distinction between a prairie and a savanna is the climate. Savannas, or tropical grasslands, cover almost half of the African continent and prefer warm or hot climates. Prairies, or temperate grasslands, prefer temperatures that vary from summer to winter. Prairies need less rainfall than savannas.
