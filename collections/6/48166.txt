Diindolylmethane, or DIM, is a phytochemical produced during the digestion of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower. Besides eating these vegetables, you can obtain DIM through supplements. DIM is produced from a chemical compound in the vegetables known as indole-3-carbinol or I3C. Much research has focused on I3C, but research on DIM itself is scant, according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, or MSKCC.
