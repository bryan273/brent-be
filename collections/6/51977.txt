Did not eat anything unusual. Thanks for your question. It is possible that you have an underlying medical condition that has been exacerbated (worsened) by the sodium you had consumed from the restaurant food. Some individuals experience edema (swelling) in their hands and feet after eating salt or high sodium foods. If the swelling does not go away, or if you are also experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain or decreased frequency of urination, I suggest you see your doctor ASAP. You may want to see him or her anyway as swelling after eating out at a restaurant is a bit abnormal.
