For many years scientists had been struggling to come up with patterns in the elements. German chemist, Johann Dobereiner, had noticed that some elements had similar properties. English chemist, John Newlands, arranged the first twenty elements in an order â€“ his law of octaves. However, a pattern couldn't be found for all the elements. Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev, arranged the elements in an order that we would now recognise.
