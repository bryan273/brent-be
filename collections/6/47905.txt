Plants produce sucrose during photosynthesis, making it the most abundant sugar in nature. Cane sugar and sugar beets are exceptionally rich sources, so their sucrose is extracted to produce granulated sugar. This is why you may know sucrose better by the name table sugar. Sucrose in any form gives you a boost of energy, but it's only healthy when it comes from natural fruits and vegetables.
