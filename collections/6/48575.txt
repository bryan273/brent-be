3. ER without ribosomes is called smooth endoplasmic reticulum and contains enzymes for lipid biosynthesis, especially the synthesis of phospholipids and steroids. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum forms transition vesicles to transfer molecules produced in the rough ER to the Golgi complex.) provide a surface area for protein and lipid synthesis; 2) form a pathway for transporting molecules within the cell; and 3) provide a storage area for molecules the cell has synthesized. 1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum ER with ribosomes attached is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 31, Fig.
