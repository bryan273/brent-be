The 757-200 will generally touchdown with a speed of around 125 kts. The 767 is about 10 knots faster than this. Depends on how you define commercial. Two seat Cessna 152 used by a flight school for instruction is technically commercial and its landing speed is around 60 knots. An airliner such as Boeing 777 or a corporate jet such as Citation usually touches down around 150ish knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).
