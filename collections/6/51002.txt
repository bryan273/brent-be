Craniotomy is any bony opening that is cut into the skull (cranium) to access the brain underneath. There are many types of craniotomies, which are named according to the area of skull to be removed (Fig. 1). Typically the bone flap is replaced. If the bone flap is not replaced, the procedure is called a craniectomy.
