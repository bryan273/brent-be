Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend Tyga may have just gotten one pricy pup. Jenner debuted the dog in a series of Snapchat pictures and videos on Thursday with dollar signs and the caption “50K,” which seem to indicate the animal’s super-high price tag. The puppy – an adorable scrunch-faced, tri-colored Merle English Bulldog named Rolly – played with Jenner’s three other dogs in the videos.
