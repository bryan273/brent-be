Most transform faults are underwater, but the San Andreas Fault is one of the few that is exposed on land. Transform faults have shallow earthquakes that are often quite damaging on land. The San Andreas Fault connects two divergent fault boundaries in the north and south. It runs most of the length of California and into the ocean. Transform fault boundaries are one of three primary plate boundary types. The other two are divergent boundaries and convergent boundaries. Learn more about Plate Tectonics
