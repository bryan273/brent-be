I would like to know if I can buy CS GO Crate keys at a site, not ingame. Like TF2(http://store.teamfortress.com/) and Dota2(http://www.dota2.com/store/) have. Edit: Not the market and no illegal sites. Last edited by edchaos: 08-22-2013 at 06:13 AM. want to know if CS Go also have it, and what is its link. I want to buy cs go crate keys that are sold ingame, but without having to run the game.
