Our Viking axes recreate a variety of one and two handed designs, all made with steel heads. Some are stainless steel and made to recreate the design in a decorative fashion. A majority of others, though, are made in carbon steel and forged steel, recreating the Viking axe in truth, one as simple as it is effective.
