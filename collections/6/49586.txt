Answer Wiki. An LED driver is needed to run LED's properly. Unlike most electronic devices, LED's are current driven devices, not voltage driven ones. Even a minuscule change in voltage can lead to a huge change in current. Hence, it is important that the drive current is regulated and not the voltage. LED drivers are usually switching mode devices that convert the input voltage (Typically 120-220 VAC or 12 VDC) into a voltage at which the current drawn by the LED's is equal to its drive current.
