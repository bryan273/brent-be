At the grocery store, pick up your raw chicken last, just before you head to the check-out line. And have the checker wrap the chicken in a plastic bag in case the package leaks. A whole cooked chicken can be kept in the refrigerator for 3 days; cut-up cooked chicken can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. Never leave raw or frozen chicken at room temperature, which encourages the growth of bacteria like Salmonella and Listeria.
