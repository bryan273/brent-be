Let’s say that you type 10 into cell A2, and you then apply the percentage number format. Because Excel multiples your number by 100 to show it as a percentage (remember that 1% is one part of one hundred), you’ll see 1000% displayed in the cell, not 10%. To get around this, you can calculate your numbers as percentages first. For example, if you type the formula =10/100 in cell A2, Excel will display the result as 0.1. If you then format that decimal as a percentage, the number will be displayed as 10%, as you ‘d expect.
