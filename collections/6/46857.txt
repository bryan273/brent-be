The remainder here is zero because we have completely divided through P(x) by the factor (x - 1) . When you reach this step, you're done, dividing any further by zero would result in zero. Now lets try to use the remainder theorem to find a value of P(-1) , to see what we result with. We already know that x = -1 is not a root of the polynomial P(x). The first step is the same as in the previous example; arrange the divisor and dividend on the outside and inside of the division bar respectively.
