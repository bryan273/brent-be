Minimum Driving Age. To hire a car in Trinidad and Tobago you must have held a licence for a minimum of two years and be at least 25 years of age. The minimum driving age however is only 17. It's not illegal to use a camera detector although it's best to abide by the speed limits anyway, negating the need for one.
