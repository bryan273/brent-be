The film famously took its inspiration from an event that became the stuff of legend: Butch Cassidyâ€™s 1900 train heist, which ended with Cassidy blowing open a safe and escaping with $5,000 in cash. Starting in the 1920s, John Wayne began shooting the first of many Westerns and took the genre to new heights.
