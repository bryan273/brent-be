In January 2016, Briggs released the single River and changed her recording name to Bishop Briggs to avoid confusion with a heavy metal band of the same name. The song was a commercial success. Shortly after its release, the song quickly made it to number 1 on Hype Machine's Popular charts and reached number 1 on Spotify's US Viral 50 and #2 on the Global Viral 50.
