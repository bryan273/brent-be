The Acropolis of Athens by Leo von Klenze. A democracy is of political system, or a system of decision-making within an institution, or organization, in which all members have the equal share to power. Systems of democracy stand in contrast to other forms of government, including monarchy and oligarchy. Democracy can be traced back from the present day to classical Athens and Greeks in the 6th century B.C.E. In a modern representative democracy, this formal equality is embodied primarily in the right to vote.
