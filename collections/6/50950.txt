Chiral centers are atoms, usually C, bonded to four different groups. Stereoisomers that differ in the direction they rotate a plane of polarized light are called optically active, or chiral, and their isomers are called enantiomers.All enantiomers are stereoisomers but not all stereoisomers are enantiomers.Enantiomers rotate the plane of polarized light – one enantiomer to the left the other to the right. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomer (or diastereoisomer) are molecules that possesses more than one chiral center.ll enantiomers are stereoisomers but not all stereoisomers are enantiomers.
