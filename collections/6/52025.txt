And if I ever lose my eyes, if my colours all run dry, Yes if I ever lose my eyes, Oh if I won't have to cry no more. Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow, moon shadow, moonshadow---. Leapin and hoppin' on a moonshadow, moonshadow, moonshadow---. And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my land, Oh if I ever lose my hands, Oh if I won't have to work no more.
