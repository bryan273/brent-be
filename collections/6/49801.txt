Next, compare the color of your pH test paper to the color chart. While the color may not be an exact match to the chart, you should choose the color your test result most closely resembles. Normal vaginal pH is 3.8 to 4.5, which is slightly acidic. The home vaginal pH test kit measures pH on a scale of 1 to 14. Abnormal vaginal pH may be higher or lower than normal vaginal pH. High vaginal pH numbers indicate less acidity, while lower than normal vaginal pH levels indicate high acidity. Abnormal vaginal pH frequently indicates the presence of a vaginal infection.
