This is probably the most common dairy intolerance problem- the inability to break down lactose, so that your body can assimilate it. Lactase is the enzyme that digests the milk sugar lactose. If lactose remains in a dairy product you need to have this enzyme present to metabolize this sugar. Lactase can be produced by certain cells that line your digestive tract. However, many people are unable to produce lactase.
