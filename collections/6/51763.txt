The ankle bones. The ankle is the area where the leg attaches to the foot. The distal ends of the tibia and fibula are part of the ankle. The tibia is the larger medial (toward the midline of the body) bone. It has a facet on the distal end that articulates with the talus. The medial malleolus is a projection that you can palpate.
