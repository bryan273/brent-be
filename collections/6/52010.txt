Some women wear headscarves, wigs, and pencil on eyebrows. There is nothing you can do to prevent hair loss during chemotherapy. However, hair loss is temporary and will start to grow back in a few months after chemotherapy treatment. Your hair may grow back with a different color, texture, or consistency. The best thing to do is let your hair grow out naturally and then think about dying, straightening, or perming it after you are completely finished with the treatment.
