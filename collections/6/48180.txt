In glycolysis, glucose (a six carbon sugar) is split into two molecules of the three-carbon sugar pyruvate. This multi-step process yields two molecules of ATP (free energy containing molecule), two molecules of pyruvate, and two high energy electron carrying molecules of NADH. Glycolysis can occur with or without oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration. In the abscence of oxygen, glycolysis allows cells to make small amounts of ATP through the process of fermentation. Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol of the cell's cytoplasm. However, the next stage of cellular respiration known as the citric acid cycle, occurs in the matrix of cell mitochondria. Below are the 10 steps of glycolysis: Step 1
