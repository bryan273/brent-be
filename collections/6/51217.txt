Sorry to confuse you with the motor...I'm used to hanging out in Z forums where you say L28 and everybody knows exactly what you mean. I guess in a 'general' Nissan forum, L28 doesn't mean anything....Thanks for the weight info though...2700 is about the same as my 280Z (with an L28 in it.) steve77z.
