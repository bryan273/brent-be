Anatomy and supply. The palmar interossei are three muscles located in the metacarpus. They arise from the metacarpal bones of the index, ring and little finger. The origin surfaces of these muscles are facing towards the middle finger:1  Palmar interosseous muscle I: ulnar side of the index finger.unctionally, the palmar interossei act antagonistically to the dorsal interossei in the MCP (mnemonic: DAB = Dorsals ABduct, PAD = Palmars ADduct). However both muscle groups perform common functions, as they flex the fingers in the MCP and extend in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (PIP and DIP).
