Prior restraint is the censorship of speech by the government before the speech is published, distributed, or otherwise heard or read. The right to free speech (also known as 'free expression') is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the government from making any law 'abridging the freedom of speech.'
