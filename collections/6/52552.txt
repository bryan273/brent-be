It can happen if you touch a cold sore, then touch an area of broken skin or a mucous membrane (that’s the moist, protective lining found in places where your body opens to the outside -- mouth, nose, genitals). That can lead to a herpes skin infection. To prevent this, wash your hands and don’t touch the cold sore.
