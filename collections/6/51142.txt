Where do midges live? The Highland Midge prefers to lay its eggs in slightly acidic habitats, typically peaty soils containing favourite plants like rushes. When theyâ€™re not biting they like to hide in long bracken, or amongst moss on tree bark. This type of habitat dominates western areas of Scotland.
