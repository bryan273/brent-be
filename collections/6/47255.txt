So I could sum up the needs of one person diagnosed as close to death, me, as being: 1  The need to settle up with the people that I felt close to, so as to die in peace, with them and with myself. 2  The need to have someone to stand in for me, to do what I could not do when I became helpless or consigned to the grave. The need for places and organizations that I could turn to for practical information. 2  The need for someone to guide me, or go with me, round this new and unfamiliar domain of the terminal state-not necessarily the same someone for every sector of it.
