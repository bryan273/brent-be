The right atrium receives de-oxygenated blood from the body through the superior vena cava (head and upper body) and inferior vena cava (legs and lower torso). The sinoatrial node sends an impulse that causes the cardiac muscle tissue of the atrium to contract in a coordinated, wave-like manner.he blood leaving the left ventricle exits through the aorta, the bodyâ€™s main artery. Two coronary arteries, referred to as the left and right coronary arteries, emerge from the beginning of the aorta, near the top of the heart.
