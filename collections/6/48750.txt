Most landlords won't let you drill a ton of holes in the wall so you can mount your TV to the wall.he main advantage of this solution is hiding the cables. I think the idea that the landlord would care less about attaching a fake wall than about drilling holes in the existing wall to mount a TV is phony. Either way, you are doing some significant modifications.
