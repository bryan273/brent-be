Exploring XOR Decryption Methods. February 11, 2014. The use of XOR encryption to keep anti-virus, web filters, and even researchers at-bay have been used for many years.

Converter has four ways to help you figure out what the XOR key is. For a single XOR key, you can use Converterâ€™s Key Search/Convert.
