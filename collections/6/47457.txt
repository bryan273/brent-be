Fatigue can be associated with anemia. Anemia would show up on your CBC as a decreased in RBC's or hemoglobin, a protein, which enables RBC's to carry oxygen throughout the body. Normal hemoglobin levels are 12-16 g/dL for women and 14-18 g/dL for men. So if your hemoglobin level and RBC counts are normal, you are not anemic.
