Dead head or prune any stems with dead flowers on healthy orchids. Use a pair of sharp pruning shears to cut off the stem just below the lowest bloom and just above the nearest node (the joint or swollen area on the stem that produces new flowers). If your orchid is healthy, this may stimulate it to produce new blooms from the node.
