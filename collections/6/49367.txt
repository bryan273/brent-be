Nominal vs. Actual. The label put on the lumber you buy is called the “nominal” lumber size. The actual size is always a little bit smaller. Nominal refers to the dimension the lumber was sawn. When a 2×4 is cut out of a log it is 2″x4″. After the board is dried and planed it becomes its actual size of 1 1/2″x3 1/2″.
