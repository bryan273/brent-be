Studies have indicated that CRP may be elevated with heart attacks. It is yet to be determined if CRP serves as a marker of heart disease or whether it plays a part in causing atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries). There is also a high-sensitivity CRP test (hs-CRP), in addition to the regular CRP test.
