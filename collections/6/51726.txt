Our honeymoon was fun, it was enjoyable, it was a REAL honeymoon! We had adventures, we ate … A LOT! We drank, we danced, we swam, we kissed, we had sexy time, we shared, we became a couple … and at this point, I have high hopes for my marriage. Married at First Sight airs Tuesdays (9 p.m. ET) on FYI.
