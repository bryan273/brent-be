Description: Galena is formed in a wide range of hydrothermal environments. It can be found with sphalerite and chalcopyrite in massive sulfide deposits associated with meta-volcanic rocks, such as the Crandon deposit near Rhinelander. It is a component of some pegmatites and granites, as reported in the Wausau region.
