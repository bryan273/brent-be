If you want to edit the hosts file, you first need to locate and open it - on Vista and newer with UAC enabled from an elevated process (with admin rights). The procedure is a little tedious. Here is how to do it with 64-bit Notepad: Click on the Start button, type notepad and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. Acknowledge the UAC dialog. Type CTRL+O. Navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. Select All Files in the bottom right corner. Now you see the hosts file.
