And which wines have less calories or more carbs may surprise you. Wine might seem like a weight loss friendly drink, especially compared to beer. But you would be surprised by how many calories wine makers can cram into a 750 ml bottle. Some bottles of wine contain 650 calories per bottle. That might not seem like a lot. But when most people only consume 2,000 to 2,700 calories per day, two glasses of wine can add up fast over the course of a meal. Plus there's the whole issue of how many glasses of wine there are in a bottle of wine. I was always taught there are four glasses of wine in each wine bottle.
