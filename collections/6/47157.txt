The function f is defined for each positive three-digit integer n by f(n) = 2x 3y 5z, where x, y and z are the hundreds, tens, and units digits of n, respectively. If m and v are three-digit positive integers such that f(m) = 9 f(v), then m-v =.he ways it's written, it looks like a 3 digit number. 2) if it is, then it cannot be defined for EACH positive three digit integer as the question states. But I agree with one of the answerer's above. If f(n) is really defined as 2^x * 3^y * 5^z, then you can solve it.
