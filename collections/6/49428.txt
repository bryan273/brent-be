How to Become a USA Citizen Naturalization is the way immigrants become Citizens of the United States. If you were not born a citizen, you become one through naturalization. Citizenship is a lifetime benefit bestowed upon you. As a citizen, you get unique rights and privileges which include the right to vote, having a U.S. passport, the U.S. government's protection when abroad and the right to petition for green cards for your children and close relatives.
