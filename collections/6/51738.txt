Bowel habits, including the number of times a person passes stool each day, their volume, and their consistency vary from individual to individual. Because of this, precise criteria for frequent bowel movements do not exist. Having frequent bowel movements means that you are having more bowel movements than is normal for you. Often, frequent bowel movements are accompanied by diarrhea, the passage of loosely formed stool. Diarrhea is a common condition. Adults in the United States average one episode of diarrhea per year, and children average two bouts per year (Source: NDDIC).
