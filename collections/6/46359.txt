When you’re buying new furniture, you can pay extra — $60 to $150 at most retailers, depending on the size of the sofa, to get your furniture pre-treated with a fabric protector. If you go the DIY route, you can expect to pay between $6 and $13 per can for a stain protector, such as Scotchgard, at most major stores.
