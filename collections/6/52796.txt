A transaction of sale and purchase is only valid if the title documents are valid. DMV asserts strongly that no delay should be made in replacing the car titles or transferring them when a car is bought or sold. Once the car becomes your property, there should be legal proof of that. Many states have a policy that car title transfers should be done within ten days of the transaction.
