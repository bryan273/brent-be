â€¢ Mark Cuban previously said Bitcoin is a bubble; he now backs a cryptocurrency fund. More money going into Bitcoin means the price has to go up. People will continue to buy Bitcoin if the prospects for its future growth look good. My bet is that big money is already quietly moving money into the currency, and very soon more and more mainstream news outlets will start covering the cryptocurrency.
