Although scientists don't completely understand how lizards regenerate their tails, they know lizards are capable of dedifferentiating cells. This means existing cells at the base of the tail, or the base of the break along the tail, revert back to a more primitive cell, similar to a stem cell.erves. Nerves seem to play a critical role in the regrowth of lizard tails. Lizards who have nerve damage at the base of the tail as their tails drop aren't able to regenerate the tails.
