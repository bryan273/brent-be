Why does my car squeak when I turn the steering wheel? Just tonight My front right wheel rammed into the side of a curb that jutted out unevenly, causing the hub cap to get displaced. I have to fix the hubcap of the tire and put it back on right. However, now whenever I turn the steering wheel the car makes squeaking noises. This never happened before I bumped the wheel on the curb.
