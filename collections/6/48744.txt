So, you'll make a foundation, drill on some drywall, and make it look exactly like the actual wall in your apartment. Then, you'll go ahead and drill a hole to hide wires, mount the fake wall to your real wall, and mount the TV just as you would if you owned the place.he main advantage of this solution is hiding the cables. I think the idea that the landlord would care less about attaching a fake wall than about drilling holes in the existing wall to mount a TV is phony. Either way, you are doing some significant modifications.
