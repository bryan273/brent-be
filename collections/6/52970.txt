* For a wire transfer, device must be a Galaxy device with Android™ 4.3 or higher, iOS 5 or higher, or BlackBerry® 7 OS or lower. Other devices are not supported for a wire transfer and must use the Smart Switch wireless transfer option or download the Kies app. If you do not have the USB cable from your old phone or the USB connector for a wired transfer to a GS7 or Note7, then you may use the wireless options.
