Why do some say to cook chicken to 160°F and others to 170° or 180°? This goes to the very heart of the liberal/conservative debate — and, as you can imagine, its not pretty. Our government says that you should cook a whole chicken until the temperature measured in the thigh is 180°F (82°C). If you cook chicken pieces, the government says, the thigh, wings, and drumsticks should be 180°F, while the breast should reach 170°F (77°C).
