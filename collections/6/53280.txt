By 1835, enough people had settled in north-central Arkansas to petition for a separate county. On November 5, 1835, the legislature established Searcy County from western Izard County. This original Searcy County now comprises Marion, Searcy, and parts of Boone, Baxter, and Stone counties. The county was named for Richard Searcy (1792â€“1832), prominent civil servant, major landowner, and circuit court judge.
