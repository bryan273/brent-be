Find the inverse, its domain and range, of the function given by. 1  Let us first find the domain and range of the given function. 2  Range of f: (-∞,+∞). 3  Write f as an equation, change from logarithmic to exponential form.4  y = 3 Ln(4 x - 6) - 2.5  which gives Ln(4 x - 6) = (y + 2) / 3. 6  Change from logarithmic to exponential form.ind the inverse, its domain and range, of the function given by. 1  Let us first find the domain and range of the given function. 2  Range of f: (-∞,+∞). 3  Write f as an equation, change from logarithmic to exponential form.
