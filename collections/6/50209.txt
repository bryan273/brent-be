Naming binary (two-element) covalent compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds. The first element in the formula is simply listed using the name of the element. The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix-ide.A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 4.1 Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds lists these numerical prefixes.Normally, no prefix is added to the first element’s name if there is only one atom of the first element in a molecule. system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 4.1 Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds lists these numerical prefixes. Normally, no prefix is added to the first element’s name if there is only one atom of the first element in a molecule.
