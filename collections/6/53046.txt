Involuntary Dissolution. A corporation can be involuntarily dissolved by court order when one of the corporation's shareholders files a lawsuit requesting dissolution. This situation typically occurs when the relationship among one or more shareholders becomes acrimonious and effectively prevents operation of the corporation's business.
