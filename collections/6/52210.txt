I walk about 5 miles a day and it doesn't do anything for me. Just walking one mile a day will not do much good. For it to do any good, you have to walk for an hour (3 miles) at a very brisk pace. Walking a mile a day wouldnt do very much for you, but walking for about two hours should let you burn many calories.
