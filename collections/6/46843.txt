High-beams are to be turned off when another vehicle is in front of you or approaching on the opposite side of the road. Most of the states require that you switch to low-beams 500 ft. or more from oncoming vehicles. Consult your state's Drivers Handbook for details. The switch for headlights varies between vehicles. Consult your car's owner manual to make sure you know exactly how to turn your headlights on. Each vehicle must also have taillights and brake lights. Most of the states require that the taillights be visible from 500 ft.
