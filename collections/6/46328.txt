Plant three to five papaya seeds in each pot, about 1 inch deep and 3 or more inches apart from one another. Set the pots out in an area that receives full sunlight. Wait two to five weeks for the seeds to germinate. Choose your outdoor planting site, which should be in full sunlight and in a warm area of the yard.
