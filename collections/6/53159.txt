Draft the Document. Drafting a power of attorney can be as simple as visiting your stateâ€™s website or your local courthouse. Most states have statutory forms for such documents. If you decide to draft your own, you might want to take it to a lawyer for review before you sign it to make sure it really does express your intentions.
