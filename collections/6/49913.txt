GameStop has strict regular hours of operation. On Monday thru Saturday, GameStop is open from 10:00 AM until 9:00 PM. Most locations are open, but you have to be careful. The hours are different from the typical weekday schedule, so it can be tricky to find out when does GameStop open on Sunday. As most don’t even open until noon (12:00 PM), don’t try to head out and catch them early in the morning. You also can’t be too late, since a typical location will close early.
