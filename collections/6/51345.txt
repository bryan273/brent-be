I use one. Yes, most of the oil is absorbed by the popcorn, but olive oil is a good oil for you. Just a tablespoon and a serving of popcorn is going to be very low calorie. I think I use a 1/4 cup popcorn kernels and a tablespoon of olive oil and it's around 250-300 calories for the whole bowl. It's a good snack!
