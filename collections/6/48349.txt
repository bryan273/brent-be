What is a source document? A source document is the original record containing the details to substantiate a transaction entered in an accounting system. For example, a company's source document for the recording of merchandise purchased is the supplier's invoice supported by the company's purchase order and receiving ticket. A company's source documents for its weekly payroll are the employees' time cards.
