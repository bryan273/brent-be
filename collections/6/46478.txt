In women, the monthly menstrual cycle sometimes causes edema, but this does not need treatment. Side effects of medications for hypertension or diabetes may at times cause edema in patients. Congestive heart failure is the most serious condition that causes edema in the chest; it may also cause death. Swellings on the lower legs or around the eyes may be the result of kidney disease.
