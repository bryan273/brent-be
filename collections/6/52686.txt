For most disability claimants, it takes many months or even years waiting to get through the Social Security disability system, and by that time, many applicants are in debt. Usually, a claimant will receive their backpay (or the first installment of their backpay) within 60 days of being approved. But it doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes the backpay comes very quickly. In fact, numerous times I've seen backpay deposited to a bank account before an award notice is even sent.
