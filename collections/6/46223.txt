The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the shape maps onto itself during a rotation of 360°. e.g. A rectangle has order of rotational symmetry of 2. 180° and 360° rotations will map it onto itself. A regular hexagon has order of rotational symmetry of 6. A scalene triangle, with no equal sides or angles has order of rotational symmetry of 1. All figures have an order of rotational symmetry of at least 1.
