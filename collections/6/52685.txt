When you are trying to figure how many months of back pay you will receive, count up the number of full calendar months between when your disability began and when you expect your first check. Then subtract five months. You have to subtract five months because Social Security does not pay the first five full calendar months of disability. Another thing to keep in mind is that Social Security pays for the prior month, not for the month in which you receive the payment.
