Since you can only use an analog watch at the real LSAT, time your practice tests with an analog watch (ideally the same one you will use on the real LSAT). For $15, you can even buy a DVD that has a virtual proctor that will do and say the same things as the proctors at the actual LSAT (lsatproctor.com).
