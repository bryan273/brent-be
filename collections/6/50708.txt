Vail operates nine mountain resorts and two ski areas in the U.S. and Australia, making Whistler Blackcomb its first foray into Canada. Two years ago, Vail bought Utah's Park City Mountain Resort for US$182.5 million and merged it with a neighbouring resort. Markets responded extremely well to news of the most recent deal, as Whistler Blackcomb's stock shot up more than 45 per cent by closing on Monday.
