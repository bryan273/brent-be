PRO reviews and opinions. 1  Works great on any bare floor, from tiles to marble and laminated wood. 2  I own 2 sheddy dogs. 3  The easiest assembly ever. 4  A gallon of distilled water is just $1 at the grocery, which works great with my budget. 5  The microfiber pads are easy to wash and plushy, so they donâ€™t scratch my hardwood floor.
