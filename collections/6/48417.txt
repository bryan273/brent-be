PRO reviews and opinions. 1  Works great on any bare floor, from tiles to marble and laminated wood. I absolutely love it and would definitely buy it again. 2  I own 2 sheddy dogs. So far, this product does wonders. 3  The easiest assembly ever. Iâ€™ve done it in less than 5 minutes, while drinking my coffee.
