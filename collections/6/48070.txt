Business Description. Harry and Sigmund Weis founded Weis Markets in 1912 when the two entrepreneurs opened a small neighborhood store known as Weis Pure Foods on Market Street in Sunbury, Pa. They were among the first grocers to sell goods on a cash-and-carry basis during a time when most stores sold goods on credit.
