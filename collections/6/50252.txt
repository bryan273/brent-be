Wax is a brownish substance of concentrated THC. THC is the primary cannabinoid, or psychoactive substance, found in the cannabis plant. Typical marijuana is simply the dried buds of the plant. The user smokes or consumes these buds and gets a high from the THC and other cannabinoid compounds. Cannabis growers make wax by extracting THC from the leaves of the plants, which they would normally throw away. The result is a substance that is 10 to 20 times more potent than typical marijuana and can be 60 percent to 90 percent THC. It takes just a small amount of wax for a user to get high, which means that it is a form of the drug that is easier to hide, to transport, and to use without being noticed.
