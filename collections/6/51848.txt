Similarly, a decrease in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide tends to increase precipitation. The results of this study show that cutting the concentration of precipitation-suppressing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase global precipitation. This is important because scientists are concerned that unchecked global warming could cause already dry areas to get drier.
