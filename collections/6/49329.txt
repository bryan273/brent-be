Do elements, mixtures and compounds consist of atoms or molecules ? Answer in words: Elements can consist of either atoms or molecules but if molecules then those molecules are formed only from atoms of the same type (that is, atoms of the same element). For example, a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and has the chemical formula O 2 where O is the chemical symbol of the element oxygen.
