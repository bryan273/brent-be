The lipid bilayer is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules.These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells.The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures.ome molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical.
