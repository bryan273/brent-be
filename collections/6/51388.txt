When working as a private investigator/qualified manager, you may not carry a gun on duty without a valid firearm permit issued by the Bureau or a screen print of the Bureau's approval obtained from the Bureau's web site. Also, a firearm permit issued by the Bureau does not authorize you to carry a concealed weapon.
