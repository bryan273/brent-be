Verdolagas (purslane) in salsa verde. Verdolagas, called purslane in English, are a popular edible green in Central Mexico. They're most commonly stewed with cubes of pork in tomatillo sauce, until the leaves are limp and soft. I've been a bit scared to try them -- I've met two people so far who absolutely hate verdolagas.
