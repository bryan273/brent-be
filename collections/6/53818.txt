1 For wet macular degeneration, in which a cluster of leaky blood vessels forms in the eye, a doctor might prescribe injections into the eye with bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), a chemotherapy drug that is used off-label, or pegaptanib (brand name Macugen) or ranibizumab (brand name Lucentis). For patients not covered by health insurance, treatment for macular degeneration typically costs about $9,000-$65,000, depending on which drug is used, for a two-year course of treatment with drugs injected into the eye to inhibit formation of and leakage from excess blood vessels.
