The direct OP is the classic posterior position with the baby facing straight forward. Right Occiput Transverse (ROT) is a common starting position in which the baby has a bit more likelihood of rotating to the posterior during labor than to the anterior. Right Occiput Posterior usually involves a straight back with a lifted chin (in the first-time mother). Left Occiput Posterior places the babyâ€™s back opposite the maternal liver and may let the baby flex (curl) his or her back and therefore tuck the chin for a better birth. These are generalities, of course.
