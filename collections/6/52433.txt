Have an orange tree with two varieties of oranges. One edible with seeds and the other from the top, bitter. Also have a lemon tree with two varieties. One like a Meyer with thin skin but the other has a thick rind and is quite large (Both trees have thorns).ave an orange tree with two varieties of oranges.
