Lemons are generally more sour than limes because lemons contain more citric acid and sweet limes lack citric acid. The scientific name for lemons is Citrus limon. They are oval in shape and have a very tart, acidic flavor. The two main types of lemons consumers are familiar with are the eureka and Lisbon varieties.
