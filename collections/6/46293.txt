If a gecko drops its tail, the blood vessels to the tail will constrict, so very little blood loss occurs. Eventually, the gecko will grow a new tail, though it is likely to have a different appearance than the original tail.The photo on the right shows a gecko I spotted at an outdoor restaurant that appears to have regrown its tail (their tails are normally the same bright green/turquoise as on the body).f course, if you try to grab your gecko by the tail, the same thing is likely to happen. Why a Gecko Drops Its Tail. Being grabbed or threatened aren't the only reasons a gecko might drop its tail.
