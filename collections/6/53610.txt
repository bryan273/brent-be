Hi Mark , 16730 seems to be the Fender part number for the plastic piece but not the actual pickup assembly . I googled Fender 016730 and found that number referenced for 80's Strats on up . I just looked at the pickups I pulled out of a brand new American std yesterday . The bottem of the bobbin is marked 016730 !
