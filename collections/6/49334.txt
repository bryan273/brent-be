Withdrawal from LSD does not cause physical withdrawal symptoms. Because of this, the user can stop using LSD abruptly without experiencing negative physical effects, such as drug cravings or physical discomfort. However, the user may become depressed or unhappy upon quitting LSD because of a psychological addiction.
