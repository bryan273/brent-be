Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually occurs in older adults. The average age of person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different than other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. The drainage of CSF is blocked gradually, and the excess fluid builds up slowly.
