All versions easily accommodates a large water bath canner OR a pressure canner. I use it for canning, camping, and when the power goes out! Each model puts out 10,000 btu per burner (20,000, total per stove). I recommend the versions withOUT the griddle, as you will be sure the burners are the same height!
