My reaction to the book reminds me of when you find a great first album by an up and coming band and you are real Cross Roads, by Wm. Paul Young, is similar to his first book The Shack in that the Holy Trinity has a starring role in the book. Young uses this device effectively in The Shack, but perhaps it is just a tad tiresome when he uses it again in this book.
