Special Acceptance Events. Find a Special Passport Acceptance Event near you! We're holding special acceptance events all across the United States this Spring to help you get your passport more easily. Most events are for first-time and children applicants, (who use Form DS-11). If you can use Form DS-82, you can renew by mail at your convenience!
