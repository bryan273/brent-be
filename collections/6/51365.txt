Bone connective tissue provides structure and support, adipose (or fat) connective tissue insulates and provides energy, and blood connective tissue distributes oxygen to our tissues and removes carbon dioxide. Another integral type of connective tissue is cartilage. The main structural components of our bodies are bone, muscle, and cartilage. Bones are rigid, while muscles bend, stretch, and are flexible. Cartilage connective tissue is the perfect halfway point between these other tissues. It is not as rigid or as hard as bone, and it is also less flexible than muscle.
