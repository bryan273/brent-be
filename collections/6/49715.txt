The economic value of the Emu is dependent upon the oil, meat, and hide. At market age (15-18 months), an emu can yield approximately five liters of oil. This oil is an unsaturated fat and is currently being used in skin care products and topical arthritis creams. Emu meat is low in fat and cholesterol. In a 100 gram (or 3.5 ounce) serving, emu meat consists of 23.3 g of protein, 109 calories, 57.5 mg of cholesterol, 1.7 g of fat, and .6 g of saturated fat. Emu leather is a fine-grained hide that is being used by the fashion garment industry in Europe.
