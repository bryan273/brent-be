1) is f(n) necessarily a 3 digit number. The ways it's written, it looks like a 3 digit number. 2) if it is, then it cannot be defined for EACH positive three digit integer as the question states. But I agree with one of the answerer's above. If f(n) is really defined as 2^x * 3^y * 5^z, then you can solve it.he ways it's written, it looks like a 3 digit number. 2) if it is, then it cannot be defined for EACH positive three digit integer as the question states.
