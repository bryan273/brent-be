A dose of Avastin -- used off-label for this purpose, as the drug is currently approved only for cancer indications -- costs about $50 whereas a dose of Ludentis, which is approved for AMD, costs about $2,000.aguire and colleagues reported that Avastin delivered monthly cost an average of $595 and Lucentis cost $23,400. If the drugs were taken only as needed, rather than on a monthly basis, the cost dropped for both drugs, but Avastin was still the bargain choice: $385 for the year of treatment compared with $13,800.
