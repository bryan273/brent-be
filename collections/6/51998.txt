Adrienne's moderately low voice for the role was rather fitting for Raven as her performance did suit Raven Melancholic nature. Granted while Adrienne didn't have as much material as Tara did but Adrienne was able to do some pretty good work with Raven and is a good example of the voice work in that game.
