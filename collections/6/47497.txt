In general, fasting 6 to 12 hours before a blood draw is optimal. If lipemia persists after fasting for 24 hours it indicates problems with fat metabolism. If the purpose of the blood test is to evaluate the effect of dietary modification on a disease process, blood should be drawn 2 to 6 hours after food consumption. If you are reevaluating the thyroid levels of a dog already receiving supplementation, blood should be drawn 4 to 6 hours after the morning pill.
