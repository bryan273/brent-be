Note: We will primarily be talking about Bitcoin mining here. When the Bitcoin mining software wants to add a new block to the blockchain, this is the procedure it follows. Whenever a new block arrives, all the contents of the blocks are first hashed. If the hash is lesser than the difficulty target, then it is added to the blockchain and everyone in the community acknowledges the new block.
