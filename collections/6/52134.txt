Since other orchid varieties will not bloom again from the same flower spike, you can cut their spikes back to the base of plants after flowers fall. After flowers fall off, use a sterile razor blade to cut the flower spike and discard the tool after a single use. Optionally, you can disinfect a cutting tool with alcohol or flame it to kill germs.
