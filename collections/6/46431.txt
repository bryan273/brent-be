Require mail to be transmitted via a secure (TLS) connection. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a security protocol that encrypts email to protect its privacy. TLS is the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Gmail uses TLS by default, but when a secure connection isn't available (both sender and recipient need to use TLS to create a secure connection), Gmail will deliver messages over non-secure connections.
