We've said it before and we'll say it again: This is a myth for the vast majority of modern cars. The 3,000-mile oil change is the credo of the quick-oil change industry and dealership service departments, designed to regularly get you into the service bay. (Jiffy Lube recently abandoned its advocacy of the 3,000-mile rule, but clings to severe-schedule advice with which Edmunds disagrees. More on this later.)
