Current literature assumes that there are three palmar interossei. Nevertheless, in 1858 the German anatomist Henle has described a fourth palmar interosseous between the thumb and the index finger (palmar interosseous of Henle).unctionally, the palmar interossei act antagonistically to the dorsal interossei in the MCP (mnemonic: DAB = Dorsals ABduct, PAD = Palmars ADduct). However both muscle groups perform common functions, as they flex the fingers in the MCP and extend in the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (PIP and DIP).
