People who are not current members of those programs can apply anytime to get the dual benefit of Global Entry for international travel and TSA Pre✓™ for domestic travel. Global Entry charges $100, and membership is good for five years. The cost to join NEXUS is about half as much and also applies for five years.“I opted into TSA Pre✓™ but I rarely, if ever, get expedited screening.”.
