Glycolysis. 1  Glycolysis is the anaerobic catabolic reaction of glucose. 2  Glycolysis occurs in almost all cells. 3  This pathway takes place with or without the presence of oxygen. 4  Aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate as the end products of glycolysis. 5  In the eukaryotic cells, glycolysis occurs in the cytosol.
