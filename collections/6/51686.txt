Brockovich, who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life, said she is frightened of going to jail over the arrest and that her lawyer thinks she will just have to pay a fine. On the night of the incident, arresting officer Kasen Haslem reported that she appeared 'highly intoxicated' as she argued with her husband, Eric L. Ellis, aboard a boat docked at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor on Lake Mead.
