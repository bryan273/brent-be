Suddenly, a large blue and white bird screaming Jay! Jay! Jay! swoops to my feeder and chickadees, nuthatches, and assorted winter finches scatter in all directions. There's no doubt one of the local Blue Jays has just arrived to gobble down its share of sunflower seed and cracked corn.n winter, there are plenty of Blue Jays around the property--probably more than 100 visit at one time or another during any given day--and most fly just at treetop height. When they pass overhead as dark blue and white silhouettes against the sky, I can often see each is carrying something large in its mouth.
