Then drain off the water, add fresh cool water to cover by one inch and begin cooking. Cooked to perfection. Place the beans in a large, thick-bottomed pan and add enough cool water to cover them by an inch. Add any flavor enhancers (see below) if using, and bring to a boil. TIP: DO NOT salt the water, as this can cause the beans to toughen. Skim off any scum that comes to the surface, and lower the heat to a simmer.
