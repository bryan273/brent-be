Chiral Stereoisomers. The cis/trans or E / Z isomers formed by alkenes aren't the only example of stereoisomers. To understand the second example of stereoisomers, it might be useful to start by considering a pair of hands.For all practical purposes, they contain the same substituents four fingers and one thumb on each hand.ne enantiomer of these chiral compounds is dextrorotatory; the other is levorotatory. To decide whether a compound should be optically active, we look for evidence that the molecules are chiral. The instrument with which optically active compounds are studied is a polarimeter, shown in the figure below.
