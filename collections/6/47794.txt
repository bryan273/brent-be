The Patriots mix and match running backs each year so while they might add a back, but I doubt it will be an early priority. *Note: The Patriots were stripped of a first-round pick in the 2016 draft (plus a third-rounder in the 2017 draft) for the team's role in the deflated footballs scandal.Follow College Football 24/7 on Twitter @NFL_CFB.hile they seem to have the left side of the offensive line put together, the right side -- especially at guard -- needs to be addressed and quickly. The Colts simply aren't getting enough pass rush from the edge, and might have to make that a priority in the 2016 draft.
