How much are typical wedding invitation prices? The cheapest wedding invitations available are do-it-yourself kits. These can be found for $1-$2 per invitation through services such as WeddingBellInvitations.com. At an average of 100 invitations, this will cost between $100-$200. However, this will also take a lot of time – to those who believe that “time is money” – this may not be the best option. More complex and fancier do-it-yourself wedding invitations, which are also harder to make, will be between $3-$4 per invitation. This same price range applies to the cheaper end of the invitations you can order through a print shop or website such as WeddingPaperDivas.com.
