Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the primary source of energy expenditure in humans, and reductions in BMR can result in obesity and weight gain (201). TH is a key regulator of BMR, but the targets are not clearly established (137). BMR correlates with lean body mass (132) and thyroid hormone levels (52, 230).
