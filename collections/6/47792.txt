This is the first-round order for the 2016 NFL Draft, with the top positional needs for every team. The draft order is determined by record, using strength of schedule, and then conference and division records as tiebreakers (record and strength of schedule are official tiebreakers to determine draft order).hile they seem to have the left side of the offensive line put together, the right side -- especially at guard -- needs to be addressed and quickly. The Colts simply aren't getting enough pass rush from the edge, and might have to make that a priority in the 2016 draft.
