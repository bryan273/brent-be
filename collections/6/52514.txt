This is a particularly interesting area to study because we can observe two types of plate boundaries (divergent and convergent) and their processes in very close proximity. A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. Along these boundaries, lava spews from long fissures and geysers spurt superheated water. Frequent earthquakes strike along the rift. Beneath the rift, magma—molten rock—rises from the mantle.
