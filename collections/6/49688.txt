Adderall is a combination of two stimulant drugs, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Adderall XR is an extended-release form of the drug. Doctors also prescribe Adderall (but not Adderall XR) to treat narcolepsy. Adderall may help people with ADHD control their activities and increase their attention spans.
