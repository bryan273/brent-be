The pulmonary artery is the vessel transporting de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. A common misconception is that all arteries carry oxygen-rich blood. It is more appropriate to classify arteries as vessels carrying blood away from the heart.he blood leaving the left ventricle exits through the aorta, the bodyâ€™s main artery. Two coronary arteries, referred to as the left and right coronary arteries, emerge from the beginning of the aorta, near the top of the heart.
