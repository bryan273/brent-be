This is not the doctor's fault. It's a political problem. Doctors may vary in their interpretation of the rules, but generally that's a temporary thing and rules get clarified later, usually to be even stricter. And one more thing: Outside the US, adult ADD is not always a commonly accepted diagnosis. People who have actually studied it will tend to support stimulant treatment, but you may have to go out of your way to find somebody who specializes in it. Also, Adderall per se may not be available, though other stimulants usually are.
