Precipitation that does re-evaporate before reaching the ground is called virga, two examples of which are shown below: The more water vapor there is below the cloud, and the stronger the updrafts that cause this water vapor to condense into cloud water or ice particles, the more likely it is that precipitation will form within the cloud.
