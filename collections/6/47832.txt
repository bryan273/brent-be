Chapter 7 (Straight Bankruptcy) In a bankruptcy case under chapter 7, you file a petition asking the court to discharge your debts. The basic idea in a chapter 7 bankruptcy is to wipe out (discharge) your debts in exchange for your giving up property, except for exempt property which the law allows you to keep.
