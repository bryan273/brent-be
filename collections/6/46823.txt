How many calories are burnt in 6.6 miles in 1 hour? There are several components to calculate caloric burn for a 10 K run. Figure your weight, body mass (muscle vs fat), fitness level (aerobic capacity and training), your speeâ€¦d MPH, your age and gender. Plus you must figure running conditions such as terrain (sand, asphalt, uphill, downhill), weather (hot, cold, windy). As an average ballpark, a person may burn 600 to 1000 calories.
