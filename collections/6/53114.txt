Unlike the other SoundLink devices, the Wave SoundLink adaptor is not a standalone unit, but is a wireless Bluetooth receiver that connects via a cable to the Bose Wave integrated audio system, allowing music to be relayed to the system from a computer. It was introduced in 2009 at a US recommended price of $150.
