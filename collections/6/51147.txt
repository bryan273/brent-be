Midges fly in great swarms for the purpose of mating. After mating, the female Non-Biting Midges deposit their eggs over water, on plants in the water or in wet soil nearby. With the short lifespan of the midge, approximately one month in length, there may be as many as 5 generations produced over the summer.
