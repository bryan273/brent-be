Step-by-Step Tree Root Cutting Instructions. 1  Examine the root you want to cut. If possible, trace it back to the trunk of the tree from which it grows. 2  Figure out the right place to cut the root. You shouldn’t just cut the root at random. 3  After finding the right place to cut the root, mark it. Don’t just eyeball it. You don’t want to inadvertently cut it too closely to the tree. You can use spray paint or colored chalk to mark the root. Using a small spade, dig out the soil from around the root where you would like to cut it. You should also dig out some space below the root as well. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to pull the root free after you’ve cut it. For this step, you will need a root saw.
