You need to use filtered water. Always. I used regular water in mine for almost 6 months and then one day it stopped working. Fortunately, my husband takes things apart and fixes them for a living. The itty bitty water nozzle inside the mop was clogged. It was a quick fix, and after years of just using distilled water from the store, never a problem. I have not seen anyone in any review mention that they were using distilled water. This can very well be the issue. Also, keep your cup that you fill up your tank with clean. If you donâ€™t clean it right before you use it, you will have little bits of dust that accumulate in the water tank over time.
