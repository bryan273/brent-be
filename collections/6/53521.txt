When the heart is actively beating, “systole” occurs. That's when blood flows from the heart and into the arteries. When blood is being actively pushed into the arteries during systole, the pressure in the arteries increases. The peak blood pressure during cardiac contraction is called the systolic blood pressure. A condition called isolated systolic hypertension occurs when the systolic pressure rises to 140 mm Hg or above and the diastolic pressure remains below 90 mm Hg. Isolated systolic hypertension usually affects older people and is the result of a very clear and known disease process somewhere else in the body.
