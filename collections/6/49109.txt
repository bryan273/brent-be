Noel replied, None. Before 1997, I hadn't written a song without the aid of the old Colombian marching gear.. It was a strategy that seems to have worked. The title of the song, Wonderwall, was a subtle hat tip to Oasis' predecessors, the Beatles. In 1968, George Harrison released his first post-Beatles album, Wonderwall Music, which also happened to be the soundtrack to the film Wonderwall from that same year.
