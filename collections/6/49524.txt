IF thats the case then it has nothing to do with your internet as its already on your phone and installing. Now its all on your handset and maybe an issue there. This is your answer OP.'m assuming it's the download that is taking so long. I'm used to my Droid Razr Maxx HD and the status bar showed the app as downloading. The S6 just shows a green progressing line scrolling across the screen for the app. I believe the the word installing shows up when it is installing.
