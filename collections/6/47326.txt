There may have been other causes, especially since the average Rimadyl user tends to be an older dog. The most serious side effect seen is a rare liver reaction. Dogs that experience this reaction -- one out of every few thousand taking Rimadyl -- usually do so after they have been on the drug between two and six weeks. When a drug reaction is seen, it's because the drug is metabolized into something that is toxic to that individual's liver.
