These magma plumes rise to the surface and form chains of volcanoes. Composite volcano magma contains more silica, SiO 2, than that of a shield volcano and is therefore stickier (more viscous). This stickiness plugs up the volcano, causing pressure to build-up. The result is an explosive, dangerous eruption.
