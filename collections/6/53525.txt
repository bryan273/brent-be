DEAR READER: A blood pressure measurement includes two numbers: systolic pressure (the upper number) and diastolic pressure (the lower number). These numbers are measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. Your systolic pressure is high: 140 mmHg or over is high. And your lower number is normal: normal diastolic pressure is below 80 mmHg. When your systolic blood pressure is high and your diastolic blood pressure is low, itâ€™s called isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). People with ISH do benefit from treatment, as it lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.
