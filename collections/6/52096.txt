Lipase is an enzyme produced mainly by the pancreas (an organ located near the stomach) and secreted into the small intestine, where it helps breaks down fats (lipids) we eat into fatty acids and glycerol. A lipase test measures the amount of lipase in the blood. Small amounts of lipase are normally present in the blood. However, increased amounts may be released into the blood when the pancreas is injured or the pancreatic duct, the channel that carries enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine, is blocked.
