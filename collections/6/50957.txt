1. Draw and name all the stereoisomers that are possible for each of the following compounds. Identify the enantiomers and diastereomers. Answers : (a) There are two stereocenters in 5-bromo-3-ethyl-1-fluorohexane, and hence a maximum of four stereoisomers.The group priorities are: At C3.. Draw perspective formulas for all the stereoisomers of the following compound. Identify which ones are optically active and which are meso forms. For the optically active ones, identify enantiomers and diastereomers.
