An element's atomic number indicates the number of protons it has in the nucleus. In this case, since polonium's atomic number is 84, it has 84 protons. In a neutral atom, t â€¦ he number of protons is the same as electrons. This is because the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus must be balanced with by the negative charge of the electrons.
