If you're trying to figure out what time you'll arrive at the destination, you may want to see if there's a time difference between LHR and EWR. The calculation of flight time is based on the straight line flight distance from LHR to EWR (as the crow flies), which is about 3,466 miles or 5â€‰578 kilometers. Your trip begins at London Heathrow Airport in London, United Kingdom. It ends at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey. Your flight direction from LHR to EWR is West (-72 degrees from North). The flight time calculator measures the average flight duration between points. It uses the great circle formula to compute the travel mileage.
