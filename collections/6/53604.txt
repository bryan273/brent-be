Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper. Add the butter to the skillet. When the foaming subsides, raise the heat to high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the pan so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, for 1 minute.ightly coat the shrimp with the cornstarch. In a small bowl, mix the salt with the freshly ground pepper and set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons in a preheated wok on medium high to high heat. When the oil is hot, add the shrimp and stir-fry until they turn pink.
