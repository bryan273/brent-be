Livio's new book, The Equation that Couldn't Be Solved: How Mathematical Genius Discovered the Language of Symmetry continues in this niche, both in its format and in its unwieldy title. The book is perhaps best viewed as a series of disjoint chapters, all of which are related to the overall ideas of group theory, but presented without a coherent narrative.
