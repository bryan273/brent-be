Popcorn can be a very healthy snack but you need to pay attention to how it is cooked. Popcorn that is cooked in hydrogenated oils, drenched in butter or coconut oil, and over salted is not healthy. If you cook popcorn in canola or olive oil or air pop it, you will be eating a high fiber snack. Season popcorn with a drizzle of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder for a delicious healthy snack. Popcorn is a carbohydrate so limit the amount to a reasonable serving.
