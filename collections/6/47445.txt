Dentures are removable dental appliances that replace missing teeth. Unlike dental implants and dental bridges, which are more or less permanently affixed to the bone, dentures are prosthetic teeth attached to a supporting structure. Dentures can be removed at night, for cleaning, or whenever desired.
