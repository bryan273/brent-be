Kaur is a name used by Sikh women as either a middle or last name. The tenth guru of Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh introduced Kaur and Singh, when he administered Amrit (baptism) to both male and female Sikhs. All female Sikhs were asked to use the name Kaur after their forename and male Sikhs were to use the name Singh.
