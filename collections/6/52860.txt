AQUINO Italian, Spanish. From the name of an Italian town near Rome, the home town of the 13th-century saint Thomas Aquinas. In Italy it is derived directly from the town's name. As a Spanish-language surname, it was sometimes bestowed by missionaries in honour of the saint as they evangelized in Spanish colonies.
