This allows the intelligence of Windows to decide the correct software application to open your GDB file. In the case that your GDB file doesn't open, it is highly likely that you do not have the correct software application installed on your PC to view or edit GDB file extensions. If your PC opens the GDB file, but it's the wrong application, you'll need to change your Windows registry file association settings.
