Donnie Campbell and myself are going to try to run the 10 highest mountains in Scotland in a day. We are doing this because we had a free Saturday and fancied a challenge, but also to raise some money and awareness for SAMH (each penny makes a huge difference) and for the Fit in 14 campaign which is well worth supporting.
