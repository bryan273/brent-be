To get a better idea of which single coil pickups will suit your tastes best, you should definitely consider spending some time in this selection to look at each option more closely. With that in mind, you can easily imagine what the Fender Customer Shop '54 Strat Pickup Set Of 3 sounds like based on its title alone. Featuring staggered, hand-beveled Alnico 5 magnets and Forvar magnet wire wound to deliver clear harmonics and a classic tone, these pickups are unmistakably vintage in every way.
