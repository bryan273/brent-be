On the other hand, the judge may often consider aggravating factors and impose a harsher sentence than the minimum. The most common examples of mandatory minimum sentencing are the federal drug laws for possession of certain amounts of illegal drugs. For example, getting caught with one gram of LSD or 100 grams of heroin means you will spend at least five years in prison. Three-strikes laws are another form of mandatory minimum sentencing. Under these laws, you will face a specific minimum sentence if you are convicted of a third felony.
