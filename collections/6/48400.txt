The glomeruli of the kidneys contain a smooth muscle like cell called the mesangial cell. Smooth muscle is fundamentally different from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in terms of structure and function.unction of smooth muscles depends on the tissues where they are present.... In blood vessels, when the smooth muscles contract, they constrict the lumen of the blood vessels … (arteries) thus increasing the blood pressure, and when they relax, the lumen increases in diameter and thus brings down the blood pressure..
