Some feel that mutating a traditional name into a phonetic spelling is tantamount to “dumbing-down” the name, while others prefer the uniqueness they feel sets the name apart. In any case, Makayla is a relatively new spelling invention, first showing up on the U.S. popularity graphs in 1989. Clearly, parents found it an attractive alternative to Michaela because it rose pretty quickly to the top of the charts in 10 short years. Today, Makayla is a Top 50 choice for girls’ names. Another popular variation (Mikayla) popped up the same year and is the second most common spelling. The traditional spelling (Michaela) is in third place.
