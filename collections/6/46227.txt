Each follicle contains an immature egg (ovum) but only one follicle usually survives to maturity. It is supposed that ovulation pain is caused by the expanding follicle stretching the membrane of the ovary. Ruptured follicle - when the egg is mature, it bursts from the follicle. This may cause slight bleeding.
