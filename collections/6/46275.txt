The normal body temperatures for children are the same as an adult human and are considered to be between 36 to 36.8 degrees Celsius or 96.8 to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. In a child, any temperature that exceeds 36 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is considered to be high and is medically classed as a fever.
