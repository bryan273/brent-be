'Dancing With the Stars' 2015: Paula Deen Eliminated, But She's Excited to See Her Grandbabies. Grier, 15, was the latest competitor to leave the dance floor on the show's season 21. The Vine star hugged his pro partner, Emma Slater, when he learned he was going home. He, Alexa PenaVega, and Tamar Braxton had all been in jeopardy tonight. Elimination is based upon a combination of judges' scores and viewer votes, and the competitor with the lowest combined score is voted off.
