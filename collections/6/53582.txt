Glucomannan comes from the konjac plant (Amorphophallus konjac), specifically the plantâ€™s root. The plant is native to warm, subtropical to tropical eastern Asia, from Japan and China south to Indonesia. The edible part of the konjac plant is the root or corm, from which glucomannan powder is derived.
