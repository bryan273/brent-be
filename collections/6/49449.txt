UGMA / UTMA accounts are generally set up at a bank or brokerage firm. The custodian of an UGMA / UTMA account controls and manages the assets for a minor (the beneficiary of the account). A parent does not have to be the custodian of the account, and you can choose someone else to manage an UGMA / UTMA on your childâ€™s behalf.
