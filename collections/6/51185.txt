If you're one to poop and scoot quickly out of the bathroom without looking in the toilet, then you might want to slow down and look down. The Bristol Stool Chart is a handy tool that may help you learn what you're going for. Ideally, your stool should approximate Types 3, 4 and 5, like a sausage or a snake, smooth and soft to soft blobs that pass easily.. Type 4 is the Holy Grail.
