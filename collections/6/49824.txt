Someone is ready for his six seconds of fame. Hayes Grier, who is apparently a Vine star, has been revealed as the latest contestant who will compete on Dancing with the Stars season 21. Grier is just 15-years-old, making him the second-youngest contestant ever (Willow Shields from last season was the youngest at 14). He is the younger brother of Nash Grier, another, more popular Vine star. Hayes got his start appearing in his brother's Vines and then joined the family business himself. This latest bit of casting follows the recent trend of reality shows trying to capitalize on social media phenomena. One year ago DWTS cast YouTube personality Bethany Mota.
