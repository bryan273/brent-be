Categorical variables are also known as qualitative (or discrete) variables. These categorical variables can be further classified as being nominal, dichotomous or ordinal variables. Each of these types of categorical variable (i.e., nominal, dichotomous and ordinal) has what are known as categories or levels. These categories or levels are the descriptions that you give a variable that help to explain how variables should be measured, manipulated and/or controlled.
