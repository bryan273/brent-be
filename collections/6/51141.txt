Midges have a very interesting Life Cycle. Like butterflies and moths they have three very. different forms after they hatch. Firstly the larvae. (a wiggly worm-like creature with a big head), then the pupa where the larvaeâ€™s body parts. turn to mush and reorganise in a completely. different pattern, then finally the adult midge.
