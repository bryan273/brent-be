One reason for the surge in Adderall prescriptions is that increasing numbers of children and teenagers are getting an ADHD diagnosis. However, doctors also prescribe the drug to children and adults who do not have ADHD. This increased availability of Adderall has led to widespread abuse of the medication. Because Adderall increases dopamine levels, it can trigger a feeling of euphoria among people who don't have a medical reason to take it.
