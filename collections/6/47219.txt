A: There is no limit to the number of times that you may serve in a lifetime; however, you are only obligated to serve jury duty once every 12 months. After serving you are excused for one year, at the end of the year your name will go back into the pool for the possibility of again being summoned at random.: You can submit your change of address when you report for jury duty or call the office at (559) 457-1600 during normal business hours. We receive our juror information twice yearly from the Department of Motor Vehicles and Voters Registration.
