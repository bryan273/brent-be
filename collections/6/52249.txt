(See: wikipedia chip) Note that silicon (chips, solar panels) and silicone (soft rubbery material) are different! The most common electronic component is the transistor which works as a sort of amplifying valve for a flow of electrons. The transistor is a solid state device, meaning it has no moving parts.
