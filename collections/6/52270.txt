A disabled placard or residential parking permit does not provide an exemption from this restriction. To avoid a citation for violating the 72 hour maximum, you must move your car to another parking spot. The program's intent is to eliminate cars that are being stored or abandoned on a public street. We request that you wait 72 hours (3 days) for the car to be parked at the same location, before requesting a service call. This ensures the prevention of harassment or abuses of the program.
