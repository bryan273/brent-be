The tongue is a mobile group of muscles that is attached to the floor of the mouth. The top of the tongue is covered with small bumps called papillae. The majority of our taste buds sit on these papillae. The tongue is used for tasting, swallowing, and chewing food. The tongue is also used to form words for speaking.
