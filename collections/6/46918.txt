Here are just a few of the terms you're likely to hear from your child's ABA therapist: 1  The treat or reward offered for a job well done is called a reinforcer. 2  The request for a desired behavior is called a mand. 3  An imitated sound or word (the therapist says say spoon and the child says spoon) is called an echo.
