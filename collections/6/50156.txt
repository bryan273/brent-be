Its much easier to blow speakers with a 500 watt continous rating with a 50 watt power amp than a 700 watt power amp. Heres why....if you crank up the 50 watt amp, at a certain point distortion starts. Add a mixer where the faders are being pushed up pretty high to get more signal to go to the amp..
