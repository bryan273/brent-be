The measurements of tabloid size printer paper are 11 x 17, and it is often used to print newspaper pages, which are usually long and rather thin, or posters. Tabloid size printer paper will probably not fit into a standard desktop printer tray. It might fit in an adjusted office copier and printer tray, but if it is not commonly used then the bypass tray is probably the best place to use tabloid size printer paper.
