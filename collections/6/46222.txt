Here, we give only a brief summary of his quadrilateral systems. Within the quadrilateral systems, Escher's categorization has two factors: the type of polygon and the symmetries present in the tessellation. Specifically, he assigns a capital letter to each type of polygon and a Roman numeral to each type of symmetry. The polygons are: A - Parallelogram B - Rhombus C - Rectangle D - Square E - Isoceles Right Triangle Note that each is a special type of quadrilateral except for E, the isoceles right triangle. These 45°-45°-90° triangles fit together to form a square grid with order 4 rotation symmetry. Escher's ten different systems of symmetry do not correspond exactly to the wallpaper groups.
