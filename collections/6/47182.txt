The next most common stamp used is... 68 cent stamp, for those letters that are over an ounce in weight, but under two ounces. Many simple wedding invitation sets will be under an ounce (simple, as in, a flat 5x7 inch invitation + a flat 5x3.5 inch response card) and will only need that first class stamp. On the other hand, many invitations are just over an ounce.
