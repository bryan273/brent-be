Age Limitations. Claiming your 19-year-old as a dependent depends on when he turned 19. If he turned 19 on or before Dec. 31 of the tax year, you can't claim him unless he's a student. However, if you're preparing your taxes in April for the previous year, and if he turned 19 in January, he qualifies as your dependent.The guiding rule is how old he was on the last day of the year.f your child is married, this doesn't prevent you from taking a dependent deduction for him, provided neither he nor his spouse had any tax liability in the year during which you want to claim him. However, your child can't claim a standard deduction on his own tax return if he qualifies as your dependent.
