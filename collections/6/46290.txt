Replacement tails grow back in as little as three months or as long as two years. In other lizards, especially big ones like iguanas and Komodo Dragons, the tail bones are not designed to break and the tail muscles are not designed to pull apart.These lizards can lose their tails, but it takes a much stronger pull to make this happen. The wound will heal, but the tail does not grow back. got a pet lepord gecko and she got stuck in a hole. My dad was pulling her out by the tail and she dropped her tail. I know that lizards can drop their tails and regrow them, but how long will it take for her to regrow her tail. By the way we did get her out and that hole is not their anymore.
