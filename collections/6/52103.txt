A lipase test measures the level of a protein called lipase in your blood. Lipase helps your body absorb fats. Itâ€™s released by the pancreas, a long, flat gland between your stomach and spine. When your pancreas is inflamed or injured, it releases more lipase than usual. Your doctor may want to find out the level of this protein in your blood to find how your pancreas is doing.
