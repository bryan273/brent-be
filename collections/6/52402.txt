SID, also s.i.d., is a veterinary abbreviation meaning to give medication once a day. Medical professionals for humans instead use the term qd (an abbreviation for quaque die). However, that term can be easily mistaken with the term qid (an abbreviation for quarter in die), which means four times a day.
