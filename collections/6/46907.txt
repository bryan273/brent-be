A small, slender, sometimes shrubby tree, often with multiple thin trunks, this is another southern favorite, with pretty bark and masses of beautiful flowers in summer. A fourth commonly-planted street tree in Savannah is the palmetto, the majority of the large palm trees in the city being of this type. Other notable tree species you can see in Savannah’s parks and streets include the dogwood tree, marked by its profusion of four-petaled, white or pink springtime flowers, and the tulip tree, whose leaves look like a sycamore leaf with the top cut off and whose flowers, from which the tree’s name derives, bear a close resemblance to tulips.
