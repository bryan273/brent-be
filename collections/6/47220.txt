If not required to report, jury service is completed. If asked to report and not assigned to a courtroom on that day, the term of service will be completed. If selected on a case, jurors serve until released by the court. The average trial is 5 to 7 days.: You can submit your change of address when you report for jury duty or call the office at (559) 457-1600 during normal business hours. We receive our juror information twice yearly from the Department of Motor Vehicles and Voters Registration.
