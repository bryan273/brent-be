Views from the tallest bluff on the Mississippi River help make Pikes Peak State Park one of Iowaâ€™s favorite scenic attractions. The park is named after Lieutenant Zebulon Pike who recommended the site as a strategic location for a fort. Pikes Peak in Colorado was also named after Lieutenant Pike.
