Summary: 1.Binary fission occurs among prokaryotes (cells that do not contain a nucleus). 2.Mitosis occurs among eukaryotes (cells that have a nucleus). 3.Binary fission does not include spindle formation (mitotic apparatus) and sister chromatids in its process making it a faster means of cellular division than mitosis. 4.Binary fission does not have the four distinct cellular phases (from G1 down to the final mitotic phase) that are seen in mitosis.
