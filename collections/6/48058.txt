Phospholipids with certain head groups can alter the surface chemistry of a bilayer and can, for example, serve as signals as well as anchors for other molecules in the membranes of cells.ome molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical.
