In this lab, we will investigate how to measure the physical properties of organic compounds. The properties that we will be concerned with are: • water solubility of organic solvents. • density of organic solvents. • boiling points of organic solvents. • melting points of organic solids. • solubility of organic compounds in organic solvents and water. In general chemistry, the most common solvent is water.
