A quadroon is one-fourth African black and thus easily classed as black in the United States, yet three of this person's four grandparents are white. An octoroon has seven white great-grandparents out of eight and usually looks white or almost so.oss of security within the minority community, and fear and distrust of the white world are also factors. It should now be apparent that the definition of a black person as one with any trace at all of black African ancestry is inextricably woven into the history of the United States.
