The Detroit police force was overwhelmed. Officers made so many arrests that they had to hold detainees in makeshift jails. Many of those arrested were among the estimated 100,000 spectators watching the 10,000 rioters. On Monday, July 24, at the height of the riot, 231 incidents were reported every hour.
