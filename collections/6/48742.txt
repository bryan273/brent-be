Yet in a residential location, you might be pleased to know that a fake wall can actually appear to be a real wall. Fake walls can be just as stable as a real wallâ€¦ with the only real difference being that fake walls can be installed (and un-installed) much easier and affordably than a real wall.he most obvious reason for a fake wall is to divide a single room into two smaller rooms, without the cost and permanence of installing a new wall. This use is most common for those living in an apartment or renting a home.
