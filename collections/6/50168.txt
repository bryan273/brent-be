Dance Styles. I'm not a particularly good dancer, being part of that generation for which dancing involves shuffling one's feet about randomly while gyrating in provocative ways.I do manage to keep my feet off my wife's, though (well, most of the time).ance styles vary immensely both by time period and by region, so please let me know if you know of other styles that I haven't listed. Please note that it's rather difficult to define a complex dance in one line, and so I've avoided a lot of detail about specific steps, etc.
