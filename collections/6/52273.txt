Think about where your sign will be posted. If you're on a residential street, an 18x24 Coroplast yard sign should be perfect. Most traffic will be moving slow enough to see your message. If you are on a busier street, you may want to look at our larger Coroplast signs and larger yard signs to ensure the visibility of your message for the heavier traffic.
