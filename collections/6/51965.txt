About this Commercial. A biker gang speaks to an unseen person about an enemy that caused an all-out war. I want them dead, says the gang's leader. The person listening is revealed to be a veterinarian, and the leader is holding his little dog beset by fleas and ticks. In order to kill the pests, the doctor prescribes Bravecto. The leader feeds his dog a chew and dotingly assures her that they'll settle the score.
