Sea Otters give birth to their pup in the water and very rarely ever give birth on land. After birth the female watches her cub and grooms the pupâ€™s hair on her chest for the first few hours. New born otters are extremely helpless because they are blind and not very mobile. The growth rate of the otter is very slow.
