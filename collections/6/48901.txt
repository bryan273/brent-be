Latin itself today isn't usually used for speaking, but it is rather used in order to study language patterns and culture during times such as the Roman Empire when Latin would have been widespread. Many languages have words that derive from Latin. English especially has many words with Latin roots which usually helps relate to the meaning of the word. For example, the English word canine usually refers to animals such as dogs. The Latin word, canis, means dog.
