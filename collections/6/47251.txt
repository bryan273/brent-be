You don't have to say a lot. they know they are going to die but nobody can say when it will happen exactly. So before you go. just sit for 5 minutes and see if this person wants to talk and if that is so.. just hold his or her and listen...that will make them feel you have compassion... and just treat them as usual..f they have, then simply saying so long, or goodbye would be appropriate. It is a hard thing to go and say goodbye to someone...especially someone you care about.
