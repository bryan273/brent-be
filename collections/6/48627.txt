There are several types of Hummingbird Moths, including the Snowberry Clearwing Hummingbird Moth, the Tersa Sphinx Hummingbird Moth, and the White-lined Sphinx Hummingbird Moth, and perhaps over 100 more. It feeds through a proboscis, a long, straw-like tube kept curled under the head when not in use.
