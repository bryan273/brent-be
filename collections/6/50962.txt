Cost of metal roofing. There are several obvious benefits to metal. First is durability; water won't damage metal in the same way it does asphalt, meaning you'll have less repair and replacement work. Installing a metal roof is also much easier than laying down asphalt shingles, and replacing panels is quick and simple.
