Duran Duran was founded in 1978 by Nick Rhodes and John Taylor. After several line-ups and two demos, which they recorded in Bob Lamb's home studio, the classic line-up stood in May of 1980. On July 29th, they entered AIR studios in London and recorded early versions of 'Girls On Film' and 'Tel Aviv'.
