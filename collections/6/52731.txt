Martin Luther King: the story behind his 'I have a dream' speech. It's 50 years since King gave that speech. Washington DC, 1963, Martin Luther King reaches the climax of his speech. The night before the March on Washington, on 28 August 1963, Martin Luther King asked his aides for advice about the next day's speech. Don't use the lines about 'I have a dream', his adviser Wyatt Walker told him. It's trite, it's cliche.
