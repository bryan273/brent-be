Cardiac tamponade is the pathologic compression of the heart by fluid accumulating in the pericardial sac. It's life threatening and always fatal if undetected. Once cardiac tamponade is diagnosed, however, it can be successfully treated with minimal risk. The treatment of choice is pericardiocentesis, that is, needle aspiration of blood or other fluid from the pericardial sac.
