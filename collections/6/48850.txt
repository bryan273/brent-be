Flora and fauna [edit]. Coral reefs and tropical fish are abundant in the waters around the cayos. Dolphins, marine turtles and even some coastal caimans live in the remoter mangroves. Birds include pelicans, flamingoes, egrets and the odd scarlet ibis. On the islands, vegetation is sparse and generally adapted to the dry, salty environment.
