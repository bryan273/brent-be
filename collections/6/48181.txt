One glucose molecule yields two molecules of pyruvate. TCA cycle - It is also known as Kreb's cycle or Citric acid cycle. This cycle begins after the pyruvate molecules from glycolysis are converted to acetyl CoA. Through a series of steps high energy electrons are produced along with two ATP molecules in this cycle. This cycle occurs only in the presence of oxygen.
