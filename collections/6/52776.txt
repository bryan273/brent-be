In reply to michael, port st lucie. Thanks for writing in us on TD Helps, Michael. TD Bank routing numbers are based upon the TD location where you originally opened your account. If your account was opened in Florida, your routing number should be: 067014822. For a list of our current routing numbers please check out: http://bit.ly/1cmRPoF. If you are not certain which TD location you opened your account at, we invite to give us a call 24/7 at 888-751-9000 for your routing number or feel free to visit us during lobby hours for assistance.
