Individual suffering from increased levels of SGPT due to some liver or heart disease must also be on strict diet restrictions and proper rest. Initially the damage in the liver can be detected by simple blood test. It determines the presence of ALT which is related with SGPT in the blood. Usually under the normal circumstances this enzyme is concentrated within the cells of the liver. But when liver suffers from some injury this enzyme is spilled into the blood stream. The increase in the levels of SGPT in the blood indicates the disease related to liver. Normally ALT (SGPT) is found in the liver in large quantity. We can't say that this enzyme is located exclusively in the liver but it is concentrated in large quantity there.
