The music is based on Wonderwall Music, an instrumental album George Harrison wrote for the movie Wonderwall in 1968. This was the first solo album released by any of The Beatles. The concept of the Wonderwall is based on a '60s film called Wonderwall - from Psychedelia to Surrealism, starring Jane Birkin.
