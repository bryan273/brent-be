Also, we have the pleasure of viewing these moths, a creature that resembles a hummingbird in many ways. The Clearwing moth is a beautiful insect. The wings are solid red or brownish with reddish veins. To add to its lovely appearance, the inner portion of its wings lack scales and are clear giving the moth its name.
