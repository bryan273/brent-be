Best Answer: He will stay in jail until he is either Bailed out, goes to trial or pleads. If he gets prison, he will be sent as soon as his paperwork is completed and he can get transported. You don't serve part of the time in county jail and part in prison. He will get Credit for Time Served plus time for good behavior. I don't know how much time he would get it depends on if this is his first offense.
