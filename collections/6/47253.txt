When you get ill and are told you are going to die soon, needs come crowding in on you, jostling for scarce time and (often) scarce energies. So they in turn create their own need, a need for people and places to help you answer your needs. The need for places and organizations that I could turn to for practical information. 2  The need for someone to guide me, or go with me, round this new and unfamiliar domain of the terminal state-not necessarily the same someone for every sector of it.
