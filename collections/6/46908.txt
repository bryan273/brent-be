Identifying Common Savannah Street & Park Trees. The predominant street tree in Savannah is the southern live oak, distinguished by its size and majesty and by the huge drapes of moss that usually hang from its branches. Most of the shade trees in the city’s squares, in Forsyth Park, in Bonaventure and Laurel Grove cemeteries, and its streets (Jones Street is one of the best examples) are of this type. Another quintessential southern tree, far less common than the live oak but still with numerous specimens in Savannah’s squares and streets, is the magnolia.
