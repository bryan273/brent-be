Virginians know that Captain John Smith was vital to the survival of Jamestown in its early years. They can quote his order: “ He that will not work shall not eat .” But few know that Smith’s adventures started years before Jamestown. Born in 1580 in Willoughby, England, Smith left home at age 16 after his father died. He joined volunteers in France who were fighting for Dutch independence from Spain.
