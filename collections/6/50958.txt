2. Draw perspective formulas for all the stereoisomers of the following compound. Identify which ones are optically active and which are meso forms. For the optically active ones, identify enantiomers and diastereomers.Answer: There are two stereocenters; the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2 2. Both bear identical substituents, however, so there will be one pair of enantiomers ((3 R ,4 R)- and (3 S ,4 S)-3,4-dibromohexane) and one meso form: 3.. Draw perspective formulas for all the stereoisomers of the following compound. Identify which ones are optically active and which are meso forms. For the optically active ones, identify enantiomers and diastereomers.
