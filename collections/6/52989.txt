Many of us wonder: when do puppies stop growing? Truth be told, the answer varies by the size of the dog. Generally, smaller dogs will reach their full-grown size at a younger age than larger dogs. Itâ€™s safe to say that small dog breeds (Chihuahuas) have reached their full size by 10 months to 1 year of age. Small-medium dog breeds (Toy Poodles, Beagles, Miniature Schnauzers) will be finished growing by about 12-15 months and will have reached their full weight by about 18 months.
