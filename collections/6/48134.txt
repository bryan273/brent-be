OF MOTOR NOISES Electric motors are constructed of fairly rug- ged materials, such as iron, steel, aluminum, cop- per and in some cases permanent magnets. The purpose of the electric motor is to convert electric energy into mechanical work, either rotating or linear. This energy conversion process is achieved by a phenomenon or relationship be-
