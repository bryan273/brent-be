Winter container plants form new flowers and cold-hardy greens produce new leaves, but the growth won’t be as intense or fast as in spring, when days are longer, the sun is warmer, and days shake off winter’s chill. For this reason, it’s important to use a quality soilless mix in your winter container gardens.
