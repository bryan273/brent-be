Comments about Rogue VB100 Violin Bass Guitar: The Rogue VB-100 is an affordable and fun to play version of the famous Beatle Bass. The folks at Rogue got it right with the proper scale length, light weight body and powerful pickups. If you compare the VB-100 to a Hofner Icon Bass, you'll see they're very similar. The differences are very subtle: the Rogue has a fancy bridge unlike the straight bridge of the Icon.
