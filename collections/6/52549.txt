Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). If you get cold sores, you’re not alone. More than half of Americans ages 14 to 49 carry the virus that causes cold sores. The virus stays in the body after the cold sores clear. If the virus reactivates, or wakes up, you may get cold sores again. Cold sores are generally not serious. In healthy people, cold sores tend to clear within 2 weeks. If you have a cold sore, however, you can spread the virus to others who don’t have the virus.
