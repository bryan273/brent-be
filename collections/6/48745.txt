Step 6: Wall, meet wall. Find a stud on your actual wall. Using 4-inch drywall screws, attach the fake wall to the real one. Cover the screw holes with spackle and paint. Step 7: Hook it up. Now mount the TV and connect everything. Step 8: Kick back. You deserve it.ipe the whole wall with a damp paper towel, then paint it the color of the living room walls (or something awesomer). Step 4: Mount. Attach your TV mount like you own the joint: into the studs of your fake wall, where the support is greatest. Donâ€™t attach the TV yet.
