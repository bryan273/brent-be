Alabama registers vehicles under a staggered registration system, January through November, based on the first letter of the ownerâ€™s last name. Motor vehicle registrations expire on the last day of the designated renewal month. For example: someone whose last name begins with the letter J, K, or R is required to renew his/her vehicle registration in the month of August, and the previous registration expires on August 31.
