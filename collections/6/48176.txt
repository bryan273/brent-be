Over the recent years, scientists have discovered some of the advanced hunting techniques employed by dolphins. These animals are akin to hunt at coastal waters and they use echolocation to identify their prey. By emitting a sonic pulse, which is reflected by the nearby fish or other prey, dolphins actually locate where the victims are.
