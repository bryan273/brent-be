#5. Rio de Janeiro recently suffered a brutal rain and lightning storm that knocked out their electricity and flooded the streets. Things took a more interesting turn, however, when the 125-foot-tall statue of Jesus that overlooks the town was struck by an enormous bolt of lightning. Luckily, a photographer happened to catch the exact moment the statue was struck with a fuckload of gigawatts.
