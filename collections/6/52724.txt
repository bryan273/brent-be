Electrical alternans is another sign of advanced cardiac tamponade. On the cardiac monitor, it will appear as alternating levels of voltage in the P waves and QRS complexes in all leads, and may occur in the T waves, as well. Electrical alternans results from the heart swinging in the over-filled pericardial sac.
