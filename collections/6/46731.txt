The town of Blanchard, located on Idaho State Highway 41 6.5 miles (10.5 km) northwest of Spirit Lake was named for Joe Blanchard, an early settler who moved away to Kootenai Lake in Canada. Blanchard is 35 miles north of Coeur d'Alene and 40 miles south of Sandpoint, in North Idaho and has a post office with ZIP code 83804. R. C. Blackwell of the Panhandle Lumber Company, which operated sawmills at Spirit Lake, Idaho and at Ione, Washington, promoted the railroad, which came through Blanchard in 1908.
