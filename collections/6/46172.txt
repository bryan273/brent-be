Went to County with a few friends - sat in bar area, which was loud and energetic. The complementary hush puppies were amazing - we had the tuna crudo (YUM!) and the salmon tartare - which was out of this world! My friends had the halibut - which was beautifully presented - of which they both cleaned their plates.
