No matter what I do I haven't been able to get paint to stick and within a year of a repaint it bubbles and cracks. So, my thought is to use the 5 1/4 fiber cement boards with a 4 reveal for closest match to sides and back of house which will be the old cedar lap siding that is still in good shape. Cedar is nearly 3 times as much money! Also, other siding ideas are welcome.
