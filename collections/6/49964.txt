It is often said that the term cult and the occult are two sides of the same coin. It is true that there are common aspects of both terms and often some blurring occurs; cults frequently practice aspects of the occult and occult groups are (in a larger aspect of the word) themselves cults.Watchman Fellowship, however, usually makes a distinction between the term cult and occult. biblical warning concerning the occult is also provided that can be used as an outline for a Bible study on the subject or as a helpful tool in witnessing to someone involved in aspects of the occult.
