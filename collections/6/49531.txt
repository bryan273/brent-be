I have noticed that sometimes an app takes a long time to install, and sometimes it is very fast-even installing the same app on one phone, and multiple phones. I've noticed sometimes that it claims that it cannot be installed OTA, but has to be connected to itunes, but if I force it to install again, it's ok.ry it on wifi, 3G, different places... Well I've noticed that even since day one that it takes at least a minute to install any apps, and larger apps take even longer. It's never been faster than a minute for me. For this guy, he's installed 5 other apps so far, and none taking longer than 20 seconds.
