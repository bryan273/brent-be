When we say goodbye to someone I always feel the need to say make it last, this is the last goodbye you ll give but I feel like people would think that I would kill them or just think I m going insane.k here's the deal, 2 days before someone dies, (I know them personally or I know a close family member.) I get this really weird feeling, sounds around me are amplified and I feel like I'm getting dizzy. The only problem is I don't know who is going to die. Anybody else out there ever feel this way.
