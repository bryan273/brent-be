American toads have 1-2 large warts in each of the largest dark spots on their back. Photo by Mike Marchand. American toads can vary in appearance and may hybridize with Fowlerâ€™s toads where their ranges overlap, making identification difficult on occasion. A combination of features should be examined before making a conclusion regarding the identity of a toad.
