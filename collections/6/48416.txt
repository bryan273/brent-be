Suction & steam power. Bissell Symphony is a cyclonic vacuum, with a good suction power. However, I must warn you, this vacuum cleaner is not meant to be used on carpets and rugs, and it is especially designed for tile and laminate floors. Anyway, you can use its airflow to gather most of the bigger debris around the house.
