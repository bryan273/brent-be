It isn't necessary that all atoms tend to a diatomic state. The reason why any atom binds with other atoms is to tend to a stabler state. Gold exists in the free state because it is highly stable, and gold atoms do not find a state of lower energy very often, although there are certain gold compounds too. The short answer: Atoms bind to other atoms to form molecules to achieve a state of lower energy.
