Strengthen your quads!. Quads, of course, stands for the quadriceps. These four large muscles in the thigh control leg extensions at the knee. The poor knee joint absorbs a lot of force during ordinary daily activities (walking, squatting, climbing stairs) and not-so-ordinary activities (running, playing tennis).ooking back, I realize that strengthen your quads was the most dangerous advice I ever got. Strengthen your quads makes abundant sense when you want to protect healthy knees against future pain. Strengthen your quads may make sense if your knees hurt, but not too badly, and they can tolerate the exercises.
