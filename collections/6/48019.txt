racor_2006. You should use a good potting soil that drains well. Do not use Cactus mix as it does not have enough nutrients. I use kelloggs Patio Plus and have used other organic potting soils. They do great in pots. I have them in 15gal pots with a pole as a trellis which it will need for support. Good luck.
