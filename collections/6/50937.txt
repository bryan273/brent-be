It’s rather bland, so I’m glad that Auburn was able to create a more exciting and distinct logo. 1971-1981: The Aubie head logo became an alternate logo in 1971. Auburn made the logo above to be another alternate logo at the same time. It uses a block “A” with the Aubie head logo in the center of it. It also features an “AUBURN” wordmark at the bottom.
