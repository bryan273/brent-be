Anaerobic Respiration The first step in cellular respiration in all living cells is glycolysis, which can take place without the presence of molecular oxygen. If oxygen is present in the cell, then the cell can subsequently take advantage of aerobic respiration via the TCA cycle to produce much more usable energy in the form of ATP than any anaerobic pathway.
