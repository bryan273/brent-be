Since 2010, it can also be found on the remastered Special Edition of 'DURAN DURAN'. Also on the 'STRANGE BEHAVIOUR' CD is an otherwise unreleased remix of 'Hold Back The Rain'. It is suspected that both 'Hold Back The Rain' and 'Planet Earth' were remixed specifically for the 'CARNIVAL' EPs, but never used.
