The heart is a pump that constantly supplies the body with oxygen and nutrients via the blood supply. There are four chambers of the heart: a right atrium, a right ventricle, a left atrium and a left ventricle.ith this defect, the blood is trapped on either side of the heart; the blood on the right side mostly stays on the right side, cycling through the lungs and back to the right side, and the blood on the left side mostly stays on the left, cycling through the body and back to the left side.
