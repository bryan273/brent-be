This will get rid of the most brittle, dry hair. You may even like to get the ends trimmed once a month or every other month until your hair returns to its normal texture. In 6 to 12 months most of your chemo curls will be gone and you'll be free to try new styles with your short hair. Enjoy your new hair.
