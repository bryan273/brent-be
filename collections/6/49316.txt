For example, water is composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom: the chemical formula is H2O. A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a chemical reaction. In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and then bonds are reformed so that new associations are made between atoms.
