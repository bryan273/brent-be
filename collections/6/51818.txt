Smuts, which belong to the Ustilaginales, produce intercalary teliospores, undergo sexual reproduction with the fusion of sexually compatible hyphae, have many clamp connections, require a single host, and only attack angiosperms. The main difference is that rusts require two hosts (usually), and smuts only require one.
