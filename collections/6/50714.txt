People are misunderstanding the question. Payton is obviously the best player in the group, in terms of career, but the question is who was the best point guard in the Triangle under Phil, in terms of only that performance for Phil in the Tri? Payton is the worst. Harper was the best. Paxson, Armstrong, and Fisher were stalwarts.
