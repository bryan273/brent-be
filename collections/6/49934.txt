Any dog or cat can develop an ear hematoma. Because allergic skin disease is a common cause, any pet prone to skin allergies in more likely to develop an ear hematoma. The problem develops easier in dogs with more pendulous ears, because heavy ear flaps easily slap against the side of the head during head shaking.
