PreCheck gives you access to a special TSA security line in most US airports on flights operated by most US carriers. That line is generally faster, and you don’t have to remove your shoes or take anything out of your bag. It costs $85 for five years, slightly less than Global Entry but without the other benefits.lobal Entry: It’s the most expensive program, at $100 for five years, but comes with the best benefits: You can skip the lines at passport control and customs when entering the United States and also enjoy TSA PreCheck, Nexus, and Sentri (explained below).
