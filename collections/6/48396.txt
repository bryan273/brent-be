Example 1. Translation of axes. Here is the graph of the natural logarithm, y = ln x (Topic 20). And here is the graph of y = ln (x − 2) -- which is its translation 2 units to the right. The x-intercept has moved from 1 to 3.And the vertical asymptote has moved from 0 to 2.xample 1. Translation of axes. Here is the graph of the natural logarithm, y = ln x (Topic 20).
