Domestic - 90 minutes before your flight International - 120 minutes before your flight BUT..if you're traveling on a heavy day (ie Wed, Thrus night, Friday, Saturday) during high capacity times (mid-day thru early evening) then show up at leastr 120 min early for domestic, and 160 minutes for international flights.
