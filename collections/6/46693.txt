Put the canner on the stove on the largest burner. Put the rack (usually a metal plate with holes in) into the canner and 2 to 3 inches of hot water into the canner. Place the filled jars (with the lids and rings on) fitted with lids, on the jar rack in the canner. Put the canner lid and seal it down.
