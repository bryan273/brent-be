The Bissell Symphony Pet 1543 is the newest member of the Symphony family, which appeared on the market just a few days ago. Whatâ€™s changed from the original version? First, you can equip this unit with a new type of disposable mop pads produced by Swiffer in collaboration with Bissell, called SteamBoost mop pads (but you can use these with the original 1132).
