The Denali uses the same transmission as other Yukons but is geared for better acceleration. Passing up the options ladled on my test trucks will knock the prices down significantly. A base rear-drive Yukon SLE is $47,330, and the Yukon XL SLE starts at $50,030. But even the cheapest Yukon Denali is $63,675.
