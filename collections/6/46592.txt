Some introductions have been accidental, but most exotic plants have been introduced as garden plants, pasture grasses or other horticultural plants. Of the ten new weeds recorded in Australia each year, two thirds are escaped garden plants. These weeds come from plant species that are already in Australia. Sometimes plants that are now weeds have only become so years after they were first introduced. Sleeper weeds are plants from overseas that have established small populations but have not yet spread widely.
