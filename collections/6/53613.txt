On the other hand, for bringing a Stratocaster back to its roots with tone faithful to the original, there's the Fender Pure Vintage '59 Strat Pickup Set. Or for a more modern approach to the Strat with humbucker-like performance, try the Fender Super 55 Split Coil Stratocaster Pickup Set. Maybe you're a fan of the underdog models? In that case, check out the Fender Pure Vintage Jazzmaster Pickup Set or the Fender Pure Vintage Jaguar Pickup Set. With so many different Fender guitar pickups here to choose from, it's safe to say you can find a great set to deliver your ideal tone no matter what that ideal happens to be. That choice is up to you, since every guitarist has a different impression of what constitutes the best guitar tone possible.
