Since a 5 is a common divisor and is a multiple of every commondivisor, it is the gcd.36. (1; 2; 1). [10,6] First express the inequality as (x ¡ y 2) 2 + 34 (y ¡ 2) 2 + (z ¡ 1) 2 1.Since x, y, and z are integers, this implies z = 1 and y = 1, 2, or 3.If y = 1, weobtain x 2 0, which has no integer solutions.If y = 2, we obtain x 2 ¡ 2 0,whose only integer solution is x = 1.1; 2; 1).
