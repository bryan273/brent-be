1 In the citrus belt, trees can be planted at any time, however, spring is the best time for container grown plants. 2  Standard-size trees should be spaced 12 to 25 feet apart and dwarf trees should be set 6 to 10 feet apart. 3  The exact distance depends on the variety.4  The bigger the fruit, the farther the distance.ave an orange tree with two varieties of oranges. One edible with seeds and the other from the top, bitter. Also have a lemon tree with two varieties. One like a Meyer with thin skin but the other has a thick rind and is quite large (Both trees have thorns).
