BuckeyeShelby said, I completed chemo at the end of Jan 2013. I dumped the hats & scarves at the end of April 2013. First hair cut (basically to shape it as it started to grow) was in June 2013.. Phoenix76 said her hair started to regrow after about 2 weeks and problems. It has grown really slowly - it's now about 9 inches after two years. So, it was almost a year before I felt comfortable with it enough to go without my wig. I think it was about 3 inches or so.
