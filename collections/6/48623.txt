The smallest hummingbird species in the world is the Cuban Bee Hummingbird, Mellisuga helenae, and it measures 5-6 cm in length (2.0-2.4 inches) and weighs a mere 1.6-1.9 grams (roughly 1/14 of an ounce). Most species, however, are larger: in the U.S., most species are 3.0 - 3.5 inches in length. Hummingbird moths are considerably smaller than the smallest hummingbird. This recognition problem is perhaps the single most common query presented to the Hummingbird Society, often with a photo attached. Some are not convinced, despite the scientific evidence. When in doubt, one can always get closer and count the legs...it is a sure way to distinguish between an insect and a bird!
