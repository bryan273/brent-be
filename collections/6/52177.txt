Reproduction. The sole purpose of a flower is reproduction, and for that purpose, a flower comes armed for the job. Every part of a flower, including scent and beauty, furthers the plant's reproductive strategy. When it blooms, a flower reveals male and/or female parts. The male part is the stamen, which consists of a filament topped by an anther. The anther produces pollen, and within that pollen are sperm.
