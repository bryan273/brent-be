Proteins for use within the eukaryotic cell or intended for organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes are synthesized by mRNA molecules attached to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Electron micrograph of rough endoplasmic reticulum courtesy of Dennis Kunkel's Microscopy.) provide a surface area for protein and lipid synthesis; 2) form a pathway for transporting molecules within the cell; and 3) provide a storage area for molecules the cell has synthesized. 1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum ER with ribosomes attached is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 31, Fig.
