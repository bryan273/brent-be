5 c. vegetable oil. Make the dough: Combine water and yeast in a large bowl, stir until yeast dissolves, and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 1 cup flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until bubbly -- about 30 minutes. Lightly coat a large bowl with 1 teaspoon butter and set aside. Place remaining butter in a large bowl and beat in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or by hand with a wooden spoon until creamy -- about 1 minute.
