Re: If x, y, and z are three-digit positive integers and if x = [#permalink] Wed Dec 17, 2014 5:14 am. Expert's post. Your first example does NOT satisfy the first statement: the tens digit of x is equal to the sum of the tens digits of y and z. So, it'as not valid. Sorry, cannot explanation any better.47. 300. Here when we add the tens digits 5 and 4 and carry over 1 from the units place, we get 10, so we have carry over 1 from the tens place to the hundreds place, thus the hundreds digit of x (3) does NOT equal to the sum of the hundreds digits of y (1) and z (1).
