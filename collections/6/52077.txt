She symbolizes the American Dream. In The Great Gatsby the southern belle Daisy Fay, the first nice girl James Gatz had ever known, is the bright symbol of Gatsby's dreams. Beautiful and rich, she is the incarnation of all his elaborate fantasies, his vision of the American Dream. --Richard W. Lid, Ford Madox Ford: The Essence of His Art, 1964.
