Depending on the type of fabric, most professional upholstery cleaners will either steam-clean furniture upholstery or use a dry-cleaning solvent. The cost of cleaning depends on the size of the furniture, the kind of fabric and the condition of the furniture. Typically, the cost to clean an armchair or recliner ranges from $30 to $50, Clumpner says, while most customers will pay $50 to $60 for a love seat. The cost of having a couch cleaned can range from $70 to $80, and a larger sectional sofa can cost between $100 and $150, he adds. Cleaning oversized or overstuffed furniture can cost a bit extra, Clumpner says.
