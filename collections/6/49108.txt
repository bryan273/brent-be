Song Review by Chris True. Written by Noel Gallagher for his girlfriend (now ex-wife) Meg Matthews, Wonderwall did the one thing that British rock bands had been unable to do in years: break America. This simple love song rocketed Oasis to the levels of rock royalty, and Noel Gallagher earned worldwide respect for his writing ability.
