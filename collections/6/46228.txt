There are a few theories as to what causes this pain; 1  Irritation caused by blood and fluid when the egg is released. The blood and fluid can irritate tissues in the abdominal lining. 2  Bruising is caused during ovulation when the ovarian wall ruptures. 3  Fallopian tube muscle contractions cause discomfort.
