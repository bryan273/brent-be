An internist is a physician who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the adult populationâ€”both acute and chronic. These doctors are often who adults see as their primary physicians because they treat a broad range of illnesses that do not require surgical or specialist interventions. They also work to help a patient maintain optimal health in order to prevent the onset of disease.
