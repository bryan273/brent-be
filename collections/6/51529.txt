Science has been finding that menstrual blood is actually really healthy. There are some scientists who have been drinking it and they have reaped wonderful benefits. I recommend doing a little research on drinking menstrual blood. Drinking your own fresh morning urine might be healthy too. It can clear your skin like nothing else.
