1 Range: for x in the domain (- ∞ , -2) , the range of x - 4 is given by (0,+∞). 2  Since the range of the argument x - 4 of ln is given by (0, +∞), the range of ln(x - 4) is given by (-∞, +∞) which is also the range of the given function. 3  Find the inverse of f, write f as an equation and solve for x.ind the inverse, its domain and range, of the function given by. 1  Let us first find the domain and range of the given function. 2  Range of f: (-∞,+∞). 3  Write f as an equation, change from logarithmic to exponential form.
