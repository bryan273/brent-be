The expression is positive over the intervals: (-infinite, 1) U (2, +infinite). So, the logarithmic function exists for values of x that belong to the ranges (-infinite, 1) U (2, +infinite). The reunion of intervals represents the domain of definition of the given function f(x) = ln (x^2 - 3x + 2).o the domain of the function is all values of greater than 2 and less than 1. giorgiana1976 | College Teacher | (Level 3) Valedictorian.
