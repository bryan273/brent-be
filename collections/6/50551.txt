Debating on either James Hardie or Certainteed fiber cement board. Certainteed is about $1.25 cheaper a board and seems comparable in quality. Does anyone have experience with either for comparisons sake? I am trying my best to match 3.5 beveled cedar lap siding that is original from 1925. I am only residing the front of house where there is the most sun/rain.
