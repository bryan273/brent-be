1GL or first-generation language was (and still is) machine language or the level of instructions and data that the processor is actually given to work on (which in conventional computers is a string of 0s and 1s). 2GL or second-generation language is assembler (sometimes called assembly) language. An assembler converts the assembler language statements into machine language. 3GL or third-generation language is a high-level programming language, such as PL/I, C, or Java. A compiler converts the statements of a specific high-level programming language into machine language.
