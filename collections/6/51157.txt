A quick learner is a noun modified by a adjective - a fact overlooked by some here, except for Quora User and Say Keng Lee. So . . . for the adjective these are not synonyms, but they might fit depending on context: attentive/adept/studious/skilled/clever/astute/keen/avid/enthusiastic. for the noun there are synonyms: student/pupil/scholar/novice/beginner.
