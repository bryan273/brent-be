Since the early 19th century, Savannah planted out trees in its streets and squares to provide shade in the summer and beauty the year round, earning it the title of “The Forest City.” Today, its arching live oaks, swathed with picturesquely gothic drapes of Spanish moss, are one of the city’s most charming and typical sights.
