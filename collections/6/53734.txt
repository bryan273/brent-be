While twin XL is preferable (minimum length of 90), twin comforters and duvets (86 and up) can work on an 80 inch extra long twin mattress but they will be short. Please note that your mattress topper, fitted sheet, mattress pad, and bed skirt must be manufactured to properly fit a twin extra long mattress.
