Some of these internal membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum, have direct connections to one another. Other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex transport materials to other organelles in vesicles.A vesicle buds off of one organelle and transports materials when it fuses with another membrane. We will now look at the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells.) provide a surface area for protein and lipid synthesis; 2) form a pathway for transporting molecules within the cell; and 3) provide a storage area for molecules the cell has synthesized. 1. Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum ER with ribosomes attached is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 31, Fig.
