So, how long does the divorce process take – start to finish? On average I would say an uncontested divorce takes about 3 months and a contested divorce takes about 9 months to a year – in New York.Again, I said on average. The duration of different cases differ for different reasons.f you are in an international divorce situation, this could take longer than a divorce in your own country when both parties reside in the same place, for example. These days, for example, many people are going the mediation route. This tends to shorten the divorce time by months and even years.
