VIDEO OF WOODWORKERS AND ENGINEERS TRY SQUARES : The woodworkers try-square is composed of two main parts - the stock and the blade. The blade is made from hardened and tempered steel which makes is resistant to damage. The stock is usually made from rosewood although cheaper versions can be made from plastic or cheap woods. A brass face is added to the stock to ensure a straight edge. A typical use of a woodworkers try-square can be seen opposite. The try-square is pushed against the straight edge of a piece of wood and a marking knife is then used to mark a straight line across the material. The line is continued all the way round the wood (all four sides are marked).
