The start capacitor provides a quick shot of extra current to help get the motor moving, and (in some motors) tells the motor which direction to run. If the capacitor is defective, often the motor will just sit there and hum because it is trying to run in two directions at the same time. If you give the motor a little spin, it will take off and run in the direction you spin it. If your motor is 3 phase, there is often a small centrifugally-activated switch inside the motor that briefly routes current to the start windings. If this switch is bad, your motor will have a difficult time starting. This switch can be replaced fairly easily.
