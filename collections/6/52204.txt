Do It Daily. Try to walk briskly for at least half an hour every day, or for one hour four times a week. If you weigh 150 pounds, walking at 3.5 miles an hour on flat terrain burns about 300 calories per hour. So this schedule would burn about 1,100 calories a week. If you canâ€™t work that into your schedule, try more frequent, shorter walks.
