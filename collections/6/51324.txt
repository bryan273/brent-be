Root Nodules (Legume–Rhizobium Symbiosis) Abstract. Root nodule symbiosis enables nitrogen‐fixing bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that is directly available for plant growth. Biological nitrogen fixation provides a built‐in supply of nitrogen fertiliser for many legume crops such as peas, beans and clover.
