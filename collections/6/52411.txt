The United States currently spends more per person on health care than any other developed country. Health outcomes in the U.S., however, are among the worst. Despite weak health spending growth worldwide, a number of countries still had substantial health care budgets as of 2012. Based on data released by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the U.S. led the developed world in 2012, spending $8,745 per capita on health care.
