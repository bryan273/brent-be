Dens are often bank burrows vacated by other animals, but may also be located in log jams, natural cavities or thick vegetation. Otters do not settle into one den for an extended time unless they are raising young. These charming creatures usually mate for life. Breeding in the spring, females exhibit a period of delayed implantation that lasts from 290 to 380 days. Add an active pregnancy of 60 to 63 days, and otter pups may be born more than a year after the female has successfully bred.
