While your conundrum is very understandable, I’m here to set the record straight. These four programs have two very different intended uses: writing and coding. Wordpad and Microsoft Word are for writing, and Notepad and Notepad++ work better for coding. I’m not going to pitch a writing program against a coding application here. They’re on two entirely different spectrums, so I won’t waste anybody’s time trying to compare them.
