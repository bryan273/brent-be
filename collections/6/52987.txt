The Maltese matures at no more than 7 pounds, with most specimens weighing between 4 and 6 pounds. Maltese puppies stop growing about the age of 8 months. By the time your Maltese reaches her first birthday, she's reached her full size, but it's a safe bet she hasn't grown significantly in the previous four months.
