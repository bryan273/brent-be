Be aware, this is NOT for beer and wine making. I'm not sure what exactly I'll use it for now, but it could be fun to measure spirits from the store and see how they really measure up ... or cut store bought spirits to a different strength. It seems to be quality made, certainly as nice as my other beer and wine hydrometer that it was meant to be a backup for.
