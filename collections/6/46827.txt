Using their findings and doing some of my own calculations, I calculate that a 65kg person would burn an extra 48 calories (kcal) if coughing for one entire hour (which is less than a slice of bread). A ten minute bout of coughing would expend only 8 calories. In terms of giving your ‘abs’ a workout – coughing for long periods will put your muscles under quite a lot of strain. When coughing out, a selection of muscles are used as well as the ‘six pack’ (the rectus abdominis).
