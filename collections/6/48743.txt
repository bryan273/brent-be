One of the greatest money saving benefits of the installation of a fake wall-- and one that gives fake walls a leading advantage over installing a real wall-- is that you can find a fake wall that includes a door, and windows.he most obvious reason for a fake wall is to divide a single room into two smaller rooms, without the cost and permanence of installing a new wall. This use is most common for those living in an apartment or renting a home.
