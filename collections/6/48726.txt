Type = to signify that you are entering a numerical formula and not a text string. Enter the formula by referencing the cells that have the price and the sales tax respectively. The necessary formula is Cell with Price + (Cell with Price * Cell with Tax Rate Percentage). For example, if the price is in cell A3 and the tax rate is in cell B3, then the corresponding formula is +A3+(A3*B3).
