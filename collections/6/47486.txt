If you give money or property to your children and don’t get something of equal value in return, the IRS calls it a gift, whether you designate it as a gift or not. Each year you can give your adult children some money without filing a gift tax return or otherwise reporting the gift to the IRS. This is the annual exclusion. For example, the 2012 annual exclusion was $13,000. If you give a gift of a future interest, you can’t claim it in your annual exclusion.
