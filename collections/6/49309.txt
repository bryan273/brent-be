Ben Nevis is the highest peak in Scotland, located at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of Scotland, close to the town of Fort William. It's not just the highest peak in Scotland, it's also the highest peak in Britain and the highest peak in the U.K. Three in one! Its summit is at 1344 meters and you start the ascent at or very near sea level. It's a full day's trek to the summit and back, or at least it is for me.
