Gums recede for several different reasons. The primary cause of gum recession is due to gum disease. When bacteria invade the area around the tooth it causes the gums to detach and creep farther down the root. Other causes include the use of tobacco, abrasive toothbrushing techniques, tooth misalignment and grinding.
