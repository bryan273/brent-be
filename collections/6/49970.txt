With a 15 kilogram parcel, you're in luck. At this weight, you're still able to send massive packages via the full range of companies we offer. You can still choose a DX Secure next day parcel delivery service for only £7.79 + vat, or if you prefer Parcelforce 24 for £10.89+ vat.Only at around 25kg does it become more cost-effective to switch over to DX.hen you start to get to items weighing 15kg or so, then it becomes a hassle taking them to your usual supplier for parcel delivery, so it makes sense to use couriers that offer a collection service.
