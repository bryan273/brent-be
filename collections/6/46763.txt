There are some typical forms that happen a lot in music. The first is binary, which is a simple two part form. That is, there’s two over all section. The simplest way to illustrate this is with letters (“||: :||”=repeat signs): ||: A :||: B :||. Or in prose: something (A) that is repeated twice, then something different (B) that’s repeated.
