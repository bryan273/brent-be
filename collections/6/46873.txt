Most men find that one testicle is slightly bigger than the other or hangs lower than the other. Usually, it is the left testicle that hangs lower (though the right testicle may be larger), as a result of fetal development. In most cases, testicular size has nothing to do with a manâ€™s fertility or his sexual function, and slight differences in testicular size are not cause for concern.
