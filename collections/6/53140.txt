Plantar fasciitis is a condition in which the plantar fascia (the band of tissue that runs along the bottom of your foot from your heel to toes) becomes inflamed after excessive stretching or overuse. Heel pain is a common result of plantar fasciitis, as irritation turns into inflammation or swelling.
