Remembering the Miracle on the Hudson. Remembering the Miracle on the Hudson. It seems like yesterday when a U.S. Airways plane crashed into the Hudson River before our very eyes, but Jan. 15, 2017 marks the 8-year anniversary when Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger safely landed the passenger plane and saved the 155 people on board.
