Gas powered Weed Eater trimmers that produce a fuel smell but won't start, may have a flooded engine. Set the trimmer aside for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the fuel to vaporize, and then simultaneously squeeze the throttle trigger and pull the starter rope handle repeatedly until the engine starts and runs.
