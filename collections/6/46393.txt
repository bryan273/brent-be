As little as five years ago, language schools in France were taking on pretty much anyone to teach English, as long as they were a native speaker and spoke a bit of French. But thankfully, there are more and more TEFL (or TESOL in the USA) teachers out there, so language schools no longer need to take on non-qualified teachers.
