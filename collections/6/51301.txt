Diagnosis of Salmonella Infections. Children who have Salmonella symptoms and have been exposed to a source of Salmonella bacteria, either from contaminated food, pet turtles, and other reptiles, or farm animals should see their pediatrician. Testing will likely include a stool culture, in which the Salmonella bacteria may be found. Sources: CDC.
