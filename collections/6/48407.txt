Other structures in the body that contain smooth muscle include the myometrium-the muscular wall of the uterus-which is responsible for the rhythmic contractions of labour; the piloerector muscles, which cause skin hair to stand up; and the irises, which control the diameter of the pupils.unction of smooth muscles depends on the tissues where they are present.... In blood vessels, when the smooth muscles contract, they constrict the lumen of the blood vessels â€¦ (arteries) thus increasing the blood pressure, and when they relax, the lumen increases in diameter and thus brings down the blood pressure..
