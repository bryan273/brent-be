A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants. Some bumblebees native to North America are also vanishing, such as Bombus terricola, Bombus affinis, and Bombus occidentalis, and one, Bombus franklini, may be extinct.
