pH balance is a fundamental component of vaginal health. While the vagina's pH changes over the course of a woman's lifetime (see graph for more information), a healthy vagina generally tends towards a more acidic pH, ideally between 4.2 and 5. This results from the presence of lactobacillus, normally occurring bacteria that produce lactic acid.
