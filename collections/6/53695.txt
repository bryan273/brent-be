Re: John Deere Disk Plow (Pict's) in reply to Beatles65, 01-09-2011 17:37:39. I'll say one thing the photo of that one-way you posted shows it is indeed an oldie. Seems to be a terminology issue from location to location. On the great plains it would be a one-way.onsidering buying this old John Deere disk plow. Was told it would be used behind a John Deere D. The gentleman is asking $250 for it. About scrap price.
