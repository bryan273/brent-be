Basketball Court- Half Court. Hey everybody. Let's start off by saying that I'm planning on making a basketball court by the dimensions of 30x30 feet with a portable basketball hoop not in the ground(cheaper). I plan on digging 7in down throughout. I didn't really know what to lay for the foundation like gravel or what not.
