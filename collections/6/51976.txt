Edema is swelling caused by fluid retention-excess fluid is trapped in the body's tissues. In the UK/Ireland/Australasia and some other countries, the word is spelled oedema. Swelling caused by edema commonly occurs in the hands, arms, ankles, legs and feet. It is usually linked to the venous or lymphatic systems.
