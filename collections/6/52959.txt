Tie a 12-inch balloon on top of the 5-inch balloon cluster at the knots with curling ribbon. Blow up a #260 animal balloon with a balloon pump, leaving a little at the end unblown. Bend it into the shape of a circle and gently tie the loose ends of the balloon together to form the ring for the pacifier.
