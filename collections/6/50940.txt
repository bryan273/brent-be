Hi, Astrid, Here's my 2 cents on memory and CPTSD. Like you, I consistently have intermittent memory problems, both short and long term. But most of the questions I have about my memory loss involve not just past trauma, but head injuries I sustained during risky behaviors I engaged in throughout my 20's and earlier.
