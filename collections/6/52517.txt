According to plate tectonics, the San Andreas Fault is: an obduction zone; a subduction zone; a transform plate boundary; none of these; a divergent plate boundary. Orogeny, sea-floor spreading, and continental drift are all related to the action of: magnetism; gravity; convection currents in the mantle; hot spots. We can use paleomagnetic studies to determine:
