Yes. Your digestive system can either slow down and you can get very constipated with pregnancy, or it can speed up and you can get diarrhea. I had diarrhea with my first pregnancy. One time it caught me by surprise and I didn't even make it to the bathroom in time.I'm pregnant again and I tend to be constipated with this one, but still experience a strong urgency to go RIGHT NOW, from time to time. posted 08/27/2007 by Abagayle98. had diarrhea with my first pregnancy.
