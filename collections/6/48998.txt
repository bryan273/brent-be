the leaning tower of pisa is just one of several leaning towers in pisa. A number of other Pisani structures suffer foundational instability thanks to the river cityâ€™s soft grounds. Among these are San Nicola, a 12th century church located about half a mile south of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and San Michele degli Scalzi, an 11th century church about two miles east of the pair. While San Nicola, whose base is rooted beneath the earth, leans only mildly, San Michele degli Scalzi boasts a substantial 5-degree tilt.
