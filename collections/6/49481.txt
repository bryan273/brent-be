College Credit Plus. Great news for home school students! Ohioâ€™s new College Credit Plus program gives students in grades 7-12 the chance to earn high school and college credit simultaneously by taking courses at participating Ohio colleges or universities. Tuition is free if your home school student takes classes at a public college. There may be modest fees for private college credit. The deadline is April 1 for home school students to let the Ohio Department of Education know they want to participate in College Credit Plus next school year.
