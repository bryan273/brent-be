An alternative use of a try-square is to test the edge of a piece of wood to check how square it is (has it got a 90 degree angle along its length?). The try-square and material are held up to the light and the try-square is moved along the length of the wood. If light shines through any gaps between the blade and the wood, then the edge is not square. Draw a woodworkers try-square and label each part. Sketch one typical use of a woodworkers try-square.
