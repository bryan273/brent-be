In either case, when the containers are full, the pressure is approximately 15 atm. At this pressure and at room temperat ure, 85% of its volume is in the liquid state and 15 % is in the vaporous state. When natural gas is used in vehicles (VNG-vehicular natural gas), it is sold at service stations at 200 atm pressure, which is the final pressure in the vehicle's cylinder. Under these conditions, the quantity of natural gas in the cylinder is approximately 30 kg.
