Best Answer: Alcoholometer. An alcoholometer is a hydrometer which is used for determining the alcoholic strength of liquids. It is also known as a proof and traille hydrometer. It only measures the density of the fluid. Certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid. Alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of potential alcohol, based on a pre-calculated specific gravity.
