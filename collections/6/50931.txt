It was no longer used as the primary Auburn logo in 1970, when the interlocking AU was officially licensed by Auburn. Of course, this Aubie head logo was never used on the helmets or anything. It was just the main logo used by Auburn. This logo became an alternate logo when the interlocking AU was created.
