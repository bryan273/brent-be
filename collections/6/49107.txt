Oasis was the first group to sing Wonderwall from their 1995 album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? It was written by guitarist Noel Gallagher. The title comes from a 1968 film of the same name, and the film's score by George Harrison was the song's inspiration. Wonderwall was performed live by Beady Eye at the London 2012 Olympic Closing Ceremony for the first time since Oasis broke up in 2009.
