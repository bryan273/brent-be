To get the best results in your watercolor paintings, you must use the right paper for the job. Two common watercolor paper types are hot pressed paper and cold pressed paper. The names refer to how the paper was made. This process is what creates the differences in texture and performance. Think of hot pressed paper as ironed paper. After it is made, hot pressed paper is pressed flat with hot rollers.
