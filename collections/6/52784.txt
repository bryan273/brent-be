â€• Jorah Mormont. Dothraki is the language spoken by the Dothraki people, the nomadic mounted tribes of the central plains of Essos, known as the Dothraki Sea. The Dothraki do not have their own writing system, nor much use for the writing systems of neighboring peoples, so they are an illiterate society.
