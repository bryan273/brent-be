A beauty is a woman you notice, a charmer is one who notices you. Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do. You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
