Crabapple Trimming Schedule. The best time to trim (prune) a crabapple tree is in early spring, before the tree flowers and before new growth begins. Don't worry about interfering with flowering--provided you don't over-prune, your tree will still develop plenty of blossoms from the branches you leave.
