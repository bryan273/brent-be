Post. Share. Molecular compounds or covalent compounds are those in which the elements share electrons via covalent bonds. The only type of molecular compound a chemistry student is expected to be able to name is a binary covalent compound.This is a covalent compound made up of only two different elements.Here is a look at the nomenclature rules for molecular compounds, plus some examples of how to name the compounds. Molecular compounds contain two or more nonmetals (not the ammonium ion).his is a covalent compound made up of only two different elements.
