Sometimes the winners might not be the best, but most of the time they're. The Academy Awards are rlly good, I watch them evry year since 2002, and I've liked them almost always. The previous one, I thought The Curious Case of Benjamin Button would win, but Slumdog Millionaire did. I actually liked both of them, and now I think Slumdog was better, but both were rlly good.
