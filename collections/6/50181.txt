Damage to the building could exceed the coverage limits of “Damage to Premises Rented to You”. Not all causes of loss may be covered. For example, a tenant’s employee damages the building while operating a forklift, which is not a covered cause of loss. Damage to the premises is covered but the equipment is not.
