Video Quality. With a Blu-ray player and Blu-ray discs, you’ll receive full 1080p HD video quality. This is better than streaming 1080p video through the internet, because even though you’re streaming the same video resolution as Blu-ray, there will be compression algorithms applied to the streaming video.
