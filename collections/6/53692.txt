a plowing disk is sometimes called a disk plow. If that is what you are talking about 6 foot is all that hp will handle and that is pulling it. If you mean the older one way disk plows with larger blades of 24 or more, then you are talking about the same disks as the tractor is rated to plow with a moldboard.My dad had an old disk plow for an H and it was great in sprouts back in the day. 06-04-2009, 01:01 PM #4.Elite Member.n other words if you see an eight ft disc with the blades and spacing you want and needs 80 hp to pull it then a your using about 10 hp per ft of width. Just transpose the numbers to get the info you want. Disk plows are not a bad idea, if you are making multiple passes the ridges should be cancelled out.
