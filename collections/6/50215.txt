Prefix Names of Covalent Compounds. Covalent compounds are named in different ways than are ionic compounds (although there is some overlap). Many of these compounds have common names such as methane, ammonia and water.However, simple covalent compounds are generally named by using prefixes to indicate how many atoms of each element are shown in the formula.Also, the ending of the last (most negative) element is changed to-ide. The prefixes used are mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and so forth.n Lesson 7 you learned how to name ionic compounds; we'll round out your nomenclature skills in this lesson with naming covalent compounds. Simple names are used for ionic compounds (and some covalent compounds) where only one compound is made from those elements.
