Such volcanoes are devastating, but very rare. The last one happened at Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia, 74,000 years ago. The active volcanic system at Yellowstone National Park has resulted in super-eruptions-the most recent happened 640,000 years ago. Yellowstone's volcanism is powered by magma rising from a hotspot.
