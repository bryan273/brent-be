They may have avoided a surgery. I only order MRIs if they arenâ€™t getting better. However, if I have a patient with a long history of shoulder pain and weakness and they are very weak on examination, I sometimes do order an MRI after the first office visit. Degenerative rotator cuff tears are extremely common.
