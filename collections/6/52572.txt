Which degree equips students better for the market: an MS software engineering vs an MS in computer science? Between a software engineering and a computer science master's which degree is more likely to prepare a student better for the job market? I understand that software engineering degrees do not impart specialised knowledge such as machine learning that computer science masters can offer - can this necessarily be a disadvantage ?
