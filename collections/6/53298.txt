Her brother’s basis in the shares he purchased is the purchase price of $7,000. When he sells the stock for $12,000, he has a $5,000 realized gain ($12,000 - $7,000). He only has to recognize $2,000 of the gain, however, as he can offset his sister’s unrecognized $3,000 loss against his $5,000 gain.
