User Reviews. In this ep of The Big Bang Theory: Amy tells Sheldon she's going to work at his place of employment which seems fine with Sheldon... until Howard mentions how he doesn't want wife Bernadette to be at his workplace all the time which doesn't go well with her when she hears about it from Sheldon.
