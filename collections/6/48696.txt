I was fortunate enough to attend the Iowa Bench-Bar Conference in 2012, and found it to be a tremendous experience--especially for a greenhorn‚Äù attorney like me. It was a great opportunity to meet attorneys, judges, and justices from throughout the state in an environment much less formal than that of a courtroom.
