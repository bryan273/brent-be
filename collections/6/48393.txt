Observe that the logarithmic function f (x) = log b x is the inverse of the exponential function g (x) = bx. It has the following properties. 1  The domain is the set of all positive real numbers. 2  f (x) = log b x is not defined for negative values of x, or for 0. (Since the logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, the domain of logarithmic function is the range of exponential function, and vice versa.). 2  The function is continuous and one-to-one.
