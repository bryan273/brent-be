profit percentage (profit divided by cost) = $50/$100 = 50% profit percentage. R.O.I. (return on investment) multiple = $50/$100 (profit divided by cost). If your revenue is the same as your cost, that doesn't equate to 100% return on investment, it equates to 0%. The result above or below 100% can be calculated as the percentage of return on investment.
