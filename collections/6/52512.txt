Just because it’s natural, honey isn’t always good for us. ‘Honey can cause digestive issues,’ says Dr Read. ‘It contains lots of fructose and this is not well absorbed in the gut, so can be fermented to gas and cause bloating. If you add honey to a bran cereal, you might be heading for stomach trouble.’. Another sweetener that can cause bloating and IBS problems is sorbitol.
