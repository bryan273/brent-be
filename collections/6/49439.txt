TMJ and swollen lymph nodes . I was wondering if anyone has had their lymph nodes in the jaw and neck area swell occasionally because of TMJ? I have noticed mine do every now and then but then seem to go back to normal. My neck muscles stay tight and inflamed and my neck is hard to turn to the side sometimes. I was just wondering if anyone can relate? Thanks for any info!!
