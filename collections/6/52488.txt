A frozen bank account is a bank account that you cannot access because a creditor has placed a levy on it. When your bank account is frozen, you can put money into it, but you can't take money out.owever, a creditor or debt collector is required to notify you (1) that it has filed a lawsuit against you; and (2) that it has obtained a judgment against you. If your first notice of the court case is a frozen bank account, you have not received proper notice under the law.
