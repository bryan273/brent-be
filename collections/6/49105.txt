The song’s title is a loose nod to ‘Wonderwall Music’ – George Harrison’s 1968 film OST and the first Beatles solo album. “The Beatles are, to me, the be-all and end-all. Where it starts and where it finishes,” Noel said in 1995. Comparisons to the Liverpool band, of course, followed Oasis throughout their career.
