Undergraduate Residences â€“ 2017-18 Academic Year. New residents usually are not assigned to rooms whose rates are at the upper end of these rate ranges. Such rooms as singles and rooms with bath are most often assigned to returning students. Most new student assignments will be made to the lowest rate room type in each residence. Students assigned to the undergraduate residences and in attendance at the University for only one semester may calculate the rate by dividing the academic year rates listed below in half.
