The course also offers commanding views over the wine region of Hawkes Bay and the nearby small port town of Napier. PLEASE NOTE: The shipâ€™s scheduled stop in Napier allows only time for 9 holes at Cape Kidnappers, and consequently we have included 9 holes in the golf package. Guests wishing to play 18 holes may utilize our optional Cape Kidnappers/The Kinloch Club overnight option below.
