Liquidation of Assets. The liquidation of assets is one of the first activities that must occur after a small business dissolves. Liquidation refers to the sale or auction of the physical and intangible assets of the business. For example, the small business must sell all of its office furniture, equipment and supplies. Intangible assets might include patents or stock.
