Posted by Brandon on 08/20/2014. So far, 22 states recognize concealed carry permits issued by Illinois. The last state in the country to allow concealed carry, over 70,000 permits have been issued since the laws went into effect earlier this year. The reason that states have been quick to recognize the Illinois permits is most likely because of their strict requirements, which includes a 16-hour safety course.
