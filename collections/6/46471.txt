On average, your local grocery store and butcher will sell ribeye steak for as little as $7 to as much as $17 per pound. For instance, a thick USDA Prime cut could cost $12 to $17 a pound, while a USDA Choice can cost less than $10 per pound. Ultimately, the costs will depend on the cut, where you purchase it and your geographical location.
