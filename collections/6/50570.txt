By Kathy Huber. Q. A 25-foot Mexican fan palm dominates our garden. We prune the lower tier of fronds as they die. The healthy fronds always sprout from the top so the tree is not only getting oversized for the yard, it's also getting more difficult to prune. If we cut the trunk at 8 feet, will the tree survive?
