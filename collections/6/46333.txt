Picking a well-draining soil is crucial for growing papayas, go for a potting mix or make your own. Soils that don't drain well can cause root rot that will easily kill even a fully grown papaya. Don't worry about fertilizing your papaya seedlings, they won't need it until they are at least 6 months - 1 year old.
