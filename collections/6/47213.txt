Your employee has been summoned to jury duty in the United States District Court. Jurors are obligated to remain 'on call' for jury service up to 4 weeks. During that time, they may be called to serve on a jury. Jurors normally serve from 9AM to 5PM.f your employment policy is against paying employees while they are on jury duty, you are now asked to reconsider that policy. Federal jurors are paid $40.00 per day for their service. Paying the difference between your employee's salary and the juror attendance fee is strongly encouraged, if possible.
