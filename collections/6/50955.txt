STEREOISOMERISM-OPTICAL ISOMERISM. Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. This page explains what stereoisomers are and how you recognise the possibility of optical isomers in a molecule.his enantiomer is known as the (+) form. For example, one of the optical isomers (enantiomers) of the amino acid alanine is known as (+)alanine. A solution of the other enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in an anti-clockwise direction. This enantiomer is known as the (-) form.
