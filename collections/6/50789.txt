Leona Lewis â€“ The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face lyrics. The first time ever I saw your face. I thought the sun rose in your eyes. And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave. To the dark and the endless skies my love. The first time ever I kissed your mouth. I felt the earth move through my hands.
