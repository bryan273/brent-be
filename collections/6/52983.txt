Buoyed by this overwhelming reception, Schaefer became a full-time writer and wrote several other memorable novels, short-story collections, and historical books. Shane, though, has remained Schaefer’s most popular and influential work, in part due to the wider audience the film version captured for the story. Like the protagonist of Owen Wister’s 1902 novel, The Virginian, Schaefer’s Shane helped construct the popular image of the western cowboy as an all-natural nobleman on horseback.
