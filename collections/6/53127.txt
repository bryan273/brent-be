While many refer to scrub jays as blue jays, the blue jay is a different species of bird entirely. In recent years, the California scrub jay has expanded its range north into the Puget Sound region of Washington.hey are California scrub jay (coastal), Woodhouse's scrub jay (interior US and northern Mexico), and Sumichrast's scrub jay (interior southern Mexico). The western scrub jay was once lumped with the island scrub jay and the Florida scrub jay; the taxon was then called, simply, the scrub jay.
