Welcome to the Latin Dictionary! Latin is a base language by which the Romance languages (including Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, and Romanian) are based from. However, the Latin language itself is not spoken by very many people; Latin is the official language only in the city-state, Vatican City.
