Cut back the spent stems of small (with leaves only 3 to 4 inches long), young (orchids that have bloomed for the first time) or thin, wilted orchids. Use a pair of pruning shears to cut the stem back as close to its base as possible without cutting any of the leaves. This will prevent the plant from re-flowering on that stem, which takes energy that it may not have. The orchid will flower again in a year or so when it grows a new stem.
