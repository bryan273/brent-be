Most agents over look Fire Legal Liability. It is important to insure for a limit equal to the value of the area of the building you are renting or leasing. Most policies only contain $50,000 of fire legal liability. Say for example you occupy 5000 square feet of a 30,000 square foot building. Therefore you occupy 1/6 of the building. If the building you lease is valued at $3,000,000 you need your fire legal liability to be $500,000 at least. That is 1/6 of the total value of the building. Also you need to understand that fire legal liability only pertains to the space you rent or lease.
