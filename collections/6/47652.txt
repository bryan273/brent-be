SOMAY began making protective coatings as an answer to the “Miami” hurricane of 1926. This innovative approach begun by SOMAY’s founder Sy Green, 89 years ago, has continued to drive SOMAY to stay at the forefront of the protective coatings industry, with products such as SOMAY “Roof Mastic”, “Steri-Shield”, and HYCOTE 151.
