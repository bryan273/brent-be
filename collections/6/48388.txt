We have to find the domain of the function y= ln (x^2 - 3x + 2). Now domain refers to all the values of x for which y exists. Here y will exist for all values of x that allow x^2 - 3x + 2 to be positive as the logarithm for 0 or negative values is not defined.So the domain of the function is all values of greater than 2 and less than 1.giorgiana1976 | College Teacher | (Level 3) Valedictorian.

In the domain of definition of the given function there are found all the admissible values of x for the logarithmic function to exist.o the domain of the function is all values of greater than 2 and less than 1. giorgiana1976 | College Teacher | (Level 3) Valedictorian.
