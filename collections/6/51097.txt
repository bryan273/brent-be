How does the ArcticBlu™ Cooling Towel Work? The ArcticBlu™ material is highly absorbent, (like a sponge) and can absorb up to 8 times its weight in water. Once wet, the towels produce a cooling affect with the help of simple evaporation. As long as the towel is wet, the towels will stay cool. Exposure to the air will keep it cooler even longer.
