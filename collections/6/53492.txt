Irrigation can benefit people who have sinus problems, nasal allergies, colds, and even flu symptoms. It can help both adults and kids. Some people use it every day to stay symptom-free. You shouldn't use it, though, if you have an ear infection or a nostril that's plugged and hard to breathe through.
