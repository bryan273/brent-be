The Roman calendar, or “pre-Julian” calendar, was created during the founding of Rome and is believed to have been a lunar calendar. The calendar originally consisted of hollow months that were 29 days long or full months that had 30 days. The Colosseum in Rome is one of the most famous Roman ruins.
