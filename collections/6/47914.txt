French (language) with 60+ answers. Usually in English you would say have a great day after running into someone and having a conversation, and then parting ways. In French, the normal way to say this is, Bonne journée!, which literally means [Have a] good day! and is specifically used in this situation. (Adrien Grandemange's answer to 'Bonne journée' vs. 'Bonjour' sums it up perfectly.) The same phrase could be used in more or less formal situations.
