The word processor divides lines in such a way that a word is never split between two lines (unless the word processor supports hyphenation). Word wrap also occurs if you change the margins. In this case, the word processor readjusts all the text so that it fits within the new margins. Note that word wrap inserts a soft return at the end of each line, not a hard return. Soft returns are invisible codes that the word processor utilizes.
