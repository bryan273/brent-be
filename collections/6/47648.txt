Acrylux Roof Mastic. Acrylux Roof Mastic forms a thick waterproof membrane when rolled on in two thick heavy coats. When applied to a seamless well pitched roof like cement tile or shingles, Roof Mastic will provide years of waterproof protection and extend the life of an aging roof. A thick layer of roof mastic will expand and contract like flexible rubber and keeps water out while protecting and maintaining breathability.
