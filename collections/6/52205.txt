The bad news about walking is, you don't burn a lot of calories doing it. The good news is, you do burn some. How much weight you can lose walking a mile each day depends on how fast you walk and your current weight. If you combine exercise with a low-calorie diet, you will lose weight more quickly. Walking has benefits beyond just weight loss; it can help increase your metabolism slightly, for a short time.
