A principal focus or focal point is a special focus: For a lens, or a spherical or parabolic mirror, it is a point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused. Since light can pass through a lens in either direction, a lens has two focal pointsâ€”one on each side. The distance in air from the lens or mirror's principal plane to the focus is called the focal length.
