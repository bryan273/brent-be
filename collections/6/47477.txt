If you want to acquire temporary rights to tangible property such as a house or car, you rent or lease them from someone. If you want temporary rights to someone elseâ€™s intellectual property, you license those rights. To relinquish your rights to tangible property without receiving any compensation, you give away the property. To do the same thing with intellectual property rights, you would waive those rights. If someone takes your tangible property without your consent, that property is considered stolen. If someone uses your about patents, copyrights, or trademarks without your permission, those rights are considered to be infringed.
