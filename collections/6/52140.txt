Phalaenopsis orchids are especially unique in that they have the ability rebloom from an inflorescence (the part of the stem from where the flower grows) that has already bloomed! First, if the spike begins to turn brown then that means it’s not going to bloom again – at least not without some help. You basically have three options regarding what to do with your spike once it’s finished blooming. And whichever option you go with, you want to make sure you use a sterile cutting tool.
