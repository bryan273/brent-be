Plan out where you would like your fence posts to go. You will want the distance between the posts to be 2 inches shorter than the length of each rail to allow for a slight overlap. Each time you determine where a post should go, place a stake in the ground.lace one of your posts in each of the holes you dug. The holes for the rails (two in each post) should face to the sides, not in toward the yard. Double-check the distance between each post with the tape measure. If any are too close or too far apart, you can't install the rails right.
