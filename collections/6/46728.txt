Reviewed 2 days ago NEW. Area is lovely, tucked away behind Blanchard surrounded by forest and mountains. Bed is comfortable enough, but living room furniture is a little south of comfort. Kitchen had the basics for meal prep and all appliances were in working order. Staff were friendly and helpful.
