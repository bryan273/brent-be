Meanwhile Burnside, on the left, and Warren, on the right, had made attacks on Lee's wings, but were repulsed. At midnight Robert El Lee withdrew to his second line, and Hancock finally held the works he had captured in the morning, with twenty-two guns. So ended the battle of Spotsylvania Court-house.
