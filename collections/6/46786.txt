Apheresis platelet donors are a special and dedicated group. They give two hours of their time to help patients in need, sometimes as often as every two weeks. Platelets can also be processed from a regular whole blood donation, but an adequate dose requires that multiple donations be pooled from many donors. Most patients who need platelets have weakened immune systems and a platelet dose from a single apheresis donor is preferred by many physicians. During a platelet donation, a small portion of the donorâ€™s blood is drawn and passed through a sophisticated cell-separating machine.
