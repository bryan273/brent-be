The fruit of the mamey is pink, and roughly oblong to circular in size. Large specimens can measure around 10 inches (25 centimeters) in length. The seed is toxic, and found in the center of the fruit; toxic extracts from the sapote seed are used in a variety of applications, including as an insecticide.
