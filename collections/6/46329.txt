Papayas have a lot of seeds in them, so one papaya is enough to get a decent sized plantation going. Of course most growers don't want (or have the space) for that many papayas, luckily the seeds stay viable for at least a few years so you don't have to grow them all at once. When collecting seeds from a papaya fruit you will notice jelly-like capsules surrounding each seed.
