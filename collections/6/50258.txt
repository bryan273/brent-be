Marijuana Businesses Embrace New Drug at Center of DEA Crackdown in Calif. While Drug Enforcement Administration agents in California are cracking down on the popular new drug known as “wax,” people in Colorado are rushing to embrace it. Wax, the ultimate distillation of marijuana, is so potent that it is said a single hit will keep a person high for more than a day. Making the drug is risky. Butane, a substance so flammable that any spark can set off an explosion, is used to strip out the THC, the chemical in marijuana that gets a person high. But law enforcement says the process of making wax is not the only thing dangerous about it.
