Ankle X-ray: An X-ray film of the ankle is most commonly used to determine a fracture, arthritis, or other problems. Stress X-ray: A doctor puts pressure on an injured ankle and takes an X-ray film. Also called a stress film or a stress test, this may uncover ankle problems unseen on regular X-rays.
