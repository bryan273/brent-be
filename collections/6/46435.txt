Delicately flavored with floral extracts, citrus essences, and exotic spicesâ€”each blend is as delectable and delightful as the next. Kusmi Tea presents their teas both in 4.4 oz loose leaf tins and boxes of 20 hand-stitched muslin tea bags. The tins and boxes are beautifully styled in the original packaging that Pavel Kousmichoff used in 1867. Let the pleasant, smooth tastes of these expertly blended teas bring you back to the days of the tsars!
