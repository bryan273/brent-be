It seems like today, more than ever, commonalities in cultural practice are all over the place when thinking transnationally. To me for better or worse, the words neo-liberalism, globalization, etc. etc. come to mind. However, I think the most interesting space for discussing transnational cultural practice is in the realm of technology. The world grows smaller as modes and vehicles of communication become faster, more efficient and more easily accessible globally.
