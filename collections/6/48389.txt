1 (Since the logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, the domain of logarithmic function is the range of exponential function, and vice versa.). 2  The function is continuous and one-to-one.3  The y-axis is the asymptote of the graph. 4  The graph intersects the x-axis at (1, 0). (Since the logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, the domain of logarithmic function is the range of exponential function, and vice versa.). 2  The function is continuous and one-to-one.
