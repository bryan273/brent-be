Teaching Qualifications need in an International School. I am a U.S. citizen living in Luzern with a C Visa. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree and my major was Communications with almost a completed minor in Social Work. I want to get a job in teaching in an international school in Switzerland. I have my TEFL certificate and I have worked as a teacher teaching English as a second language.
