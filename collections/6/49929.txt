A second way to short stocks is to use put options contracts. These contracts are the right to put the stock to a buyer at a fixed price at a date in the future. They are essentially a bet that a stock will go down. If you own a put, and you keep it through expiration, and the stock is at $20 and the put you hold has a strike price of $25, you can buy the stock at $20 and put it to the seller of the put at $25.
