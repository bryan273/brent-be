Best Answer: You have TMJ dysfunction (aka TMD) and the popping is due to a part of the jaw joint called the articular disk dislocating when your teeth are together and popping back into place when your mouth is open. So when your teeth are together the jaw joint is already dislocated. When the disk pops out of place (when your teeth are together) it usually goes back into joint when you open and this is called reciprocal clicking and is an early stage of TMD (aka TMJ).
