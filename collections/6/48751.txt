When you move into a rental space and the open floor plan doesn't suit your purpose, erecting a temporary partition wall is one way to adapt it without making permanent changes that the landlord may not like. Builders also use temporary walls to support the ceiling while they make changes to a bearing wall.The hallmarks of a well-executed temporary wall are that it looks like a permanent wall and leaves no trace when you remove it. It isn't that difficult to fulfill these conditions in a room with drywall-covered walls.. Mark the ends of the wall on the ceiling with masking tape. Measure the distance between the marks with a tape measure, and cut two lengths of two-by-fours to that length with a circular saw. These will form the top and bottom plates of the wall.
