The national anthem of Morocco-Hymne Cherifien-was adopted during the French rule. Although its tune, which had been written by Leo Morgan, remained the same, the lyrics were changed at the time of its independence. The new lyrics were composed by Ali Squalli Houssaini at the time of the country's independence in 1956.
