The domain of rhe function is the set of values of x for which the y is defined. Let f(x) = x^2-3x+2. x^2 -3x+2 = (x-1)(x-2). So x1 = 1 and x2 = 2. Therefore, the domain x of y = ln(x^22-3x+2) is x in (-infinity, 1) or (2 ,ifinity).o the domain of the function is all values of greater than 2 and less than 1. giorgiana1976 | College Teacher | (Level 3) Valedictorian.
