I brought this up yesterday as well. Breda is in the secret lair, (after a werewolf on the map you are currently playing at) tells you to defend the secret lair you have to go back and defend 3 waves of monsters, at the end Breda shows up. You probably skipped that text, just go back to the secret lair to finish the quest and kill the waves + Breda.
