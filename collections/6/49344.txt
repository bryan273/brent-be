When your body fluids contain too much acid, this is known as acidosis. Acidosis occurs when your kidneys and lungs can’t keep your body’s pH in balance. Many of the body’s processes produce acid. For instance, your lungs and kidneys can usually compensate for slight pH imbalances, but problems with these organs can lead to excess acid in your body.
