For casual and smart-casual offices, sandals are a summer work shoe staple. Heeled or wedge sandals are a great option for style and suitability, but there are various work-appropriate flat sandals as well. Wear them with a knee-length summery dress or a pair of cropped pants. Just donâ€™t wear flip-flops to the office!
