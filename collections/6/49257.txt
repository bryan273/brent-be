having similar fluid flow characteristics. Other similar definitions have been referred to as petrophysical rock types, reservoir rock types, and static rock types. Common to all of these rock type definitions is an attempt to correlate the pore structure (i.e., pore and pore throat dimensions, geometry, size, distribution, etc.) to physical rock properties such as effective porosity and absolute permeability.
