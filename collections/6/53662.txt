Phase Change and Latent Heat. 1  There is chemical potential energy in the weak van der Waals attractions as well as in the strong ionic and covalent bonds. 2  Because the van der Waals attraction is so much weaker, there is much less chemical potential possible here, but it is a major factor in the energy of phase changes.
