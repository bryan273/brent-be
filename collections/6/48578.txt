All eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The types and quantities of other membrane-bound organelles vary with the type of cell. Examples incl. endoplasmic reticulum (SER, RER), golgi apparatus, mitochondia, lysosomes, peroxisomes and microbodies & chloroplasts (in photosynthetic cells only; not in animal cells).ll eukaryotic cells have a nucleus.
