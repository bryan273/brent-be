Shift plants. To ensure plant survival in containers through winter, select plants hardy to two zones lower than yours. Alternatively, lift plants from containers for winter and tuck them into soil in a planting bed, vegetable garden, or near a compost bin. Soil insulates roots and helps plants survive winter. Tuck plants into soil 1 to 2 inches deeper than they normally sit in a container. Return the plants to containers in spring. Mulch mums. In the northern third of the country, garden mums planted in fall most likely wonâ€™t survive winter even if you transfer them to in-ground beds. Improve their odds by skipping the pots altogether and tucking them into soil at the start of fall.
