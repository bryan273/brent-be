Kansas Zip Codes. Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name is often said to mean people of the wind or people of the south wind, although this was probably not the term's original meaning.
