The connection between the molecules, called an acetal oxygen bridge, makes sucrose a non-reducing sugar, which means itâ€™s less reactive than most other sugars. This doesn't affect its digestion or function in your body, but it makes a difference during cooking. Because it's non-reducing, sucrose can't participate in a chemical change called the Maillard reaction -- this allows other sugars to interact with amino acids in food, turning food brown and boosting its flavor.
