Best Answer: All lizards have tails and all lizards can lose their tails, but not all lizards can grow them back. The tail is an important structure. We know that individuals with tails can run faster than those without tails. got a pet lepord gecko and she got stuck in a hole. My dad was pulling her out by the tail and she dropped her tail. I know that lizards can drop their tails and regrow them, but how long will it take for her to regrow her tail. By the way we did get her out and that hole is not their anymore.
