Rimadyl and Side Effects Max pulled something falling down a rabbit hole few days ago and it wasn't getting too much better so, today we took him to vet. He has in the distant past had one injection of anti-inflammatory which was fine, but this time following thorough examination, vet decided joints/bones good and strong and suspected muscular/tendon trouble.
