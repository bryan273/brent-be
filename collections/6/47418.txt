There are many methods to cook a chicken. A roast chicken is a whole chicken cooked in the oven. A 5-lb. chicken should take between 1 hour and 30 minutes and 2 hours and at 375 F in the oven to cook. It takes this long to reach the desired internal temperature of 165 F to kill any food-borne bacteria. The difference in cooking times depends on whether the chicken is stuffed and what kind of stuffing is used.
