The vase for Ancient Greece (1 o’clock, 328 BC) is at the Vikings island (2 o’clock, 831 AD) and is slightly difficult to recover. You will need the barrel of gunpowder from the Great Wall of China (6 o’clock, 1593 AD), which is where you’d be going for the Thor Amulet as well. Both are on the right side of the Wall. Bring the gunpowder to the rocked-up cave on the hill at the Viking island. It will blast the rocks away and you can enter the cave.
