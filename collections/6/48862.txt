What Bert Has To Say About Flagstaff Metro Area. Flagstaff is an old Route 66 railroad town, located in the high plateau of the San Francisco Mountains. The city has the second highest altitude among metropolitan areas, and thus escapes the desert heat associated with much of Arizona. Serving as a gateway for the Grand Canyon National Park, the predominant industry is tourism, supported by motel and restaurant strips. Downtown is clean with a strong Western feel.
