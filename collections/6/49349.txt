INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION. Lactate levels greater than 2 mmol/L represent hyperlactatemia, whereas lactic acidosis is generally defined as a serum lactate concentration above 4 mmol/L. Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients. Although the acidosis is usually associated with an elevated anion gap, increased lactate levels can also be observed with a normal anion gap (most often if hypoalbuminemia is not identified and used to correct the anion gap).
