Go to the Great Wall of China (6 o'clock, 1593 AD). Go all the way right to get the gunpowder (while you are there you can also get Thor's Amulet on the scaffolding above). Go â€¦ to the Vikings time (2 o'clock, 831 AD) and climb the mountain. Use the gunpowder to blast the rocks and enter the cave. When you do, you must move quickly because the torch is going out.
