Alternatively, a nasal bulb syringe can be used with a homemade salt-water mixture. Directions: Place the above mixture in a reusable sinus rinse bottle or draw up into a nasal bulb syringe. The most convenient way to perform a sinus rinse is in the shower, but may also be performed over a sink. The head should be tilted down, with the rinse bottle or bulb syringe placed into one nostril.
