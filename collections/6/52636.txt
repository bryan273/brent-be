Those loans are called fed funds. Banks use these funds to meet the federal reserve requirement each night. If they don't have enough reserves, they will borrow the Fed funds needed to do so from each other. Since the banks set the rate, the Fed is actually setting a target for this important interest rate. By law, the banks can actually set any rate they want. However, this is rarely a problem. They normally meet the Fed's target because the Fed gives them several strong incentives to do so.
