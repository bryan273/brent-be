You can claim an 18 year old until the year they turn 19 no matter how much they earn as long as you are providing over half her support.(she must also be unmarried to do so) After that it depends upon how much she earned a number that changes every year so I can't tell you what it will be next year.ou can still claim her if she is older, a full time student, and does not earn enough to need to file a federal tax return and of course, as long as you are providing for her care.
