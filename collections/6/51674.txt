Examine the root you want to cut. If possible, trace it back to the trunk of the tree from which it grows. Is it one of the largest roots? If so, you’re a lot more likely to damage the tree by cutting it. If it’s relatively small though, you can probably remove it without any major issues. Figure out the right place to cut the root. You shouldn’t just cut the root at random. A good rule of thumb is to measure the diameter of the trunk of the tree in inches. Multiply that number by eight. The total represents the closest place where you can safely cut the root of the tree.
