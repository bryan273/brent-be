1 To determine the gross profit margin, a business looks at the retail price of its product and subtracts the cost of materials and labor used to produce it. 2  It then divides that by the retail price. 3  For example, if you sell a product for $25, and it costs $20 to make, the gross profit margin is 20% ($5 divided by $25).
