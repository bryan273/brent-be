Even vegans can and do get gout. But if this was gout, I suspect the description would be a lot more explicit because while a gout attack in the foot does cause swelling and soreness, the pain is usually excruciating, not just sore. Whether the OP's BF's issues are caused by red meat though, I have no idea. The only way to find out is to cut the red meat, and only the red meat, out of the diet for a sufficient length of time to see if there is a change. If there is, add it back in and see if the issue can be repeated. It may not necessarily be red meat in general, but a particular type of meat or additives in the meat depending on what kind of meat it is and where it comes from.
