Who came up with the name? Kittalaus did. As he revealed at a startup conference in Chicago this week, he planned to name his daughter Siri after a former coworker (in Norwegian, Siri means beautiful woman who leads you to victory) and even registered the domain Siri.com. Then he and his wife had a son, and the website was shelved.
