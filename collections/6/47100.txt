Cause of Tinnitus: Not sure. I've had this for many years Jade. My jaw clicks and in the past people have actually heard it when I eat. Often, the right hand side of my jaw feels as though it will 'pop out'. I was told that I do have mild TMJ and the consultant could feel that my jaw was slightly misaligned.
