Surgery may be used to treat a torn rotator cuff if the injury is very severe or if nonsurgical treatment has failed to improve shoulder strength and movement sufficiently. Surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff tendon usually involves: 1  Removing loose fragments of tendon, bursa, and other debris from the space in the shoulder where the rotator cuff moves (debridement). 2  Making more room for the rotator cuff tendon so it is not pinched or irritated.
