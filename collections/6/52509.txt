Bloating and Upset Stomach. Gas has buoyancy and gas pockets can become trapped in the upper and lower intestines. The gas acts like a cork, impeding or halting the flow of gastric juices and causing pressure to be built up. This pressure causes painful bloating and swelling of the abdomen. When gas pockets form in the stomach, this can cause the stomach to distend, causing discomfort or pain.
