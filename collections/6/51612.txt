Most of the increase was people who reported their race as both black and white, a group that rose to 1.8 million last year, compared with 785,000 in the 2000 census. The 130% increase was the largest by percentage among any group or subgroup in the white or black populations, the census information showed. A total of 42 million identified themselves as black alone or in a combination with other races, comprising 14% of the total U.S. population.
