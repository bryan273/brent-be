Out of various causes which induce harmonics in the air gap, the field effects of stator-rotor slot combinations are the common causes for high magnetic noise in induction motors [3], [4], [5]. Finley [4] discussed various techniques to decrease the magnetic noise in electric motors. A good literature review on this topic could be found in [7]. This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of magnetic noise in induction motors. Numerical results are
