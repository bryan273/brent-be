Obama claimed that his health care reform plan (now called Obamacare) would not allocate money for illegal immigrants. According to Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), the Congressman who yelled out at Obama, nearly $8.5 million has been set aside for seasonal farm workers.. Wilson says this group is made up mostly of illegal immigrants. Now the Congressman says he was right.
