a) What minimum frequency of light is needed to supply the required energy? b) What is the wavelength of this light? c) If potassium is irradiated with light having wavelength of 350 nm... Chemistry Ionization energy is defined as the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the ground state (n0) to infinity (nâˆž). Determine the wavelength of radiation required to ionize the hydrogen electron from the n = 2 energy level. Calculate the energy (Joules) ... chemistry please help
