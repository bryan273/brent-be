‘Car title slip’, also known as the ‘pink slip’ is a document that proves the ownership of a car or vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) of a state issues the title letter to an applicant once he or she has applied. It is one of the most important documents one should get made on the purchase or sale of a car.
