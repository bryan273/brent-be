Sorry Anonymous, you are wrong..I had the widow maker (100%blockade ). My pain was on the upper right side of my chest straight through to my right shoulder blade. My late husband ( passed due to cancer) only had problem with breath, no pain. Plus FYI Rosie O'Donnell was only sore in her arms... There different signs for everybody... Just thought you would like to know.
