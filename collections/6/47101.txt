Temporo-mandibular syndrome is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain. Headache, popping/clicking noise in the jaw joint and jaw pain are the common symptoms. Proper diagnosis is the key to successful treatment. See Orofacial Pain practitioner for a consultation and treatment options.
