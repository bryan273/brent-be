This enantiomer is known as the (+) form. For example, one of the optical isomers (enantiomers) of the amino acid alanine is known as (+)alanine. A solution of the other enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in an anti-clockwise direction.This enantiomer is known as the (-) form.his enantiomer is known as the (+) form.
