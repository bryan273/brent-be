Where Does Marijuana Come From? Marijuana is the dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa). Like all plants it's sensitive to the environment where it grows. Different weather and soil conditions can change the amounts of the chemicals inside the plant. That means marijuana grown in a place like Hawaii might be chemically different than marijuana from Mexico or vice-versa.
