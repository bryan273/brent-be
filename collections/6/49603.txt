The second is conjugation, which allows for the transfer of DNA through a structure called a pilus from one cell to another. Bacterial conjugation can be likened to the mating rituals of other species in the sense that it requires direct cell-to-cell contact and involves the exchange of genetic material. The final mechanism of horizontal gene transfer is transduction, which uses bacteria viruses to transfer DNA from one cell to another. Transduction does not require direct contact like conjugation. And unlike transformation, it needs a third party to help transfer the gene.
