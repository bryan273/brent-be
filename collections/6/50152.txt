I'm working with alot of speakers and Equipment, these wattage concerns are ticking me off. I have a Speaker with 400 watt output, I would assume this is Loud but a friend told me I should care about RMS wattage, which will be alot lower. How can I really get a good idea of how loud a speaker is and how much it...
