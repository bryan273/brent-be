What Is a Lipase Test? Your pancreas makes an enzyme called lipase. When you eat, lipase is released into your digestive tract to help your intestines break down the fats in the food youâ€™re eating. Lipase also allows cell nutrients and cell waste to move through the walls of the cells in your body.
