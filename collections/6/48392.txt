1 The range is the set of all real numbers. ( 2 Since the logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, the domain of logarithmic function is the range of exponential function, and vice versa.). 3  The function is continuous and one-to-one. 4  The y-axis is the asymptote of the graph. (Since the logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, the domain of logarithmic function is the range of exponential function, and vice versa.). 2  The function is continuous and one-to-one.
