All the planets in the solar system spin on their axes (so does the Sun!) and so they have day and night cycles. There are differences, however, in the length of day and night. Some planets rotate faster than Earth and some rotate slower. Mars has a day/night cycle similar to Earth. Mars rotates on its axis once every 24.6 hours. Venus turns once on its axis every 243 Earth days (which is a little longer than it takes for Venus to go around the Sun!).
